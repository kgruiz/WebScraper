     Welcome to Typst's tutorial! In this tutorial, you will learn how to write and format documents in Typst. We will start with everyday tasks and gradually introduce more advanced features. This tutorial does not assume prior knowledge of Typst, other markup languages, or programming. We do assume that you know how to edit a text file.

     When to use Typst
    </h2>
    <p>
     Before we get started, let's check what Typst is and when to use it. Typst is a markup language for typesetting documents. It is designed to be easy to learn, fast, and versatile. Typst takes text files with markup in them and outputs PDFs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Typst is a good choice for writing any long form text such as essays, articles, scientific papers, books, reports, and homework assignments. Moreover, Typst is a great fit for any documents containing mathematical notation, such as papers in the math, physics, and engineering fields. Finally, due to its strong styling and automation features, it is an excellent choice for any set of documents that share a common style, such as a book series.
