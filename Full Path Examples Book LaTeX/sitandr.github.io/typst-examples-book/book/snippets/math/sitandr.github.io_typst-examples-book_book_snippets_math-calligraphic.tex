Unfortunately, currently just
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ stylistic-set\ }}\texttt{\ } for math creates bad
spacing. Math engine detects if the letter should be correctly spaced by
whether it is the default font. However, just making it "normal"
isn\textquotesingle t enough, because than it can be reduced.
That\textquotesingle s way the snippet is as hacky as it is (probably
should be located in Typstonomicon, but it\textquotesingle s not large
enough).
