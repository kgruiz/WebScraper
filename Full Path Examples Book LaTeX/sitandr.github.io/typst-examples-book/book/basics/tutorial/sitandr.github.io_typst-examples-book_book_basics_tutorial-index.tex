\section{\texorpdfstring{\hyperref[tutorial-by-examples]{Tutorial by
Examples}}{Tutorial by Examples}}\label{tutorial-by-examples}

\href{https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/}{Official Tutorial} , with more
specialized examples and less words. It is \emph{highly recommended to
read the official tutorial anyway} .
