\section{Table guide}\label{table-guide}

Tables are a great way to present data to your readers in an easily
readable, compact, and organized manner. They are not only used for
numerical values, but also survey responses, task planning, schedules,
and more. Because of this wide set of possible applications, there is no
single best way to lay out a table. Instead, think about the data you
want to highlight, your document\textquotesingle s overarching design,
and ultimately how your table can best serve your readers.

Typst can help you with your tables by automating styling, importing
data from other applications, and more! This guide takes you through a
few of the most common questions you may have when adding a table to
your document with Typst. Feel free to skip to the section most relevant
to you â€`` we designed this guide to be read out of order.

If you want to look up a detail of how tables work, you should also
\href{/docs/reference/model/table/}{check out their reference page} .
And if you are looking for a table of contents rather than a normal
table, the reference page of the
\href{/docs/reference/model/outline/}{\texttt{\ outline\ } function} is
the right place to learn more.

\subsection{How to create a basic table?}\label{basic-tables}

In order to create a table in Typst, use the
\href{/docs/reference/model/table/}{\texttt{\ table\ } function} . For a
basic table, you need to tell the table function two things:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The number of columns
\item
  The content for each of the table cells
\end{itemize}

So, let\textquotesingle s say you want to create a table with two
columns describing the ingredients for a cookie recipe:

\begin{verbatim}
#table(
  columns: 2,
  [*Amount*], [*Ingredient*],
  [360g], [Baking flour],
  [250g], [Butter (room temp.)],
  [150g], [Brown sugar],
  [100g], [Cane sugar],
  [100g], [70% cocoa chocolate],
  [100g], [35-40% cocoa chocolate],
  [2], [Eggs],
  [Pinch], [Salt],
  [Drizzle], [Vanilla extract],
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/DrLInmCn8ozR2FQ7a7txfwAAAAAAAAAA.png}

This example shows how to call, configure, and populate a table. Both
the column count and cell contents are passed to the table as arguments.
The \href{/docs/reference/foundations/function/}{argument list} is
surrounded by round parentheses. In it, we first pass the column count
as a named argument. Then, we pass multiple
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/content/}{content blocks} as
positional arguments. Each content block contains the contents for a
single cell.

To make the example more legible, we have placed two content block
arguments on each line, mimicking how they would appear in the table.
You could also write each cell on its own line. Typst does not care on
which line you place the arguments. Instead, Typst will place the
content cells from left to right (or right to left, if that is the
writing direction of your language) and then from top to bottom. It will
automatically add enough rows to your table so that it fits all of your
content.

It is best to wrap the header row of your table in the
\href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#definitions-header}{\texttt{\ table.header\ }
function} . This clarifies your intent and will also allow future
versions of Typst to make the output more accessible to users with a
screen reader:

\begin{verbatim}
#table(
  columns: 2,
  table.header[*Amount*][*Ingredient*],
  [360g], [Baking flour],
 // ... the remaining cells
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/aiVJ7GWTsso2QP8oAOCqrgAAAAAAAAAA.png}

You could also write a show rule that automatically
\href{/docs/reference/model/strong/}{strongly emphasizes} the contents
of the first cells for all tables. This quickly becomes useful if your
document contains multiple tables!

\begin{verbatim}
#show table.cell.where(y: 0): strong

#table(
  columns: 2,
  table.header[Amount][Ingredient],
  [360g], [Baking flour],
 // ... the remaining cells
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/U7CxDwHdU4boWRgp53c3XgAAAAAAAAAA.png}

We are using a show rule with a selector for cell coordinates here
instead of applying our styles directly to \texttt{\ table.header\ } .
This is due to a current limitation of Typst that will be fixed in a
future release.

Congratulations, you have created your first table! Now you can proceed
to \hyperref[column-sizes]{change column sizes} ,
\hyperref[strokes]{adjust the strokes} , \hyperref[fills]{add striped
rows} , and more!

\subsection{How to change the column sizes?}\label{column-sizes}

If you create a table and specify the number of columns, Typst will make
each column large enough to fit its largest cell. Often, you want
something different, for example, to make a table span the whole width
of the page. You can provide a list, specifying how wide you want each
column to be, through the \texttt{\ columns\ } argument. There are a few
different ways to specify column widths:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  First, there is \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ auto\ }}\texttt{\ } . This is
  the default behavior and tells Typst to grow the column to fit its
  contents. If there is not enough space, Typst will try its best to
  distribute the space among the
  \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ auto\ }}\texttt{\ } -sized columns.
\item
  \href{/docs/reference/layout/length/}{Lengths} like
  \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 6cm\ }}\texttt{\ } ,
  \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 0.7in\ }}\texttt{\ } , or
  \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 120pt\ }}\texttt{\ } . As usual, you can also
  use the font-dependent \texttt{\ em\ } unit. This is a multiple of
  your current font size. It\textquotesingle s useful if you want to
  size your table so that it always fits about the same amount of text,
  independent of font size.
\item
  A \href{/docs/reference/layout/ratio/}{ratio in percent} such as
  \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 40\%\ }}\texttt{\ } . This will make the column
  take up 40\% of the total horizontal space available to the table, so
  either the inner width of the page or the table\textquotesingle s
  container. You can also mix ratios and lengths into
  \href{/docs/reference/layout/relative/}{relative lengths} . Be mindful
  that even if you specify a list of column widths that sum up to 100\%,
  your table could still become larger than its container. This is
  because there can be
  \href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#parameters-gutter}{gutter} between
  columns that is not included in the column widths. If you want to make
  a table fill the page, the next option is often very useful.
\item
  A \href{/docs/reference/layout/fraction/}{fractional part of the free
  space} using the \texttt{\ fr\ } unit, such as \texttt{\ 1fr\ } . This
  unit allows you to distribute the available space to columns. It works
  as follows: First, Typst sums up the lengths of all columns that do
  not use \texttt{\ fr\ } s. Then, it determines how much horizontal
  space is left. This horizontal space then gets distributed to all
  columns denominated in \texttt{\ fr\ } s. During this process, a
  \texttt{\ 2fr\ } column will become twice as wide as a
  \texttt{\ 1fr\ } column. This is where the name comes from: The width
  of the column is its fraction of the total fractionally sized columns.
\end{itemize}

Let\textquotesingle s put this to use with a table that contains the
dates, numbers, and descriptions of some routine checks. The first two
columns are \texttt{\ auto\ } -sized and the last column is
\texttt{\ 1fr\ } wide as to fill the whole page.

\begin{verbatim}
#table(
  columns: (auto, auto, 1fr),
  table.header[Date][Â°No][Description],
  [24/01/03], [813], [Filtered participant pool],
  [24/01/03], [477], [Transitioned to sec. regimen],
  [24/01/11], [051], [Cycled treatment substrate],
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/2U_qe89XvypLADel8g81vgAAAAAAAAAA.png}

Here, we have passed our list of column lengths as an
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/array/}{array} , enclosed in round
parentheses, with its elements separated by commas. The first two
columns are automatically sized, so that they take on the size of their
content and the third column is sized as
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 1fr\ }}\texttt{\ } so that it fills up the
remainder of the space on the page. If you wanted to instead change the
second column to be a bit more spacious, you could replace its entry in
the \texttt{\ columns\ } array with a value like
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 6em\ }}\texttt{\ } .

\subsection{How to caption and reference my
table?}\label{captions-and-references}

A table is just as valuable as the information your readers draw from
it. You can enhance the effectiveness of both your prose and your table
by making a clear connection between the two with a cross-reference.
Typst can help you with automatic
\href{/docs/reference/model/ref/}{references} and the
\href{/docs/reference/model/figure/}{\texttt{\ figure\ } function} .

Just like with images, wrapping a table in the \texttt{\ figure\ }
function allows you to add a caption and a label, so you can reference
the figure elsewhere. Wrapping your table in a figure also lets you use
the figure\textquotesingle s \texttt{\ placement\ } parameter to float
it to the top or bottom of a page.

Let\textquotesingle s take a look at a captioned table and how to
reference it in prose:

\begin{verbatim}
#show table.cell.where(y: 0): set text(weight: "bold")

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 4,
    stroke: none,

    table.header[Test Item][Specification][Test Result][Compliance],
    [Voltage], [220V Â± 5%], [218V], [Pass],
    [Current], [5A Â± 0.5A], [4.2A], [Fail],
  ),
  caption: [Probe results for design A],
) <probe-a>

The results from @probe-a show that the design is not yet optimal.
We will show how its performance can be improved in this section.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=8.27083in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/q8w9c3xaiqkQD9Ab1PAe6AAAAAAAAAAA.png}

The example shows how to wrap a table in a figure, set a caption and a
label, and how to reference that label. We start by using the
\texttt{\ figure\ } function. It expects the contents of the figure as a
positional argument. We just put the table function call in its argument
list, omitting the \texttt{\ \#\ } character because it is only needed
when calling a function in markup mode. We also add the caption as a
named argument (above or below) the table.

After the figure call, we put a label in angle brackets (
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \textless{}probe-a\textgreater{}\ }}\texttt{\ } ).
This tells Typst to remember this element and make it referenceable
under this name throughout your document. We can then reference it in
prose by using the at sign and the label name
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ @probe-a\ }}\texttt{\ } . Typst will print a
nicely formatted reference and automatically update the label if the
table\textquotesingle s number changes.

\subsection{How to get a striped table?}\label{fills}

Many tables use striped rows or columns instead of strokes to
differentiate between rows and columns. This effect is often called
\emph{zebra stripes.} Tables with zebra stripes are popular in Business
and commercial Data Analytics applications, while academic applications
tend to use strokes instead.

To add zebra stripes to a table, we use the \texttt{\ table\ }
function\textquotesingle s \texttt{\ fill\ } argument. It can take three
kinds of arguments:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A single color (this can also be a gradient or a pattern) to fill all
  cells with. Because we want some cells to have another color, this is
  not useful if we want to build zebra tables.
\item
  An array with colors which Typst cycles through for each column. We
  can use an array with two elements to get striped columns.
\item
  A function that takes the horizontal coordinate \texttt{\ x\ } and the
  vertical coordinate \texttt{\ y\ } of a cell and returns its fill. We
  can use this to create horizontal stripes or
  \href{/docs/reference/layout/grid/\#definitions-cell}{checkerboard
  patterns} .
\end{itemize}

Let\textquotesingle s start with an example of a horizontally striped
table:

\begin{verbatim}
#set text(font: "IBM Plex Sans")

// Medium bold table header.
#show table.cell.where(y: 0): set text(weight: "medium")

// Bold titles.
#show table.cell.where(x: 1): set text(weight: "bold")

// See the strokes section for details on this!
#let frame(stroke) = (x, y) => (
  left: if x > 0 { 0pt } else { stroke },
  right: stroke,
  top: if y < 2 { stroke } else { 0pt },
  bottom: stroke,
)

#set table(
  fill: (rgb("EAF2F5"), none),
  stroke: frame(rgb("21222C")),
)

#table(
  columns: (0.4fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr),

  table.header[Month][Title][Author][Genre],
  [January], [The Great Gatsby], [F. Scott Fitzgerald], [Classic],
  [February], [To Kill a Mockingbird], [Harper Lee], [Drama],
  [March], [1984], [George Orwell], [Dystopian],
  [April], [The Catcher in the Rye], [J.D. Salinger], [Coming-of-Age],
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=9.44792in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/UJoXkTjV0r6grf2p2oGJMAAAAAAAAAAA.png}

This example shows a book club reading list. The line
\texttt{\ fill:\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ rgb\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "EAF2F5"\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ ,\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ none\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }
in \texttt{\ table\ } \textquotesingle s set rule is all that is needed
to add striped columns. It tells Typst to alternate between coloring
columns with a light blue (in the
\href{/docs/reference/visualize/color/\#definitions-rgb}{\texttt{\ rgb\ }}
function call) and nothing ( \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ none\ }}\texttt{\ }
). Note that we extracted all of our styling from the \texttt{\ table\ }
function call itself into set and show rules, so that we can
automatically reuse it for multiple tables.

Because setting the stripes itself is easy we also added some other
styles to make it look nice. The other code in the example provides a
dark blue \hyperref[stroke-functions]{stroke} around the table and below
the first line and emboldens the first row and the column with the book
title. See the \hyperref[strokes]{strokes} section for details on how we
achieved this stroke configuration.

Let\textquotesingle s next take a look at how we can change only the set
rule to achieve horizontal stripes instead:

\begin{verbatim}
#set table(
  fill: (_, y) => if calc.odd(y) { rgb("EAF2F5") },
  stroke: frame(rgb("21222C")),
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=9.44792in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/25lCWRlQDgNwC6P_ss5rsgAAAAAAAAAA.png}

We just need to replace the set rule from the previous example with this
one and get horizontal stripes instead. Here, we are passing a function
to \texttt{\ fill\ } . It discards the horizontal coordinate with an
underscore and then checks if the vertical coordinate \texttt{\ y\ } of
the cell is odd. If so, the cell gets a light blue fill, otherwise, no
fill is returned.

Of course, you can make this function arbitrarily complex. For example,
if you want to stripe the rows with a light and darker shade of blue,
you could do something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
#set table(
  fill: (_, y) => (none, rgb("EAF2F5"), rgb("DDEAEF")).at(calc.rem(y, 3)),
  stroke: frame(rgb("21222C")),
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=9.44792in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/cCvrBfZ8ZZjy8abtCE_cmgAAAAAAAAAA.png}

This example shows an alternative approach to write our fill function.
The function uses an array with three colors and then cycles between its
values for each row by indexing the array with the remainder of
\texttt{\ y\ } divided by 3.

Finally, here is a bonus example that uses the \emph{stroke} to achieve
striped rows:

\begin{verbatim}
#set table(
  stroke: (x, y) => (
    y: 1pt,
    left: if x > 0 { 0pt } else if calc.even(y) { 1pt },
    right: if calc.even(y) { 1pt },
  ),
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=9.44792in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/GD_bV9_znidgeZ0v5zIXUAAAAAAAAAAA.png}

\subsubsection{Manually overriding a cell\textquotesingle s fill
color}\label{fill-override}

Sometimes, the fill of a cell needs not to vary based on its position in
the table, but rather based on its contents. We can use the
\href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#definitions-cell}{\texttt{\ table.cell\ }
element} in the \texttt{\ table\ } \textquotesingle s parameter list to
wrap a cell\textquotesingle s content and override its fill.

For example, here is a list of all German presidents, with the cell
borders colored in the color of their party.

\begin{verbatim}
#set text(font: "Roboto")

#let cdu(name) = ([CDU], table.cell(fill: black, text(fill: white, name)))
#let spd(name) = ([SPD], table.cell(fill: red, text(fill: white, name)))
#let fdp(name) = ([FDP], table.cell(fill: yellow, name))

#table(
  columns: (auto, auto, 1fr),
  stroke: (x: none),

  table.header[Tenure][Party][President],
  [1949-1959], ..fdp[Theodor Heuss],
  [1959-1969], ..cdu[Heinrich LÃ¼bke],
  [1969-1974], ..spd[Gustav Heinemann],
  [1974-1979], ..fdp[Walter Scheel],
  [1979-1984], ..cdu[Karl Carstens],
  [1984-1994], ..cdu[Richard von WeizsÃ¤cker],
  [1994-1999], ..cdu[Roman Herzog],
  [1999-2004], ..spd[Johannes Rau],
  [2004-2010], ..cdu[Horst KÃ¶hler],
  [2010-2012], ..cdu[Christian Wulff],
  [2012-2017], [n/a], [Joachim Gauck],
  [2017-],     ..spd[Frank-Walter-Steinmeier],
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5.90625in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/Kc5oSTV9kIbzwSd275OEwQAAAAAAAAAA.png}

In this example, we make use of variables because there only have been a
total of three parties whose members have become president (and one
unaffiliated president). Their colors will repeat multiple times, so we
store a function that produces an array with their
party\textquotesingle s name and a table cell with that
party\textquotesingle s color and the president\textquotesingle s name (
\texttt{\ cdu\ } , \texttt{\ spd\ } , and \texttt{\ fdp\ } ). We then
use these functions in the \texttt{\ table\ } argument list instead of
directly adding the name. We use the
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/arguments/\#spreading}{spread
operator} \texttt{\ ..\ } to turn the items of the arrays into single
cells. We could also write something like
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ {[}\ }}\texttt{\ FDP\ }{\texttt{\ {]}\ }}\texttt{\ ,\ table\ }{\texttt{\ .\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ cell\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ fill\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ yellow\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ {[}\ }}\texttt{\ Theodor\ Heuss\ }{\texttt{\ {]}\ }}\texttt{\ }
for each cell directly in the \texttt{\ table\ } \textquotesingle s
argument list, but that becomes unreadable, especially for the parties
whose colors are dark so that they require white text. We also delete
vertical strokes and set the font to Roboto.

The party column and the cell color in this example communicate
redundant information on purpose: Communicating important data using
color only is a bad accessibility practice. It disadvantages users with
vision impairment and is in violation of universal access standards,
such as the
\href{https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html}{WCAG
2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.1} . To improve this table, we added a column
printing the party name. Alternatively, you could have made sure to
choose a color-blindness friendly palette and mark up your cells with an
additional label that screen readers can read out loud. The latter
feature is not currently supported by Typst, but will be added in a
future release. You can check how colors look for color-blind readers
with
\href{https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colorblindly/floniaahmccleoclneebhhmnjgdfijgg}{this
Chrome extension} ,
\href{https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/proofing-colors.html}{Photoshop}
, or
\href{https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-display-filter-dialog.html}{GIMP}
.

\subsection{How to adjust the lines in a table?}\label{strokes}

By default, Typst adds strokes between each row and column of a table.
You can adjust these strokes in a variety of ways. Which one is the most
practical, depends on the modification you want to make and your intent:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Do you want to style all tables in your document, irrespective of
  their size and content? Use the \texttt{\ table\ }
  function\textquotesingle s
  \href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#parameters-stroke}{stroke}
  argument in a set rule.
\item
  Do you want to customize all lines in a single table? Use the
  \texttt{\ table\ } function\textquotesingle s
  \href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#parameters-stroke}{stroke}
  argument when calling the table function.
\item
  Do you want to change, add, or remove the stroke around a single cell?
  Use the \texttt{\ table.cell\ } element in the argument list of your
  table call.
\item
  Do you want to change, add, or remove a single horizontal or vertical
  stroke in a single table? Use the
  \href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#definitions-hline}{\texttt{\ table.hline\ }}
  and
  \href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#definitions-vline}{\texttt{\ table.vline\ }}
  elements in the argument list of your table call.
\end{itemize}

We will go over all of these options with examples next! First, we will
tackle the \texttt{\ table\ } function\textquotesingle s
\href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#parameters-stroke}{stroke} argument.
Here, you can adjust both how the table\textquotesingle s lines get
drawn and configure which lines are drawn at all.

Let\textquotesingle s start by modifying the color and thickness of the
stroke:

\begin{verbatim}
#table(
  columns: 4,
  stroke: 0.5pt + rgb("666675"),
  [*Monday*], [11.5], [13.0], [4.0],
  [*Tuesday*], [8.0], [14.5], [5.0],
  [*Wednesday*], [9.0], [18.5], [13.0],
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/y0uGf9aX-aUGWqCKMwHEJwAAAAAAAAAA.png}

This makes the table lines a bit less wide and uses a bluish gray. You
can see that we added a width in point to a color to achieve our
customized stroke. This addition yields a value of the
\href{/docs/reference/visualize/stroke/}{stroke type} . Alternatively,
you can use the dictionary representation for strokes which allows you
to access advanced features such as dashed lines.

The previous example showed how to use the stroke argument in the table
function\textquotesingle s invocation. Alternatively, you can specify
the stroke argument in the \texttt{\ table\ } \textquotesingle s set
rule. This will have exactly the same effect on all subsequent
\texttt{\ table\ } calls as if the stroke argument was specified in the
argument list. This is useful if you are writing a template or want to
style your whole document.

\begin{verbatim}
// Renders the exact same as the last example
#set table(stroke: 0.5pt + rgb("666675"))

#table(
  columns: 4,
  [*Monday*], [11.5], [13.0], [4.0],
  [*Tuesday*], [8.0], [14.5], [5.0],
  [*Wednesday*], [9.0], [18.5], [13.0],
)
\end{verbatim}

For small tables, you sometimes want to suppress all strokes because
they add too much visual noise. To do this, just set the stroke argument
to \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ none\ }}\texttt{\ } :

\begin{verbatim}
#table(
  columns: 4,
  stroke: none,
  [*Monday*], [11.5], [13.0], [4.0],
  [*Tuesday*], [8.0], [14.5], [5.0],
  [*Wednesday*], [9.0], [18.5], [13.0],
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/vQmODupZkk6MbI3nByjkqwAAAAAAAAAA.png}

If you want more fine-grained control of where lines get placed in your
table, you can also pass a dictionary with the keys \texttt{\ top\ } ,
\texttt{\ left\ } , \texttt{\ right\ } , \texttt{\ bottom\ }
(controlling the respective cell sides), \texttt{\ x\ } , \texttt{\ y\ }
(controlling vertical and horizontal strokes), and \texttt{\ rest\ }
(covers all strokes not styled by other dictionary entries). All keys
are optional; omitted keys will be treated as if their value was the
default value. For example, to get a table with only horizontal lines,
you can do this:

\begin{verbatim}
#table(
  columns: 2,
  stroke: (x: none),
  align: horizon,
  [â], [Close cabin door],
  [â], [Start engines],
  [â], [Radio tower],
  [â], [Push back],
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/eb2IfSiEgTxcBIC79R6b-QAAAAAAAAAA.png}

This turns off all vertical strokes and leaves the horizontal strokes in
place. To achieve the reverse effect (only horizontal strokes), set the
stroke argument to
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ y\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ none\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }
instead.

\hyperref[stroke-functions]{Further down in the guide} , we cover how to
use a function in the stroke argument to customize all strokes
individually. This is how you achieve more complex stroking patterns.

\subsubsection{Adding individual lines in the
table}\label{individual-lines}

If you want to add a single horizontal or vertical line in your table,
for example to separate a group of rows, you can use the
\href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#definitions-hline}{\texttt{\ table.hline\ }}
and
\href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#definitions-vline}{\texttt{\ table.vline\ }}
elements for horizontal and vertical lines, respectively. Add them to
the argument list of the \texttt{\ table\ } function just like you would
add individual cells and a header.

Let\textquotesingle s take a look at the following example from the
reference:

\begin{verbatim}
#set table.hline(stroke: 0.6pt)

#table(
  stroke: none,
  columns: (auto, 1fr),
  // Morning schedule abridged.
  [14:00], [Talk: Tracked Layout],
  [15:00], [Talk: Automations],
  [16:00], [Workshop: Tables],
  table.hline(),
  [19:00], [Day 1 Attendee Mixer],
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/3OGDUdhafmvnsbwhpEZnqAAAAAAAAAAA.png}

In this example, you can see that we have placed a call to
\texttt{\ table.hline\ } between the cells, producing a horizontal line
at that spot. We also used a set rule on the element to reduce its
stroke width to make it fit better with the weight of the font.

By default, Typst places horizontal and vertical lines after the current
row or column, depending on their position in the argument list. You can
also manually move them to a different position by adding the
\texttt{\ y\ } (for \texttt{\ hline\ } ) or \texttt{\ x\ } (for
\texttt{\ vline\ } ) argument. For example, the code below would produce
the same result:

\begin{verbatim}
#set table.hline(stroke: 0.6pt)

#table(
  stroke: none,
  columns: (auto, 1fr),
  // Morning schedule abridged.
  table.hline(y: 3),
  [14:00], [Talk: Tracked Layout],
  [15:00], [Talk: Automations],
  [16:00], [Workshop: Tables],
  [19:00], [Day 1 Attendee Mixer],
)
\end{verbatim}

Let\textquotesingle s imagine you are working with a template that shows
none of the table strokes except for one between the first and second
row. Now, since you have one table that also has labels in the first
column, you want to add an extra vertical line to it. However, you do
not want this vertical line to cross into the top row. You can achieve
this with the \texttt{\ start\ } argument:

\begin{verbatim}
// Base template already configured tables, but we need some
// extra configuration for this table.
#{
  set table(align: (x, _) => if x == 0 { left } else { right })
  show table.cell.where(x: 0): smallcaps
  table(
    columns: (auto, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr),
    table.vline(x: 1, start: 1),
    table.header[Trainset][Top Speed][Length][Weight],
    [TGV RÃ©seau], [320 km/h], [200m], [383t],
    [ICE 403], [330 km/h], [201m], [409t],
    [Shinkansen N700], [300 km/h], [405m], [700t],
  )
}
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=7.08333in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/LINgvIDoMEPxmydMRnWXAgAAAAAAAAAA.png}

In this example, we have added \texttt{\ table.vline\ } at the start of
our positional argument list. But because the line is not supposed to go
to the left of the first column, we specified the \texttt{\ x\ }
argument as \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 1\ }}\texttt{\ } . We also set the
\texttt{\ start\ } argument to \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 1\ }}\texttt{\ } so
that the line does only start after the first row.

The example also contains two more things: We use the align argument
with a function to right-align the data in all but the first column and
use a show rule to make the first column of table cells appear in small
capitals. Because these styles are specific to this one table, we put
everything into a \href{/docs/reference/scripting/\#blocks}{code block}
, so that the styling does not affect any further tables.

\subsubsection{Overriding the strokes of a single
cell}\label{stroke-override}

Imagine you want to change the stroke around a single cell. Maybe your
cell is very important and needs highlighting! For this scenario, there
is the
\href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#definitions-cell}{\texttt{\ table.cell\ }
function} . Instead of adding your content directly in the argument list
of the table, you wrap it in a \texttt{\ table.cell\ } call. Now, you
can use \texttt{\ table.cell\ } \textquotesingle s argument list to
override the table properties, such as the stroke, for this cell only.

Here\textquotesingle s an example with a matrix of two of the Big Five
personality factors, with one intersection highlighted.

\begin{verbatim}
#table(
  columns: 3,
  stroke: (x: none),

  [], [*High Neuroticism*], [*Low Neuroticism*],

  [*High Agreeableness*],
  table.cell(stroke: orange + 2pt)[
    _Sensitive_ \ Prone to emotional distress but very empathetic.
  ],
  [_Compassionate_ \ Caring and stable, often seen as a supportive figure.],

  [*Low Agreeableness*],
  [_Contentious_ \ Competitive and easily agitated.],
  [_Detached_ \ Independent and calm, may appear aloof.],
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=9.44792in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/zT-rPhodrO99vfmjEknOKwAAAAAAAAAA.png}

Above, you can see that we used the \texttt{\ table.cell\ } element in
the table\textquotesingle s argument list and passed the cell content to
it. We have used its \texttt{\ stroke\ } argument to set a wider orange
stroke. Despite the fact that we disabled vertical strokes on the table,
the orange stroke appeared on all sides of the modified cell, showing
that the table\textquotesingle s stroke configuration is overwritten.

\subsubsection{Complex document-wide stroke
customization}\label{stroke-functions}

This section explains how to customize all lines at once in one or
multiple tables. This allows you to draw only the first horizontal line
or omit the outer lines, without knowing how many cells the table has.
This is achieved by providing a function to the table\textquotesingle s
\texttt{\ stroke\ } parameter. The function should return a stroke given
the zero-indexed x and y position of the current cell. You should only
need these functions if you are a template author, do not use a
template, or need to heavily customize your tables. Otherwise, your
template should set appropriate default table strokes.

For example, this is a set rule that draws all horizontal lines except
for the very first and last line.

\begin{verbatim}
#show table.cell.where(x: 0): set text(style: "italic")
#show table.cell.where(y: 0): set text(style: "normal", weight: "bold")
#set table(stroke: (_, y) => if y > 0 { (top: 0.8pt) })

#table(
  columns: 3,
  align: center + horizon,
  table.header[Technique][Advantage][Drawback],
  [Diegetic], [Immersive], [May be contrived],
  [Extradiegetic], [Breaks immersion], [Obtrusive],
  [Omitted], [Fosters engagement], [May fracture audience],
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/SKiPog79AfwUoglArT-17wAAAAAAAAAA.png}

In the set rule, we pass a function that receives two arguments,
assigning the vertical coordinate to \texttt{\ y\ } and discarding the
horizontal coordinate. It then returns a stroke dictionary with a
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 0.8pt\ }}\texttt{\ } top stroke for all but the
first line. The cells in the first line instead implicitly receive
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ none\ }}\texttt{\ } as the return value. You can
easily modify this function to just draw the inner vertical lines
instead as
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ x\ }{\texttt{\ ,\ }}\texttt{\ \_\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ =\textgreater{}\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ if\ }}\texttt{\ x\ }{\texttt{\ \textgreater{}\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 0\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \{\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ left\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 0.8pt\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \}\ }}\texttt{\ }
.

Let\textquotesingle s try a few more stroking functions. The next
function will only draw a line below the first row:

\begin{verbatim}
#set table(stroke: (_, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 1pt) })

// Table as seen above
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/nyvsIK-tDvHuRwbnwhj4kQAAAAAAAAAA.png}

If you understood the first example, it becomes obvious what happens
here. We check if we are in the first row. If so, we return a bottom
stroke. Otherwise, we\textquotesingle ll return
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ none\ }}\texttt{\ } implicitly.

The next example shows how to draw all but the outer lines:

\begin{verbatim}
#set table(stroke: (x, y) => (
  left: if x > 0 { 0.8pt },
  top: if y > 0 { 0.8pt },
))

// Table as seen above
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/QRh4-eyPqD4Yz9VResk9dwAAAAAAAAAA.png}

This example uses both the \texttt{\ x\ } and \texttt{\ y\ }
coordinates. It omits the left stroke in the first column and the top
stroke in the first row. The right and bottom lines are not drawn.

Finally, here is a table that draws all lines except for the vertical
lines in the first row and horizontal lines in the table body. It looks
a bit like a calendar.

\begin{verbatim}
#set table(stroke: (x, y) => (
  left: if x == 0 or y > 0 { 1pt } else {Â 0pt },
  right: 1pt,
  top: if y <= 1 { 1pt } else {Â 0pt },
  bottom: 1pt,
))

// Table as seen above
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/qw8tKe_4tpVbtFAmFf0POQAAAAAAAAAA.png}

This example is a bit more complex. We start by drawing all the strokes
on the right of the cells. But this means that we have drawn strokes in
the top row, too, and we don\textquotesingle t need those! We use the
fact that \texttt{\ left\ } will override \texttt{\ right\ } and only
draw the left line if we are not in the first row or if we are in the
first column. In all other cases, we explicitly remove the left line.
Finally, we draw the horizontal lines by first setting the bottom line
and then for the first two rows with the \texttt{\ top\ } key,
suppressing all other top lines. The last line appears because there is
no \texttt{\ top\ } line that could suppress it.

\subsubsection{How to achieve a double line?}\label{double-stroke}

Typst does not yet have a native way to draw double strokes, but there
are multiple ways to emulate them, for example with
\href{/docs/reference/visualize/pattern/}{patterns} . We will show a
different workaround in this section: Table gutters.

Tables can space their cells apart using the \texttt{\ gutter\ }
argument. When a gutter is applied, a stroke is drawn on each of the now
separated cells. We can selectively add gutter between the rows or
columns for which we want to draw a double line. The
\texttt{\ row-gutter\ } and \texttt{\ column-gutter\ } arguments allow
us to do this. They accept arrays of gutter values.
Let\textquotesingle s take a look at an example:

\begin{verbatim}
#table(
  columns: 3,
  stroke: (x: none),
  row-gutter: (2.2pt, auto),
  table.header[Date][Exercise Type][Calories Burned],
  [2023-03-15], [Swimming], [400],
  [2023-03-17], [Weightlifting], [250],
  [2023-03-18], [Yoga], [200],
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/ketpWMF_8TQEKQlrbhiNRQAAAAAAAAAA.png}

We can see that we used an array for \texttt{\ row-gutter\ } that
specifies a \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 2.2pt\ }}\texttt{\ } gap between the
first and second row. It then continues with \texttt{\ auto\ } (which is
the default, in this case \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 0pt\ }}\texttt{\ }
gutter) which will be the gutter between all other rows, since it is the
last entry in the array.

\subsection{How to align the contents of the cells in my
table?}\label{alignment}

You can use multiple mechanisms to align the content in your table. You
can either use the \texttt{\ table\ } function\textquotesingle s
\texttt{\ align\ } argument to set the alignment for your whole table
(or use it in a set rule to set the alignment for tables throughout your
document) or the
\href{/docs/reference/layout/align/}{\texttt{\ align\ }} function (or
\texttt{\ table.cell\ } \textquotesingle s \texttt{\ align\ } argument)
to override the alignment of a single cell.

When using the \texttt{\ table\ } function\textquotesingle s align
argument, you can choose between three methods to specify an
\href{/docs/reference/layout/alignment/}{alignment} :

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Just specify a single alignment like \texttt{\ right\ } (aligns in the
  top-right corner) or \texttt{\ center\ +\ horizon\ } (centers all cell
  content). This changes the alignment of all cells.
\item
  Provide an array. Typst will cycle through this array for each column.
\item
  Provide a function that is passed the horizontal \texttt{\ x\ } and
  vertical \texttt{\ y\ } coordinate of a cell and returns an alignment.
\end{itemize}

For example, this travel itinerary right-aligns the day column and
left-aligns everything else by providing an array in the
\texttt{\ align\ } argument:

\begin{verbatim}
#set text(font: "IBM Plex Sans")
#show table.cell.where(y: 0): set text(weight: "bold")

#table(
  columns: 4,
  align: (right, left, left, left),
  fill: (_, y) => if calc.odd(y) { green.lighten(90%) },
  stroke: none,

  table.header[Day][Location][Hotel or Apartment][Activities],
  [1], [Paris, France], [Hotel de L'Europe], [Arrival, Evening River Cruise],
  [2], [Paris, France], [Hotel de L'Europe], [Louvre Museum, Eiffel Tower],
  [3], [Lyon, France], [Lyon City Hotel], [City Tour, Local Cuisine Tasting],
  [4], [Geneva, Switzerland], [Lakeview Inn], [Lake Geneva, Red Cross Museum],
  [5], [Zermatt, Switzerland], [Alpine Lodge], [Visit Matterhorn, Skiing],
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=7.08333in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/JDfAUmIJzQHzE6NL8LKAnwAAAAAAAAAA.png}

However, this example does not yet look perfect â€'' the header cells
should be bottom-aligned. Let\textquotesingle s use a function instead
to do so:

\begin{verbatim}
#set text(font: "IBM Plex Sans")
#show table.cell.where(y: 0): set text(weight: "bold")

#table(
  columns: 4,
  align: (x, y) =>
    if x == 0 { right } else { left } +
    if y == 0 { bottom } else { top },
  fill: (_, y) => if calc.odd(y) { green.lighten(90%) },
  stroke: none,

  table.header[Day][Location][Hotel or Apartment][Activities],
  [1], [Paris, France], [Hotel de L'Europe], [Arrival, Evening River Cruise],
  [2], [Paris, France], [Hotel de L'Europe], [Louvre Museum, Eiffel Tower],
 // ... remaining days omitted
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=7.08333in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/ENpsdZXkKtSK7dBT6e9dAgAAAAAAAAAA.png}

In the function, we calculate a horizontal and vertical alignment based
on whether we are in the first column (
\texttt{\ x\ }{\texttt{\ ==\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 0\ }}\texttt{\ } )
or the first row (
\texttt{\ y\ }{\texttt{\ ==\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 0\ }}\texttt{\ } ).
We then make use of the fact that we can add horizontal and vertical
alignments with \texttt{\ +\ } to receive a single, two-dimensional
alignment.

You can find an example of using \texttt{\ table.cell\ } to change a
single cell\textquotesingle s alignment on
\href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#definitions-cell}{its reference
page} .

\subsection{How to merge cells?}\label{merge-cells}

When a table contains logical groupings or the same data in multiple
adjacent cells, merging multiple cells into a single, larger cell can be
advantageous. Another use case for cell groups are table headers with
multiple rows: That way, you can group for example a sales data table by
quarter in the first row and by months in the second row.

A merged cell spans multiple rows and/or columns. You can achieve it
with the
\href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#definitions-cell}{\texttt{\ table.cell\ }}
function\textquotesingle s \texttt{\ rowspan\ } and \texttt{\ colspan\ }
arguments: Just specify how many rows or columns you want your cell to
span.

The example below contains an attendance calendar for an office with
in-person and remote days for each team member. To make the table more
glanceable, we merge adjacent cells with the same value:

\begin{verbatim}
#let ofi = [Office]
#let rem = [_Remote_]
#let lea = [*On leave*]

#show table.cell.where(y: 0): set text(
  fill: white,
  weight: "bold",
)

#table(
  columns: 6 * (1fr,),
  align: (x, y) => if x == 0 or y == 0 { left } else { center },
  stroke: (x, y) => (
    // Separate black cells with white strokes.
    left: if y == 0 and x > 0 { white } else { black },
    rest: black,
  ),
  fill: (_, y) => if y == 0 { black },

  table.header(
    [Team member],
    [Monday],
    [Tuesday],
    [Wednesday],
    [Thursday],
    [Friday]
  ),
  [Evelyn Archer],
    table.cell(colspan: 2, ofi),
    table.cell(colspan: 2, rem),
    ofi,
  [Lila Montgomery],
    table.cell(colspan: 5, lea),
  [Nolan Pearce],
    rem,
    table.cell(colspan: 2, ofi),
    rem,
    ofi,
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=12.98958in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/yyaKf-LLQbyy3QccVJXb2wAAAAAAAAAA.png}

In the example, we first define variables with "Office", "Remote", and
"On leave" so we don\textquotesingle t have to write these labels out
every time. We can then use these variables in the table body either
directly or in a \texttt{\ table.cell\ } call if the team member spends
multiple consecutive days in office, remote, or on leave.

The example also contains a black header (created with
\texttt{\ table\ } \textquotesingle s \texttt{\ fill\ } argument) with
white strokes ( \texttt{\ table\ } \textquotesingle s
\texttt{\ stroke\ } argument) and white text (set by the
\texttt{\ table.cell\ } set rule). Finally, we align all the content of
all table cells in the body in the center. If you want to know more
about the functions passed to \texttt{\ align\ } , \texttt{\ stroke\ } ,
and \texttt{\ fill\ } , you can check out the sections on
\href{/docs/reference/layout/alignment/}{alignment} ,
\hyperref[stroke-functions]{strokes} , and \hyperref[fills]{striped
tables} .

This table would be a great candidate for fully automated generation
from an external data source! Check out the
\hyperref[importing-data]{section about importing data} to learn more
about that.

\subsection{How to rotate a table?}\label{rotate-table}

When tables have many columns, a portrait paper orientation can quickly
get cramped. Hence, you\textquotesingle ll sometimes want to switch your
tables to landscape orientation. There are two ways to accomplish this
in Typst:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you want to rotate only the table but not the other content of the
  page and the page itself, use the
  \href{/docs/reference/layout/rotate/}{\texttt{\ rotate\ } function}
  with the \texttt{\ reflow\ } argument set to
  \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ true\ }}\texttt{\ } .
\item
  If you want to rotate the whole page the table is on, you can use the
  \href{/docs/reference/layout/page/}{\texttt{\ page\ } function} with
  its \texttt{\ flipped\ } argument set to
  \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ true\ }}\texttt{\ } . The header, footer, and
  page number will now also appear on the long edge of the page. This
  has the advantage that the table will appear right side up when read
  on a computer, but it also means that a page in your document has
  different dimensions than all the others, which can be jarring to your
  readers.
\end{itemize}

Below, we will demonstrate both techniques with a student grade book
table.

First, we will rotate the table on the page. The example also places
some text on the right of the table.

\begin{verbatim}
#set page("a5", columns: 2, numbering: "â 1 â")
#show table.cell.where(y: 0): set text(weight: "bold")

#rotate(
  -90deg,
  reflow: true,

  table(
    columns: (1fr,) + 5 * (auto,),
    inset: (x: 0.6em,),
    stroke: (_, y) => (
      x: 1pt,
      top: if y <= 1 { 1pt } else {Â 0pt },
      bottom: 1pt,
    ),
    align: (left, right, right, right, right, left),

    table.header(
      [Student Name],
      [Assignment 1], [Assignment 2],
      [Mid-term], [Final Exam],
      [Total Grade],
    ),
    [Jane Smith], [78%], [82%], [75%], [80%], [B],
    [Alex Johnson], [90%], [95%], [94%], [96%], [A+],
    [John Doe], [85%], [90%], [88%], [92%], [A],
    [Maria Garcia], [88%], [84%], [89%], [85%], [B+],
    [Zhang Wei], [93%], [89%], [90%], [91%], [A-],
    [Marina Musterfrau], [96%], [91%], [74%], [69%], [B-],
  ),
)

#lorem(80)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=8.73958in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/t_mhLmSe89ZV_R--e5hFagAAAAAAAAAA.png}

What we have here is a two-column document on ISO A5 paper with page
numbers on the bottom. The table has six columns and contains a few
customizations to \hyperref[strokes]{stroke} , alignment and spacing.
But the most important part is that the table is wrapped in a call to
the \texttt{\ rotate\ } function with the \texttt{\ reflow\ } argument
being \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ true\ }}\texttt{\ } . This will make the
table rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise. The reflow argument is needed
so that the table\textquotesingle s rotation affects the layout. If it
was omitted, Typst would lay out the page as if the table was not
rotated ( \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ true\ }}\texttt{\ } might become the
default in the future).

The example also shows how to produce many columns of the same size: To
the initial \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 1fr\ }}\texttt{\ } column, we add an
array with five \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ auto\ }}\texttt{\ } items that we
create by multiplying an array with one
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ auto\ }}\texttt{\ } item by five. Note that arrays
with just one item need a trailing comma to distinguish them from merely
parenthesized expressions.

The second example shows how to rotate the whole page, so that the table
stays upright:

\begin{verbatim}
#set page("a5", numbering: "â 1 â")
#show table.cell.where(y: 0): set text(weight: "bold")

#page(flipped: true)[
  #table(
    columns: (1fr,) + 5 * (auto,),
    inset: (x: 0.6em,),
    stroke: (_, y) => (
      x: 1pt,
      top: if y <= 1 { 1pt } else {Â 0pt },
      bottom: 1pt,
    ),
    align: (left, right, right, right, right, left),

    table.header(
      [Student Name],
      [Assignment 1], [Assignment 2],
      [Mid-term], [Final Exam],
      [Total Grade],
    ),
    [Jane Smith], [78%], [82%], [75%], [80%], [B],
    [Alex Johnson], [90%], [95%], [94%], [96%], [A+],
    [John Doe], [85%], [90%], [88%], [92%], [A],
    [Maria Garcia], [88%], [84%], [89%], [85%], [B+],
    [Zhang Wei], [93%], [89%], [90%], [91%], [A-],
    [Marina Musterfrau], [96%], [91%], [74%], [69%], [B-],
  )

  #pad(x: 15%, top: 1.5em)[
    = Winter 2023/24 results
    #lorem(80)
  ]
]
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=12.40625in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/9Goo6xTF0vprclhyFSb4zwAAAAAAAAAA.png}

Here, we take the same table and the other content we want to set with
it and put it into a call to the
\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/}{\texttt{\ page\ }} function while
supplying \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ true\ }}\texttt{\ } to the
\texttt{\ flipped\ } argument. This will instruct Typst to create new
pages with width and height swapped and place the contents of the
function call onto a new page. Notice how the page number is also on the
long edge of the paper now. At the bottom of the page, we use the
\href{/docs/reference/layout/pad/}{\texttt{\ pad\ }} function to
constrain the width of the paragraph to achieve a nice and legible line
length.

\subsection{How to break a table across
pages?}\label{table-across-pages}

It is best to contain a table on a single page. However, some tables
just have many rows, so breaking them across pages becomes unavoidable.
Fortunately, Typst supports breaking tables across pages out of the box.
If you are using the
\href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#definitions-header}{\texttt{\ table.header\ }}
and
\href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#definitions-footer}{\texttt{\ table.footer\ }}
functions, their contents will be repeated on each page as the first and
last rows, respectively. If you want to disable this behavior, you can
set \texttt{\ repeat\ } to \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ false\ }}\texttt{\ } on
either of them.

If you have placed your table inside of a
\href{/docs/reference/model/figure/}{figure} , it becomes unable to
break across pages by default. However, you can change this behavior.
Let\textquotesingle s take a look:

\begin{verbatim}
#set page(width: 9cm, height: 6cm)
#show table.cell.where(y: 0): set text(weight: "bold")
#show figure: set block(breakable: true)

#figure(
  caption: [Training regimen for Marathon],
  table(
    columns: 3,
    fill: (_, y) => if y == 0 { gray.lighten(75%) },

A figure automatically produces a
\href{/docs/reference/layout/block/}{block} which cannot break by
default. However, we can reconfigure the block of the figure using a
show rule to make it \texttt{\ breakable\ } . Now, the figure spans
multiple pages with the headers and footers repeating.

\subsection{How to import data into a table?}\label{importing-data}

Often, you need to put data that you obtained elsewhere into a table.
Sometimes, this is from Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, sometimes it
is from a dataset on the web or from your experiment. Fortunately, Typst
can load many \href{/docs/reference/data-loading/}{common file formats}
, so you can use scripting to include their data in a table.

The most common file format for tabular data is CSV. You can obtain a
CSV file from Excel by choosing "Save as" in the \emph{File} menu and
choosing the file format "CSV UTF-8 (Comma-delimited) (.csv)". Save the
file and, if you are using the web app, upload it to your project.

In our case, we will be building a table about Moore\textquotesingle s
Law. For this purpose, we are using a statistic with
\href{https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/transistors-per-microprocessor}{how
many transistors the average microprocessor consists of per year from
Our World in Data} . Let\textquotesingle s start by pressing the
"Download" button to get a CSV file with the raw data.

Be sure to move the file to your project or somewhere Typst can see it,
if you are using the CLI. Once you did that, we can open the file to see
how it is structured:

\begin{verbatim}
Entity,Code,Year,Transistors per microprocessor
World,OWID_WRL,1971,2308.2417
World,OWID_WRL,1972,3554.5222
World,OWID_WRL,1974,6097.5625
\end{verbatim}

The file starts with a header and contains four columns: Entity (which
is to whom the metric applies), Code, the year, and the number of
transistors per microprocessor. Only the last two columns change between
each row, so we can disregard "Entity" and "Code".

First, let\textquotesingle s start by loading this file with the
\href{/docs/reference/data-loading/csv/}{\texttt{\ csv\ }} function. It
accepts the file name of the file we want to load as a string argument:

\begin{verbatim}
#let moore = csv("moore.csv")
\end{verbatim}

We have loaded our file (assuming we named it \texttt{\ moore.csv\ } )
and \href{/docs/reference/scripting/\#bindings}{bound it} to the new
variable \texttt{\ moore\ } . This will not produce any output, so
there\textquotesingle s nothing to see yet. If we want to examine what
Typst loaded, we can either hover the name of the variable in the web
app or print some items from the array:

\begin{verbatim}
#let moore = csv("moore.csv")

#moore.slice(0, 3)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/4Wrq2xnRY1_FUBMwiwPizQAAAAAAAAAA.png}

With the arguments
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 0\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ ,\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 3\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }
, the
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/array/\#definitions-slice}{\texttt{\ slice\ }}
method returns the first three items in the array (with the indices 0,
1, and 2). We can see that each row is its own array with one item per
cell.

Now, let\textquotesingle s write a loop that will transform this data
into an array of cells that we can use with the table function.

\begin{verbatim}
#let moore = csv("moore.csv")

#table(
  columns: 2,
  ..for (.., year, count) in moore {
    (year, count)
  }
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/1JHLF5egGPQD3C2V0wZONgAAAAAAAAAA.png}

The example above uses a for loop that iterates over the rows in our CSV
file and returns an array for each iteration. We use the for
loop\textquotesingle s
\href{/docs/reference/scripting/\#bindings}{destructuring} capability to
discard all but the last two items of each row. We then create a new
array with just these two. Because Typst will concatenate the array
results of all the loop iterations, we get a one-dimensional array in
which the year column and the number of transistors alternate. We can
then insert the array as cells. For this we use the
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/arguments/\#spreading}{spread
operator} ( \texttt{\ ..\ } ). By prefixing an array, or, in our case an
expression that yields an array, with two dots, we tell Typst that the
array\textquotesingle s items should be used as positional arguments.

Alternatively, we can also use the
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/array/\#definitions-map}{\texttt{\ map\ }}
,
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/array/\#definitions-slice}{\texttt{\ slice\ }}
, and
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/array/\#definitions-flatten}{\texttt{\ flatten\ }}
array methods to write this in a more functional style:

\begin{verbatim}
#let moore = csv("moore.csv")

#table(
   columns: moore.first().len(),
   ..moore.map(m => m.slice(2)).flatten(),
)
\end{verbatim}

This example renders the same as the previous one, but first uses the
\texttt{\ map\ } function to change each row of the data. We pass a
function to map that gets run on each row of the CSV and returns a new
value to replace that row with. We use it to discard the first two
columns with \texttt{\ slice\ } . Then, we spread the data into the
\texttt{\ table\ } function. However, we need to pass a one-dimensional
array and \texttt{\ moore\ } \textquotesingle s value is two-dimensional
(that means that each of its row values contains an array with the cell
data). That\textquotesingle s why we call \texttt{\ flatten\ } which
converts it to a one-dimensional array. We also extract the number of
columns from the data itself.

Now that we have nice code for our table, we should try to also make the
table itself nice! The transistor counts go from millions in 1995 to
trillions in 2021 and changes are difficult to see with so many digits.
We could try to present our data logarithmically to make it more
digestible:

\begin{verbatim}
#let moore = csv("moore.csv")
#let moore-log = moore.slice(1).map(m => {
  let (.., year, count) = m
  let log = calc.log(float(count))
  let rounded = str(calc.round(log, digits: 2))
  (year, rounded)
})

#show table.cell.where(x: 0): strong

#table(
   columns: moore-log.first().len(),
   align: right,
   fill: (_, y) => if calc.odd(y) { rgb("D7D9E0") },
   stroke: none,

   table.header[Year][Transistor count ($log_10$)],
   table.hline(stroke: rgb("4D4C5B")),
   ..moore-log.flatten(),
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/ZOXJwHX6lPP_GLnz4eAxbQAAAAAAAAAA.png}

In this example, we first drop the header row from the data since we are
adding our own. Then, we discard all but the last two columns as above.
We do this by \href{/docs/reference/scripting/\#bindings}{destructuring}
the array \texttt{\ m\ } , discarding all but the two last items. We
then convert the string in \texttt{\ count\ } to a floating point
number, calculate its logarithm and store it in the variable
\texttt{\ log\ } . Finally, we round it to two digits, convert it to a
string, and store it in the variable \texttt{\ rounded\ } . Then, we
return an array with \texttt{\ year\ } and \texttt{\ rounded\ } that
replaces the original row. In our table, we have added our custom header
that tells the reader that we\textquotesingle ve applied a logarithm to
the values. Then, we spread the flattened data as above.

We also styled the table with \hyperref[fills]{stripes} , a
\hyperref[individual-lines]{horizontal line} below the first row,
\hyperref[alignment]{aligned} everything to the right, and emboldened
the first column. Click on the links to go to the relevant guide
sections and see how it\textquotesingle s done!

\subsection{What if I need the table function for something that
isn\textquotesingle t a table?}\label{table-and-grid}

Tabular layouts of content can be useful not only for matrices of
closely related data, like shown in the examples throughout this guide,
but also for presentational purposes. Typst differentiates between grids
that are for layout and presentational purposes only and tables, in
which the arrangement of the cells itself conveys information.

To make this difference clear to other software and allow templates to
heavily style tables, Typst has two functions for grid and table layout:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \href{/docs/reference/model/table/}{\texttt{\ table\ }} function
  explained throughout this guide which is intended for tabular data.
\item
  The \href{/docs/reference/layout/grid/}{\texttt{\ grid\ }} function
  which is intended for presentational purposes and page layout.
\end{itemize}

Both elements work the same way and have the same arguments. You can
apply everything you have learned about tables in this guide to grids.
There are only three differences:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You\textquotesingle ll need to use the
  \href{/docs/reference/layout/grid/\#definitions-cell}{\texttt{\ grid.cell\ }}
  ,
  \href{/docs/reference/layout/grid/\#definitions-vline}{\texttt{\ grid.vline\ }}
  , and
  \href{/docs/reference/layout/grid/\#definitions-hline}{\texttt{\ grid.hline\ }}
  elements instead of
  \href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#definitions-cell}{\texttt{\ table.cell\ }}
  ,
  \href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#definitions-vline}{\texttt{\ table.vline\ }}
  , and
  \href{/docs/reference/model/table/\#definitions-hline}{\texttt{\ table.hline\ }}
  .
\item
  The grid has different defaults: It draws no strokes by default and
  has no spacing ( \texttt{\ inset\ } ) inside of its cells.
\item
  Elements like \texttt{\ figure\ } do not react to grids since they are
  supposed to have no semantical bearing on the document structure.
\end{itemize}

\section{Page setup guide}\label{page-setup-guide}

Your page setup is a big part of the first impression your document
gives. Line lengths, margins, and columns influence
\href{https://practicaltypography.com/page-margins.html}{appearance} and
\href{https://designregression.com/article/line-length-revisited-following-the-research}{legibility}
while the right headers and footers will help your reader easily
navigate your document. This guide will help you to customize pages,
margins, headers, footers, and page numbers so that they are the right
fit for your content and you can get started with writing.

In Typst, each page has a width, a height, and margins on all four
sides. The top and bottom margins may contain a header and footer. The
set rule of the \href{/docs/reference/layout/page/}{\texttt{\ page\ }}
element is where you control all of the page setup. If you make changes
with this set rule, Typst will ensure that there is a new and conforming
empty page afterward, so it may insert a page break. Therefore, it is
best to specify your
\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/}{\texttt{\ page\ }} set rule at the
start of your document or in your template.

\begin{verbatim}
#set rect(
  width: 100%,
  height: 100%,
  inset: 4pt,
)

#set page(
  paper: "iso-b7",
  header: rect(fill: aqua)[Header],
  footer: rect(fill: aqua)[Footer],
  number-align: center,
)

#rect(fill: aqua.lighten(40%))
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5.19792in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/f-lyLMO5vdXuAMoj28s3AgAAAAAAAAAA.png}

This example visualizes the dimensions for page content, headers, and
footers. The page content is the page size (ISO B7) minus each
side\textquotesingle s default margin. In the top and the bottom margin,
there are stroked rectangles visualizing the header and footer. They do
not touch the main content, instead, they are offset by 30\% of the
respective margin. You can control this offset by specifying the
\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/\#parameters-header-ascent}{\texttt{\ header-ascent\ }}
and
\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/\#parameters-footer-descent}{\texttt{\ footer-descent\ }}
arguments.

Below, the guide will go more into detail on how to accomplish common
page setup requirements with examples.

\subsection{Customize page size and margins}\label{customize-margins}

Typst\textquotesingle s default page size is A4 paper. Depending on your
region and your use case, you will want to change this. You can do this
by using the \href{/docs/reference/layout/page/}{\texttt{\ page\ }} set
rule and passing it a string argument to use a common page size. Options
include the complete ISO 216 series (e.g. \texttt{\ "iso-a4"\ } ,
\texttt{\ "iso-c2"\ } ), customary US formats like
\texttt{\ "us-legal"\ } or \texttt{\ "us-letter"\ } , and more. Check
out the reference for the
\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/\#parameters-paper}{page\textquotesingle s
paper argument} to learn about all available options.

\begin{verbatim}
#set page("us-letter")

This page likes freedom.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=12.75in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/Qkb9fYb5SMfDaJ63aYycTwAAAAAAAAAA.png}

If you need to customize your page size to some dimensions, you can
specify the named arguments
\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/\#parameters-width}{\texttt{\ width\ }}
and
\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/\#parameters-height}{\texttt{\ height\ }}
instead.

\begin{verbatim}
#set page(width: 12cm, height: 12cm)

This page is a square.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=7.08333in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/RltrP5jjKi_qENhy9B-HyQAAAAAAAAAA.png}

\subsubsection{Change the page\textquotesingle s
margins}\label{change-margins}

Margins are a vital ingredient for good typography:
\href{http://webtypography.net/2.1.2}{Typographers consider lines that
fit between 45 and 75 characters best length for legibility} and your
margins and \hyperref[columns]{columns} help define line widths. By
default, Typst will create margins proportional to the page size of your
document. To set custom margins, you will use the
\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/\#parameters-margin}{\texttt{\ margin\ }}
argument in the \href{/docs/reference/layout/page/}{\texttt{\ page\ }}
set rule.

The \texttt{\ margin\ } argument will accept a length if you want to set
all margins to the same width. However, you often want to set different
margins on each side. To do this, you can pass a dictionary:

\begin{verbatim}
#set page(margin: (
  top: 3cm,
  bottom: 2cm,
  x: 1.5cm,
))

#lorem(100)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/yJb2DmVYA18DCHWDRA50QQAAAAAAAAAA.png}

The page margin dictionary can have keys for each side (
\texttt{\ top\ } , \texttt{\ bottom\ } , \texttt{\ left\ } ,
\texttt{\ right\ } ), but you can also control left and right together
by setting the \texttt{\ x\ } key of the margin dictionary, like in the
example. Likewise, the top and bottom margins can be adjusted together
by setting the \texttt{\ y\ } key.

If you do not specify margins for all sides in the margin dictionary,
the old margins will remain in effect for the unset sides. To prevent
this and set all remaining margins to a common size, you can use the
\texttt{\ rest\ } key. For example,
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ set\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ page\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ margin\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ left\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 1.5in\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ ,\ }}\texttt{\ rest\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 1in\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }
will set the left margin to 1.5 inches and the remaining margins to one
inch.

\subsubsection{Different margins on alternating
pages}\label{alternating-margins}

Sometimes, you\textquotesingle ll need to alternate horizontal margins
for even and odd pages, for example, to have more room towards the spine
of a book than on the outsides of its pages. Typst keeps track of
whether a page is to the left or right of the binding. You can use this
information and set the \texttt{\ inside\ } or \texttt{\ outside\ } keys
of the margin dictionary. The \texttt{\ inside\ } margin points towards
the spine, and the \texttt{\ outside\ } margin points towards the edge
of the bound book.

\begin{verbatim}
#set page(margin: (inside: 2.5cm, outside: 2cm, y: 1.75cm))
\end{verbatim}

Typst will assume that documents written in Left-to-Right scripts are
bound on the left while books written in Right-to-Left scripts are bound
on the right. However, you will need to change this in some cases: If
your first page is output by a different app, the binding is reversed
from Typst\textquotesingle s perspective. Also, some books, like
English-language Mangas are customarily bound on the right, despite
English using Left-to-Right script. To change the binding side and
explicitly set where the \texttt{\ inside\ } and \texttt{\ outside\ }
are, set the
\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/\#parameters-binding}{\texttt{\ binding\ }}
argument in the \href{/docs/reference/layout/page/}{\texttt{\ page\ }}
set rule.

\begin{verbatim}
// Produce a book bound on the right,
// even though it is set in Spanish.
#set text(lang: "es")
#set page(binding: right)
\end{verbatim}

If \texttt{\ binding\ } is \texttt{\ left\ } , \texttt{\ inside\ }
margins will be on the left on odd pages, and vice versa.

\subsection{Add headers and footers}\label{headers-and-footers}

Headers and footers are inserted in the top and bottom margins of every
page. You can add custom headers and footers or just insert a page
number.

In case you need more than just a page number, the best way to insert a
header and a footer are the
\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/\#parameters-header}{\texttt{\ header\ }}
and
\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/\#parameters-footer}{\texttt{\ footer\ }}
arguments of the \href{/docs/reference/layout/page/}{\texttt{\ page\ }}
set rule. You can pass any content as their values:

\begin{verbatim}
#set page(header: [
  _Lisa Strassner's Thesis_
  #h(1fr)
  National Academy of Sciences
])

#lorem(150)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=8.73958in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/8IFKrlz4CTSpYgWgKq02tAAAAAAAAAAA.png}

Headers are bottom-aligned by default so that they do not collide with
the top edge of the page. You can change this by wrapping your header in
the \href{/docs/reference/layout/align/}{\texttt{\ align\ }} function.

\subsubsection{Different header and footer on specific
pages}\label{specific-pages}

You\textquotesingle ll need different headers and footers on some pages.
For example, you may not want a header and footer on the title page. The
example below shows how to conditionally remove the header on the first
page:

\begin{verbatim}
#set page(header: context {
  if counter(page).get().first() > 1 [
    _Lisa Strassner's Thesis_
    #h(1fr)
    National Academy of Sciences
  ]
})

#lorem(150)
\end{verbatim}

This example may look intimidating, but let\textquotesingle s break it
down: By using the \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ context\ }}\texttt{\ } keyword,
we are telling Typst that the header depends on where we are in the
document. We then ask Typst if the page
\href{/docs/reference/introspection/counter/}{counter} is larger than
one at our (context-dependent) current position. The page counter starts
at one, so we are skipping the header on a single page. Counters may
have multiple levels. This feature is used for items like headings, but
the page counter will always have a single level, so we can just look at
the first one.

You can, of course, add an \texttt{\ else\ } to this example to add a
different header to the first page instead.

\subsubsection{Adapt headers and footers on pages with specific
elements}\label{specific-elements}

The technique described in the previous section can be adapted to
perform more advanced tasks using Typst\textquotesingle s labels. For
example, pages with big tables could omit their headers to help keep
clutter down. We will mark our tables with a
\texttt{\ \textless{}big-table\textgreater{}\ }
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/label/}{label} and use the
\href{/docs/reference/introspection/query/}{query system} to find out if
such a label exists on the current page:

\begin{verbatim}
#set page(header: context {
  let page-counter =
  let matches = query(<big-table>)
  let current = counter(page).get()
  let has-table = matches.any(m =>
    counter(page).at(m.location()) == current
  )

  if not has-table [
    _Lisa Strassner's Thesis_
    #h(1fr)
    National Academy of Sciences
  ]
}))

#lorem(100)
#pagebreak()

#table(
  columns: 2 * (1fr,),
  [A], [B],
  [C], [D],
) <big-table>
\end{verbatim}

Here, we query for all instances of the
\texttt{\ \textless{}big-table\textgreater{}\ } label. We then check
that none of the tables are on the page at our current position. If so,
we print the header. This example also uses variables to be more
concise. Just as above, you could add an \texttt{\ else\ } to add
another header instead of deleting it.

\subsection{Add and customize page numbers}\label{page-numbers}

Page numbers help readers keep track of and reference your document more
easily. The simplest way to insert page numbers is the
\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/\#parameters-numbering}{\texttt{\ numbering\ }}
argument of the \href{/docs/reference/layout/page/}{\texttt{\ page\ }}
set rule. You can pass a
\href{/docs/reference/model/numbering/\#parameters-numbering}{\emph{numbering
pattern}} string that shows how you want your pages to be numbered.

\begin{verbatim}
#set page(numbering: "1")

This is a numbered page.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=7.38542in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/tItTkMk79gxARzJosrxVsgAAAAAAAAAA.png}

Above, you can check out the simplest conceivable example. It adds a
single Arabic page number at the center of the footer. You can specify
other characters than \texttt{\ "1"\ } to get other numerals. For
example, \texttt{\ "i"\ } will yield lowercase Roman numerals. Any
character that is not interpreted as a number will be output as-is. For
example, put dashes around your page number by typing this:

\begin{verbatim}
#set page(numbering: "â 1 â")

This is a â numbered â page.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=7.38542in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/1_R2fSOS46hX8DevWO3SHwAAAAAAAAAA.png}

You can add the total number of pages by entering a second number
character in the string.

\begin{verbatim}
#set page(numbering: "1 of 1")

This is one of many numbered pages.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=7.38542in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/y7IZgFjQvtyaq__YsS98MAAAAAAAAAAA.png}

Go to the
\href{/docs/reference/model/numbering/\#parameters-numbering}{\texttt{\ numbering\ }
function reference} to learn more about the arguments you can pass here.

In case you need to right- or left-align the page number, use the
\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/\#parameters-number-align}{\texttt{\ number-align\ }}
argument of the \href{/docs/reference/layout/page/}{\texttt{\ page\ }}
set rule. Alternating alignment between even and odd pages is not
currently supported using this property. To do this,
you\textquotesingle ll need to specify a custom footer with your
footnote and query the page counter as described in the section on
conditionally omitting headers and footers.

\subsubsection{Custom footer with page
numbers}\label{custom-footer-with-page-numbers}

Sometimes, you need to add other content than a page number to your
footer. However, once a footer is specified, the
\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/\#parameters-numbering}{\texttt{\ numbering\ }}
argument of the \href{/docs/reference/layout/page/}{\texttt{\ page\ }}
set rule is ignored. This section shows you how to add a custom footer
with page numbers and more.

\begin{verbatim}
#set page(footer: context [
  *American Society of Proceedings*
  #h(1fr)
  #counter(page).display(
    "1/1",
    both: true,
  )
])

This page has a custom footer.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=7.38542in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/pa4FfkSAmZ8SbHMJhFhITAAAAAAAAAAA.png}

First, we add some strongly emphasized text on the left and add free
space to fill the line. Then, we call \texttt{\ counter(page)\ } to
retrieve the page counter and use its \texttt{\ display\ } function to
show its current value. We also set \texttt{\ both\ } to
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ true\ }}\texttt{\ } so that our numbering pattern
applies to the current \emph{and} final page number.

We can also get more creative with the page number. For example,
let\textquotesingle s insert a circle for each page.

\begin{verbatim}
#set page(footer: context [
  *Fun Typography Club*
  #h(1fr)
  #let (num,) = counter(page).get()
  #let circles = num * (
    box(circle(
      radius: 2pt,
      fill: navy,
    )),
  )
  #box(
    inset: (bottom: 1pt),
    circles.join(h(1pt))
  )
])

This page has a custom footer.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=7.38542in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/Px4MgFDGZh5TfTBwUSS_KAAAAAAAAAAA.png}

In this example, we use the number of pages to create an array of
\href{/docs/reference/visualize/circle/}{circles} . The circles are
wrapped in a \href{/docs/reference/layout/box/}{box} so they can all
appear on the same line because they are blocks and would otherwise
create paragraph breaks. The length of this
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/array/}{array} depends on the current
page number.

We then insert the circles at the right side of the footer, with 1pt of
space between them. The join method of an array will attempt to
\href{/docs/reference/scripting/\#blocks}{\emph{join}} the different
values of an array into a single value, interspersed with its argument.
In our case, we get a single content value with circles and spaces
between them that we can use with the align function. Finally, we use
another box to ensure that the text and the circles can share a line and
use the
\href{/docs/reference/layout/box/\#parameters-inset}{\texttt{\ inset\ }
argument} to raise the circles a bit so they line up nicely with the
text.

\subsubsection{Reset the page number and skip pages}\label{skip-pages}

Do you, at some point in your document, need to reset the page number?
Maybe you want to start with the first page only after the title page.
Or maybe you need to skip a few page numbers because you will insert
pages into the final printed product.

The right way to modify the page number is to manipulate the page
\href{/docs/reference/introspection/counter/}{counter} . The simplest
manipulation is to set the counter back to 1.

\begin{verbatim}
#counter(page).update(1)
\end{verbatim}

This line will reset the page counter back to one. It should be placed
at the start of a page because it will otherwise create a page break.
You can also update the counter given its previous value by passing a
function:

\begin{verbatim}
#counter(page).update(n => n + 5)
\end{verbatim}

In this example, we skip five pages. \texttt{\ n\ } is the current value
of the page counter and \texttt{\ n\ +\ 5\ } is the return value of our
function.

In case you need to retrieve the actual page number instead of the value
of the page counter, you can use the
\href{/docs/reference/introspection/location/\#definitions-page}{\texttt{\ page\ }}
method on the return value of the
\href{/docs/reference/introspection/here/}{\texttt{\ here\ }} function:

\begin{verbatim}
#counter(page).update(n => n + 5)

// This returns one even though the
// page counter was incremented by 5.
#context here().page()
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/09ytRFFbm_ZOLxjka15n_QAAAAAAAAAA.png}

You can also obtain the page numbering pattern from the location
returned by \texttt{\ here\ } with the
\href{/docs/reference/introspection/location/\#definitions-page-numbering}{\texttt{\ page-numbering\ }}
method.

\subsection{Add columns}\label{columns}

Add columns to your document to fit more on a page while maintaining
legible line lengths. Columns are vertical blocks of text which are
separated by some whitespace. This space is called the gutter.

To lay out your content in columns, just specify the desired number of
columns in a
\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/\#parameters-columns}{\texttt{\ page\ }}
set rule. To adjust the amount of space between the columns, add a set
rule on the \href{/docs/reference/layout/columns/}{\texttt{\ columns\ }
function} , specifying the \texttt{\ gutter\ } parameter.

\begin{verbatim}
#set page(columns: 2)
#set columns(gutter: 12pt)

#lorem(30)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/FgQ5mR5BdbOwdaPvmQss-wAAAAAAAAAA.png}

Very commonly, scientific papers have a single-column title and
abstract, while the main body is set in two-columns. To achieve this
effect, Typst\textquotesingle s
\href{/docs/reference/layout/place/}{\texttt{\ place\ } function} can
temporarily escape the two-column layout by specifying
\texttt{\ float:\ }{\texttt{\ true\ }}\texttt{\ } and
\texttt{\ scope:\ }{\texttt{\ "parent"\ }}\texttt{\ } :

\begin{verbatim}
#set page(columns: 2)
#set par(justify: true)

#place(
  top + center,
  float: true,
  scope: "parent",
  text(1.4em, weight: "bold")[
    Impacts of Odobenidae
  ],
)

== About seals in the wild
#lorem(80)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/rwgbgpUV52923GFV_9bCEQAAAAAAAAAA.png}

\emph{Floating placement} refers to elements being pushed to the top or
bottom of the column or page, with the remaining content flowing in
between. It is also frequently used for
\href{/docs/reference/model/figure/\#parameters-placement}{figures} .

\subsubsection{Use columns anywhere in your
document}\label{columns-anywhere}

To create columns within a nested layout, e.g. within a rectangle, you
can use the \href{/docs/reference/layout/columns/}{\texttt{\ columns\ }
function} directly. However, it really should only be used within nested
layouts. At the page-level, the page set rule is preferrable because it
has better interactions with things like page-level floats, footnotes,
and line numbers.

\begin{verbatim}
#rect(
  width: 6cm,
  height: 3.5cm,
  columns(2, gutter: 12pt)[
    In the dimly lit gas station,
    a solitary taxi stood silently,
    its yellow paint fading with
    time. Its windows were dark,
    its engine idle, and its tires
    rested on the cold concrete.
  ]
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/4ald2xJRDpaFMxVXu7aiUQAAAAAAAAAA.png}

\subsubsection{Balanced columns}\label{balanced-columns}

If the columns on the last page of a document differ greatly in length,
they may create a lopsided and unappealing layout.
That\textquotesingle s why typographers will often equalize the length
of columns on the last page. This effect is called balancing columns.
Typst cannot yet balance columns automatically. However, you can balance
columns manually by placing
\href{/docs/reference/layout/colbreak/}{\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ colbreak\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }}
at an appropriate spot in your markup, creating the desired column break
manually.

\subsection{One-off modifications}\label{one-off-modifications}

You do not need to override your page settings if you need to insert a
single page with a different setup. For example, you may want to insert
a page that\textquotesingle s flipped to landscape to insert a big table
or change the margin and columns for your title page. In this case, you
can call \href{/docs/reference/layout/page/}{\texttt{\ page\ }} as a
function with your content as an argument and the overrides as the other
arguments. This will insert enough new pages with your overridden
settings to place your content on them. Typst will revert to the page
settings from the set rule after the call.

\begin{verbatim}
#page(flipped: true)[
  = Multiplication table

  #table(
    columns: 5 * (1fr,),
    ..for x in range(1, 10) {
      for y in range(1, 6) {
        (str(x*y),)
      }
    }
  )
]
\end{verbatim}

\section{Guide for LaTeX users}\label{guide-for-latex-users}

This page is a good starting point if you have used LaTeX before and
want to try out Typst. We will explore the main differences between
these two systems from a user perspective. Although Typst is not built
upon LaTeX and has a different syntax, you will learn how to use your
LaTeX skills to get a head start.

Just like LaTeX, Typst is a markup-based typesetting system: You compose
your document in a text file and mark it up with commands and other
syntax. Then, you use a compiler to typeset the source file into a PDF.
However, Typst also differs from LaTeX in several aspects: For one,
Typst uses more dedicated syntax (like you may know from Markdown) for
common tasks. Typst\textquotesingle s commands are also more principled:
They all work the same, so unlike in LaTeX, you just need to understand
a few general concepts instead of learning different conventions for
each package. Moreover Typst compiles faster than LaTeX: Compilation
usually takes milliseconds, not seconds, so the web app and the compiler
can both provide instant previews.

In the following, we will cover some of the most common questions a user
switching from LaTeX will have when composing a document in Typst. If
you prefer a step-by-step introduction to Typst, check out our
\href{/docs/tutorial/}{tutorial} .

\subsection{Installation}\label{installation}

You have two ways to use Typst: In \href{https://typst.app/signup/}{our
web app} or by \href{https://github.com/typst/typst/releases}{installing
the compiler} on your computer. When you use the web app, we provide a
batteries-included collaborative editor and run Typst in your browser,
no installation required.

If you choose to use Typst on your computer instead, you can download
the compiler as a single, small binary which any user can run, no root
privileges required. Unlike LaTeX, packages are downloaded when you
first use them and then cached locally, keeping your Typst installation
lean. You can use your own editor and decide where to store your files
with the local compiler.

\subsection{How do I create a new, empty
document?}\label{getting-started}

That\textquotesingle s easy. You just create a new, empty text file (the
file extension is \texttt{\ .typ\ } ). No boilerplate is needed to get
started. Simply start by writing your text. It will be set on an empty
A4-sized page. If you are using the web app, click "+ Empty document" to
create a new project with a file and enter the editor.
\href{/docs/reference/model/parbreak/}{Paragraph breaks} work just as
they do in LaTeX, just use a blank line.

\begin{verbatim}
Hey there!

Here are two paragraphs. The
output is shown to the right.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/1Xaxf-Fz-W7agcXqKmLyjQAAAAAAAAAA.png}

If you want to start from an preexisting LaTeX document instead, you can
use \href{https://pandoc.org}{Pandoc} to convert your source code to
Typst markup. This conversion is also built into our web app, so you can
upload your \texttt{\ .tex\ } file to start your project in Typst.

\subsection{How do I create section headings, emphasis,
...?}\label{elements}

LaTeX uses the command \texttt{\ \textbackslash{}section\ } to create a
section heading. Nested headings are indicated with
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}subsection\ } ,
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}subsubsection\ } , etc. Depending on your
document class, there is also \texttt{\ \textbackslash{}part\ } or
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}chapter\ } .

In Typst, \href{/docs/reference/model/heading/}{headings} are less
verbose: You prefix the line with the heading on it with an equals sign
and a space to get a first-order heading:
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ =\ Introduction\ }}\texttt{\ } . If you need a
second-order heading, you use two equals signs:
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ ==\ In\ this\ paper\ }}\texttt{\ } . You can nest
headings as deeply as you\textquotesingle d like by adding more equals
signs.

Emphasis (usually rendered as italic text) is expressed by enclosing
text in \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \_underscores\_\ }}\texttt{\ } and strong
emphasis (usually rendered in boldface) by using
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ *stars*\ }}\texttt{\ } instead.

Here is a list of common markup commands used in LaTeX and their Typst
equivalents. You can also check out the
\href{/docs/reference/syntax/}{full syntax cheat sheet} .

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}

\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ +\ }}\texttt{\ List\ } &
\href{/docs/reference/model/enum/}{\texttt{\ enum\ }} \\

\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \$\ }}\texttt{\ x\ =\ y\ }{\texttt{\ \$\ }}\texttt{\ }
& \href{/docs/reference/math/equation/}{\texttt{\ equation\ }} \\
\end{longtable}

\href{/docs/reference/model/list/}{Lists} do not rely on environments in
Typst. Instead, they have lightweight syntax like headings. To create an
unordered list ( \texttt{\ itemize\ } ), prefix each line of an item
with a hyphen:

\begin{verbatim}
To write this list in Typst...

```latex
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fast
  \item Flexible
  \item Intuitive
\end{itemize}
```

...just type this:

- Fast
- Flexible
- Intuitive
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/EtxJBpmzn-Q3caUem89mOQAAAAAAAAAA.png}

Nesting lists works just by using proper indentation. Adding a blank
line in between items results in a more
\href{/docs/reference/model/list/\#parameters-tight}{widely} spaced
list.

To get a \href{/docs/reference/model/enum/}{numbered list} (
\texttt{\ enumerate\ } ) instead, use a \texttt{\ +\ } instead of the
hyphen. For a \href{/docs/reference/model/terms/}{term list} (
\texttt{\ description\ } ), write
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ /\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ Term\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ Description\ }
instead.

\subsection{How do I use a command?}\label{commands}

LaTeX heavily relies on commands (prefixed by backslashes). It uses
these \emph{macros} to affect the typesetting process and to insert and
manipulate content. Some commands accept arguments, which are most
frequently enclosed in curly braces:
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}cite\{rasmus\}\ } .

Typst differentiates between
\href{/docs/reference/scripting/\#blocks}{markup mode and code mode} .
The default is markup mode, where you compose text and apply syntactic
constructs such as
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ *stars\ for\ bold\ text*\ }}\texttt{\ } . Code
mode, on the other hand, parallels programming languages like Python,
providing the option to input and execute segments of code.

Within Typst\textquotesingle s markup, you can switch to code mode for a
single command (or rather, \emph{expression} ) using a hash (
\texttt{\ \#\ } ). This is how you call functions to, for example, split
your project into different
\href{/docs/reference/scripting/\#modules}{files} or render text based
on some \href{/docs/reference/scripting/\#conditionals}{condition} .
Within code mode, it is possible to include normal markup
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/content/}{\emph{content}} by using
square brackets. Within code mode, this content is treated just as any
other normal value for a variable.

\begin{verbatim}
First, a rectangle:
#rect()

Let me show how to do
#underline([_underlined_ text])

We can also do some maths:
#calc.max(3, 2 * 4)

And finally a little loop:
#for x in range(3) [
  Hi #x.
]
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/YRh-AUkIq4C1mI8DVTggswAAAAAAAAAA.png}

A function call always involves the name of the function (
\href{/docs/reference/visualize/rect/}{\texttt{\ rect\ }} ,
\href{/docs/reference/text/underline/}{\texttt{\ underline\ }} ,
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/calc/\#functions-max}{\texttt{\ calc.max\ }}
,
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/array/\#definitions-range}{\texttt{\ range\ }}
) followed by parentheses (as opposed to LaTeX where the square brackets
and curly braces are optional if the macro requires no arguments). The
expected list of arguments passed within those parentheses depends on
the concrete function and is specified in the
\href{/docs/reference/}{reference} .

\subsubsection{Arguments}\label{arguments}

A function can have multiple arguments. Some arguments are positional,
i.e., you just provide the value: The function
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ lower\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "SCREAM"\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }
returns its argument in all-lowercase. Many functions use named
arguments instead of positional arguments to increase legibility. For
example, the dimensions and stroke of a rectangle are defined with named
arguments:

\begin{verbatim}
#rect(
  width: 2cm,
  height: 1cm,
  stroke: red,
)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/qhelTU2eEzhkL0zp__ciIAAAAAAAAAAA.png}

You specify a named argument by first entering its name (above,
it\textquotesingle s \texttt{\ width\ } , \texttt{\ height\ } , and
\texttt{\ stroke\ } ), then a colon, followed by the value (
\texttt{\ 2cm\ } , \texttt{\ 1cm\ } , \texttt{\ red\ } ). You can find
the available named arguments in the \href{/docs/reference/}{reference
page} for each function or in the autocomplete panel when typing. Named
arguments are similar to how some LaTeX environments are configured, for
example, you would type
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}begin\{enumerate\}{[}label=\{\textbackslash{}alph*)\}{]}\ }
to start a list with the labels \texttt{\ a)\ } , \texttt{\ b)\ } , and
so on.

Often, you want to provide some
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/content/}{content} to a function. For
example, the LaTeX command
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}underline\{Alternative\ A\}\ } would translate
to
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ underline\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ {[}\ }}\texttt{\ Alternative\ A\ }{\texttt{\ {]}\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }
in Typst. The square brackets indicate that a value is
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/content/}{content} . Within these
brackets, you can use normal markup. However, that\textquotesingle s a
lot of parentheses for a pretty simple construct. This is why you can
also move trailing content arguments after the parentheses (and omit the
parentheses if they would end up empty).

\begin{verbatim}
Typst is an #underline[alternative]
to LaTeX.

#rect(fill: aqua)[Get started here!]
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/mXv-36m3C2iLosBLIxMjHwAAAAAAAAAA.png}

\subsubsection{Data types}\label{data-types}

You likely already noticed that the arguments have distinctive data
types. Typst supports many \href{/docs/reference/foundations/type/}{data
types} . Below, there is a table with some of the most important ones
and how to write them. In order to specify values of any of these types,
you have to be in code mode!

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
Data type & Example \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/content/}{Content} &
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ {[}\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ *fast*\ }}\texttt{\ typesetting\ }{\texttt{\ {]}\ }}\texttt{\ } \\
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/str/}{String} &
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "Pietro\ S.\ Author"\ }}\texttt{\ } \\
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/int/}{Integer} &
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 23\ }}\texttt{\ } \\
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/float/}{Floating point number} &
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 1.459\ }}\texttt{\ } \\
\href{/docs/reference/layout/length/}{Absolute length} &
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 12pt\ }}\texttt{\ } ,
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 5in\ }}\texttt{\ } ,
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 0.3cm\ }}\texttt{\ } , ... \\
\href{/docs/reference/layout/ratio/}{Relative length} &
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ 65\%\ }}\texttt{\ } \\
\end{longtable}

The difference between content and string is that content can contain
markup, including function calls, while a string really is just a plain
sequence of characters.

Typst provides \href{/docs/reference/scripting/\#conditionals}{control
flow constructs} and
\href{/docs/reference/scripting/\#operators}{operators} such as
\texttt{\ +\ } for adding things or \texttt{\ ==\ } for checking
equality between two variables.

You can also store values, including functions, in your own
\href{/docs/reference/scripting/\#bindings}{variables} . This can be
useful to perform computations on them, create reusable automations, or
reference a value multiple times. The variable binding is accomplished
with the let keyword, which works similar to
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}newcommand\ } :

\begin{verbatim}
// Store the integer `5`.
#let five = 5

// Define a function that
// increments a value.
#let inc(i) = i + 1

// Reference the variables.
I have #five fingers.

If I had one more, I'd have
#inc(five) fingers. Whoa!
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/B033fxNtvCwYya9MX4R6xwAAAAAAAAAA.png}

\subsubsection{Commands to affect the remaining document}\label{rules}

In LaTeX, some commands like
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}textbf\{bold\ text\}\ } receive an argument in
curly braces and only affect that argument. Other commands such as
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}bfseries\ bold\ text\ } act as switches (LaTeX
calls this a declaration), altering the appearance of all subsequent
content within the document or current scope.

In Typst, the same function can be used both to affect the appearance
for the remainder of the document, a block (or scope), or just its
arguments. For example,
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ text\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ weight\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "bold"\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ {[}\ }}\texttt{\ bold\ text\ }{\texttt{\ {]}\ }}\texttt{\ }
will only embolden its argument, while
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ set\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ text\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ weight\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "bold"\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }
will embolden any text until the end of the current block, or, if there
is none, document. The effects of a function are immediately obvious
based on whether it is used in a call or a
\href{/docs/reference/styling/\#set-rules}{set rule.}

\begin{verbatim}
I am starting out with small text.

#set text(14pt)

This is a bit #text(18pt)[larger,]
don't you think?
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/aX-wYquEk7ekHdAWcGZ3-wAAAAAAAAAA.png}

Set rules may appear anywhere in the document. They can be thought of as
default argument values of their respective function:

\begin{verbatim}
#set enum(numbering: "I.")

Good results can only be obtained by
+ following best practices
+ being aware of current results
  of other researchers
+ checking the data for biases
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/FTzkApPthDlHdofpWCjnfwAAAAAAAAAA.png}

The \texttt{\ +\ } is syntactic sugar (think of it as an abbreviation)
for a call to the \href{/docs/reference/model/enum/}{\texttt{\ enum\ }}
function, to which we apply a set rule above.
\href{/docs/reference/syntax/}{Most syntax is linked to a function in
this way.} If you need to style an element beyond what its arguments
enable, you can completely redefine its appearance with a
\href{/docs/reference/styling/\#show-rules}{show rule} (somewhat
comparable to \texttt{\ \textbackslash{}renewcommand\ } ).

You can achieve the effects of LaTeX commands like
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}textbf\ } ,
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}textsf\ } ,
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}rmfamily\ } ,
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}mdseries\ } , and
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}itshape\ } with the
\href{/docs/reference/text/text/\#parameters-font}{\texttt{\ font\ }} ,
\href{/docs/reference/text/text/\#parameters-style}{\texttt{\ style\ }}
, and
\href{/docs/reference/text/text/\#parameters-weight}{\texttt{\ weight\ }}
arguments of the \texttt{\ text\ } function. The text function can be
used in a set rule (declaration style) or with a content argument. To
replace \texttt{\ \textbackslash{}textsc\ } , you can use the
\href{/docs/reference/text/smallcaps/}{\texttt{\ smallcaps\ }} function,
which renders its content argument as smallcaps. Should you want to use
it declaration style (like \texttt{\ \textbackslash{}scshape\ } ), you
can use an \href{/docs/reference/styling/\#show-rules}{\emph{everything}
show rule} that applies the function to the rest of the scope:

\begin{verbatim}
#show: smallcaps

Boisterous Accusations
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{How do I load a document class?}\label{templates}

In LaTeX, you start your main \texttt{\ .tex\ } file with the
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}documentclass\{article\}\ } command to define
how your document is supposed to look. In that command, you may have
replaced \texttt{\ article\ } with another value such as
\texttt{\ report\ } and \texttt{\ amsart\ } to select a different look.

When using Typst, you style your documents with
\href{/docs/reference/foundations/function/}{functions} . Typically, you
use a template that provides a function that styles your whole document.
First, you import the function from a template file. Then, you apply it
to your whole document. This is accomplished with a
\href{/docs/reference/styling/\#show-rules}{show rule} that wraps the
following document in a given function. The following example
illustrates how it works:

\begin{verbatim}
#import "conf.typ": conf
#show: conf.with(
  title: [
    Towards Improved Modelling
  ],
  authors: (
    (
      name: "Theresa Tungsten",
      affiliation: "Artos Institute",
      email: "tung@artos.edu",
    ),
    (
      name: "Eugene Deklan",
      affiliation: "Honduras State",
      email: "e.deklan@hstate.hn",
    ),
  ),
  abstract: lorem(80),
)

Let's get started writing this
article by putting insightful
paragraphs right here!
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=12.75in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/k47Rrbrcbzmkzl-uxGd1cAAAAAAAAAAA.png}

The
\href{/docs/reference/scripting/\#modules}{\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ import\ }}\texttt{\ }}
statement makes \href{/docs/reference/foundations/function/}{functions}
(and other definitions) from another file available. In this example, it
imports the \texttt{\ conf\ } function from the \texttt{\ conf.typ\ }
file. This function formats a document as a conference article. We use a
show rule to apply it to the document and also configure some metadata
of the article. After applying the show rule, we can start writing our
article right away!

You can also use templates from Typst Universe (which is
Typst\textquotesingle s equivalent of CTAN) using an import statement
like this:
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ import\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "@preview/elsearticle:0.2.1"\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ elsearticle\ }
. Check the documentation of an individual template to learn the name of
its template function. Templates and packages from Typst Universe are
automatically downloaded when you first use them.

In the web app, you can choose to create a project from a template on
Typst Universe or even create your own using the template wizard.
Locally, you can use the \texttt{\ typst\ init\ } CLI to create a new
project from a template. Check out
\href{https://typst.app/universe/search/?kind=templates}{the list of
templates} published on Typst Universe. You can also take a look at the
\href{https://github.com/qjcg/awesome-typst}{\texttt{\ awesome-typst\ }
repository} to find community templates that aren\textquotesingle t
available through Universe.

You can also \href{/docs/tutorial/making-a-template/}{create your own,
custom templates.} They are shorter and more readable than the
corresponding LaTeX \texttt{\ .sty\ } files by orders of magnitude, so
give it a try!

Functions are Typst\textquotesingle s "commands" and can transform their
arguments to an output value, including document \emph{content.}
Functions are "pure", which means that they cannot have any effects
beyond creating an output value / output content. This is in stark
contrast to LaTeX macros that can have arbitrary effects on your
document.

To let a function style your whole document, the show rule processes
everything that comes after it and calls the function specified after
the colon with the result as an argument. The \texttt{\ .with\ } part is
a \emph{method} that takes the \texttt{\ conf\ } function and
pre-configures some if its arguments before passing it on to the show
rule.

\subsection{How do I load packages?}\label{packages}

Typst is "batteries included," so the equivalent of many popular LaTeX
packages is built right-in. Below, we compiled a table with frequently
loaded packages and their corresponding Typst functions.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
LaTeX Package & Typst Alternative \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
graphicx, svg &
\href{/docs/reference/visualize/image/}{\texttt{\ image\ }} function \\
tabularx & \href{/docs/reference/model/table/}{\texttt{\ table\ }} ,
\href{/docs/reference/layout/grid/}{\texttt{\ grid\ }} functions \\
fontenc, inputenc, unicode-math & Just start writing! \\
babel, polyglossia &
\href{/docs/reference/text/text/\#parameters-lang}{\texttt{\ text\ }}
function:
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ set\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ text\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ lang\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "zh"\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ } \\
amsmath & \href{/docs/reference/math/}{Math mode} \\
amsfonts, amssymb & \href{/docs/reference/symbols/}{\texttt{\ sym\ }}

\href{/docs/reference/layout/page/}{\texttt{\ page\ }} function \\
xcolor &
\href{/docs/reference/text/text/\#parameters-fill}{\texttt{\ text\ }}
function:
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ set\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ text\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ fill\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ rgb\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "\#0178A4"\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ } \\

function and syntax \\
parskip &
\href{/docs/reference/layout/block/\#parameters-spacing}{\texttt{\ block\ }}
and
\href{/docs/reference/model/par/\#parameters-first-line-indent}{\texttt{\ par\ }}
functions \\

\href{/docs/reference/text/text/\#parameters-lang}{\texttt{\ text\ }}
language and type \texttt{\ "\ } or \texttt{\ \textquotesingle{}\ } \\

function \\
enumitem & \href{/docs/reference/model/list/}{\texttt{\ list\ }} ,
\href{/docs/reference/model/enum/}{\texttt{\ enum\ }} ,
\href{/docs/reference/model/terms/}{\texttt{\ terms\ }} functions \\
\end{longtable}

Although \emph{many} things are built-in, not everything can be.
That\textquotesingle s why Typst has its own
\href{https://typst.app/universe/}{package ecosystem} where the
community share its creations and automations. Let\textquotesingle s
take, for instance, the \emph{cetz} package: This package allows you to
create complex drawings and plots. To use cetz in your document, you can
just write:

\begin{verbatim}
#import "@preview/cetz:0.2.1"
\end{verbatim}

(The \texttt{\ @preview\ } is a \emph{namespace} that is used while the
package manager is still in its early and experimental state. It will be
replaced in the future.)

Aside from the official package hub, you might also want to check out
the \href{https://github.com/qjcg/awesome-typst}{awesome-typst
repository} , which compiles a curated list of resources created for
Typst.

If you need to load functions and variables from another file within
your project, for example to use a template, you can use the same
\href{/docs/reference/scripting/\#modules}{\texttt{\ import\ }}
statement with a file name rather than a package specification. To
instead include the textual content of another file, you can use an
\href{/docs/reference/scripting/\#modules}{\texttt{\ include\ }}
statement. It will retrieve the content of the specified file and put it
in your document.

\subsection{How do I input maths?}\label{maths}

To enter math mode in Typst, just enclose your equation in dollar signs.
You can enter display mode by adding spaces or newlines between the
equation\textquotesingle s contents and its enclosing dollar signs.

\begin{verbatim}
The sum of the numbers from
$1$ to $n$ is:

$ sum_(k=1)^n k = (n(n+1))/2 $
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/_cQQzHlyveS6_BoZXnzzQQAAAAAAAAAA.png}

\href{/docs/reference/math/}{Math mode} works differently than regular
markup or code mode. Numbers and single characters are displayed
verbatim, while multiple consecutive (non-number) characters will be
interpreted as Typst variables.

Typst pre-defines a lot of useful variables in math mode. All Greek (
\texttt{\ alpha\ } , \texttt{\ beta\ } , ...) and some Hebrew letters (
\texttt{\ alef\ } , \texttt{\ bet\ } , ...) are available through their
name. Some symbols are additionally available through shorthands, such
as \texttt{\ \textless{}=\ } , \texttt{\ \textgreater{}=\ } , and
\texttt{\ -\textgreater{}\ } .

Refer to the \href{/docs/reference/symbols/}{symbol pages} for a full
list of the symbols. If a symbol is missing, you can also access it
through a \href{/docs/reference/syntax/\#escapes}{Unicode escape
sequence} .

Alternate and related forms of symbols can often be selected by
\href{/docs/reference/symbols/symbol/}{appending a modifier} after a
period. For example, \texttt{\ arrow.l.squiggly\ } inserts a squiggly
left-pointing arrow. If you want to insert multiletter text in your
expression instead, enclose it in double quotes:

\begin{verbatim}
$ delta "if" x <= 5 $
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/jk1sG5lCs-ZQ-s2nXNTbTwAAAAAAAAAA.png}

In Typst, delimiters will scale automatically for their expressions,
just as if \texttt{\ \textbackslash{}left\ } and
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}right\ } commands were implicitly inserted in
LaTeX. You can customize delimiter behaviour using the
\href{/docs/reference/math/lr/\#functions-lr}{\texttt{\ lr\ } function}
. To prevent a pair of delimiters from scaling, you can escape them with
backslashes.

Typst will automatically set terms around a slash \texttt{\ /\ } as a
fraction while honoring operator precedence. All round parentheses not
made redundant by the fraction will appear in the output.

\begin{verbatim}
$ f(x) = (x + 1) / x $
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/hWpFm1Wb3In32sS_SEIHvgAAAAAAAAAA.png}

\href{/docs/reference/math/attach/\#functions-attach}{Sub- and
superscripts} work similarly in Typst and LaTeX.
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \$\ }}\texttt{\ x\ }{\texttt{\ \^{}\ }}\texttt{\ 2\ }{\texttt{\ \$\ }}\texttt{\ }
will produce a superscript,
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \$\ }}\texttt{\ x\ }{\texttt{\ \_\ }}\texttt{\ 2\ }{\texttt{\ \$\ }}\texttt{\ }
yields a subscript. If you want to include more than one value in a sub-
or superscript, enclose their contents in parentheses:
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \$\ }}\texttt{\ x\ }{\texttt{\ \_\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ a\ }{\texttt{\ -\textgreater{}\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ epsilon\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \$\ }}\texttt{\ }
.

Since variables in math mode do not need to be prepended with a
\texttt{\ \#\ } or a \texttt{\ /\ } , you can also call functions
without these special characters:

\begin{verbatim}
$ f(x, y) := cases(
  1 "if" (x dot y)/2 <= 0,
  2 "if" x "is even",
  3 "if" x in NN,
  4 "else",
) $
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/0X1AFPDieBd9jiawKpc0-AAAAAAAAAAA.png}

The above example uses the
\href{/docs/reference/math/cases/}{\texttt{\ cases\ } function} to
describe f. Within the cases function, arguments are delimited using
commas and the arguments are also interpreted as math. If you need to
interpret arguments as Typst values instead, prefix them with a
\texttt{\ \#\ } :

\begin{verbatim}
$ (a + b)^2
  = a^2
  + text(fill: #maroon, 2 a b)
  + b^2 $
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/Wmx0wcFeGyknnvRFv8bI5QAAAAAAAAAA.png}

You can use all Typst functions within math mode and insert any content.
If you want them to work normally, with code mode in the argument list,
you can prefix their call with a \texttt{\ \#\ } . Nobody can stop you
from using rectangles or emoji as your variables anymore:

\begin{verbatim}
$ sum^10_(ð¥¸=1)
  #rect(width: 4mm, height: 2mm)/ð¥¸
  = ð§  maltese $
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/aSVPcEv5ICbnBtcXfhpmfgAAAAAAAAAA.png}

If you\textquotesingle d like to enter your mathematical symbols
directly as Unicode, that is possible, too!

Math calls can have two-dimensional argument lists using \texttt{\ ;\ }
as a delimiter. The most common use for this is the
\href{/docs/reference/math/mat/}{\texttt{\ mat\ } function} that creates
matrices:

\begin{verbatim}
$ mat(
  1, 2, ..., 10;
  2, 2, ..., 10;
  dots.v, dots.v, dots.down, dots.v;
  10, 10, ..., 10;
) $
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=5in,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{/assets/docs/yiSilYGQ1wRBpIK3ON349AAAAAAAAAAA.png}

\subsection{How do I get the "LaTeX look?"}\label{latex-look}

Papers set in LaTeX have an unmistakeable look. This is mostly due to
their font, Computer Modern, justification, narrow line spacing, and
wide margins.

The example below

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  sets wide
  \href{/docs/reference/layout/page/\#parameters-margin}{margins}
\item
  enables
  \href{/docs/reference/model/par/\#parameters-justify}{justification} ,
  \href{/docs/reference/model/par/\#parameters-leading}{tighter lines}
  and
  \href{/docs/reference/model/par/\#parameters-first-line-indent}{first-line-indent}
\item
  \href{/docs/reference/text/text/\#parameters-font}{sets the font} to
  "New Computer Modern", an OpenType derivative of Computer Modern for
  both text and \href{/docs/reference/text/raw/}{code blocks}
\item
  disables paragraph
  \href{/docs/reference/layout/block/\#parameters-spacing}{spacing}
\item
  increases
  \href{/docs/reference/layout/block/\#parameters-spacing}{spacing}
  around \href{/docs/reference/model/heading/}{headings}
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
#set page(margin: 1.75in)
#set par(leading: 0.55em, spacing: 0.55em, first-line-indent: 1.8em, justify: true)
#set text(font: "New Computer Modern")
#show raw: set text(font: "New Computer Modern Mono")
#show heading: set block(above: 1.4em, below: 1em)
\end{verbatim}

This should be a good starting point! If you want to go further, why not
create a reusable template?

\subsection{Bibliographies}\label{bibliographies}

Typst includes a fully-featured bibliography system that is compatible
with BibTeX files. You can continue to use your \texttt{\ .bib\ }
literature libraries by loading them with the
\href{/docs/reference/model/bibliography/}{\texttt{\ bibliography\ }}
function. Another possibility is to use
\href{https://github.com/typst/hayagriva/blob/main/docs/file-format.md}{Typst\textquotesingle s
YAML-based native format} .

Typst uses the Citation Style Language to define and process citation
and bibliography styles. You can compare CSL files to
BibLaTeX\textquotesingle s \texttt{\ .bbx\ } files. The compiler already
includes
\href{/docs/reference/model/bibliography/\#parameters-style}{over 80
citation styles} , but you can use any CSL-compliant style from the
\href{https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles}{CSL repository}
or write your own.

You can cite an entry in your bibliography or reference a label in your
document with the same syntax: \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ @key\ }}\texttt{\ }
(this would reference an entry called \texttt{\ key\ } ). Alternatively,
you can use the \href{/docs/reference/model/cite/}{\texttt{\ cite\ }}
function.

Alternative forms for your citation, such as year only and citations for
natural use in prose (cf. \texttt{\ \textbackslash{}citet\ } and
\texttt{\ \textbackslash{}textcite\ } ) are available with
\href{/docs/reference/model/cite/\#parameters-form}{\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ cite\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \textless{}key\textgreater{}\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ ,\ }}\texttt{\ form\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "prose"\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }}
.

You can find more information on the documentation page of the
\href{/docs/reference/model/bibliography/}{\texttt{\ bibliography\ }}
function.

\subsection{What limitations does Typst currently have compared to
LaTeX?}\label{limitations}

Although Typst can be a LaTeX replacement for many today, there are
still features that Typst does not (yet) support. Here is a list of them
which, where applicable, contains possible workarounds.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Well-established plotting ecosystem.} LaTeX users often create
  elaborate charts along with their documents in PGF/TikZ. The Typst
  ecosystem does not yet offer the same breadth of available options,
  but the ecosystem around the
  \href{https://github.com/cetz-package/cetz}{\texttt{\ cetz\ }} package
  is catching up quickly.
\item
  \textbf{Change page margins without a pagebreak.} In LaTeX, margins
  can always be adjusted, even without a pagebreak. To change margins in
  Typst, you use the
  \href{/docs/reference/layout/page/}{\texttt{\ page\ } function} which
  will force a page break. If you just want a few paragraphs to stretch
  into the margins, then reverting to the old margins, you can use the
  \href{/docs/reference/layout/pad/}{\texttt{\ pad\ } function} with
  negative padding.
\item
  \textbf{Include PDFs as images.} In LaTeX, it has become customary to
  insert vector graphics as PDF or EPS files. Typst supports neither
  format as an image format, but you can easily convert both into SVG
  files with \href{https://cloudconvert.com/pdf-to-svg}{online tools} or
  \href{https://inkscape.org/}{Inkscape} . The web app will
  automatically convert PDF files to SVG files upon uploading them.
\end{itemize}
