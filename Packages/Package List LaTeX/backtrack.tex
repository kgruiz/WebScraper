{ 1.0.0 }

A version-agnostic library for checking the compiler version.

\phantomsection\label{readme}
Backtrack is a simple and performant Typst library that determines the
current compiler version and provides an API for comparing, displaying,
and observing versions.

Unlike the built-in
\href{https://github.com/typst/typst/pull/2016}{version API} which is
only available on Typst 0.9.0+, Backtrack works on any
\href{https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/backtrack/1.0.0/\#version-support}{*}
Typst version. It uses the built-in API when available so that itâ€™ll
continue to work on all future Typst versions without modification.

Additionally, it:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  doesnâ€™t noticeably impact compilation time. All version checks are
  extremely simple, and newer versions are checked first to avoid
  overhead from supporting old versions.
\item
  is automatically tested on \emph{every} supported Typst version to
  ensure reliability.
\item
  can be downloaded and installed manually in addition to being
  available as a package.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example}\label{example}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{\#import "@preview/backtrack:1.0.0": current{-}version, versions}

\NormalTok{You are using Typst \#current{-}version.displayable!}
\NormalTok{\#\{}
\NormalTok{  if current{-}version.cmpable \textless{}= versions.v2023{-}03{-}28.cmpable [}
\NormalTok{    That is ancient.}
\NormalTok{  ] else if current{-}version.cmpable \textless{} versions.v0{-}5{-}0.cmpable [}
\NormalTok{    That is old.}
\NormalTok{  ] else [}
\NormalTok{    That is modern.}
\NormalTok{  ]}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsection{Installation}\label{installation}

There are two ways to install the library:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Use the package on Typst 0.6.0+. This is as simple as adding the
  following line to your document:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{\#import "@preview/backtrack:1.0.0"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  Download and install the library manually:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Download and extract the latest
    \href{https://github.com/TheLukeGuy/backtrack/releases}{release} .
  \item
    Rename \texttt{\ src/lib.typ\ } to \texttt{\ src/backtrack.typ\ } .
  \item
    Move/copy \texttt{\ COPYING\ } into \texttt{\ src/\ } .
  \item
    Rename the \texttt{\ src/\ } directory to \texttt{\ backtrack/\ } .
  \item
    Move/copy the newly-renamed \texttt{\ backtrack/\ } directory into
    your project.
  \item
    Add the following line to your document:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{\#import "[path/to/]backtrack/backtrack.typ"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Documentation}\label{documentation}

See
\href{https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/backtrack/1.0.0/DOCS.md}{DOCS.md}
. Itâ€™s quite short. ðŸ˜€

\subsection{Version Support}\label{version-support}

Backtrack compiles on and can detect these versions:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lcl@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
Version & Status & Notes \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
0.6.0+ & âœ & Also available as a package \\
March 28, 2023â€``0.5.0 & âœ & \\
March 21, 2023 & âœ & Initial public/standalone Typst release \\
February 25, 2023 & ðŸŸ¡ & Detects as February 15, 2023 \\
February 12â€``15, 2023 & âœ & \\
February 2, 2023 & ðŸŸ¡ & Detects as January 30, 2023 \\
January 30, 2023 & âœ & \\
\end{longtable}

The partially-supported versions \emph{may} be possible to detect, but
theyâ€™re tricky since most of their changes are content-related.
Content values were opaque up until the March 21, 2023 release, making
it difficult to automatically check for the presence of these changes.
