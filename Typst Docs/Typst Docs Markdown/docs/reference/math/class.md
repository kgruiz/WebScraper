#  ` class ` Element

Question mark

Element functions can be customized with ` set ` and  ` show ` rules.

Forced use of a certain math class.

This is useful to treat certain symbols as if they were of a different class,
e.g. to make a symbol behave like a relation. The class of a symbol defines
the way it is laid out, including spacing around it, and how its scripts are
attached by default. Note that the latter can always be overridden using [ `
limits ` ](/docs/reference/math/attach/#functions-limits) and [ ` scripts `
](/docs/reference/math/attach/#functions-scripts) .

##  Example

    
    
    #let loves = math.class(
      "relation",
      sym.suit.heart,
    )
    
    $x loves y and y loves 5$
