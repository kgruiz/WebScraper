Emphasizes content by toggling italics.

  * If the current [ text style ](/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-style) is ` "normal"  ` , this turns it into ` "italic"  ` . 
  * If it is already ` "italic"  ` or ` "oblique"  ` , it turns it back to ` "normal"  ` . 

##  Example

    
    
    This is _emphasized._ \
    This is #emph[too.]
    
    #show emph: it => {
      text(blue, it.body)
    }
    
    This is _emphasized_ differently.
