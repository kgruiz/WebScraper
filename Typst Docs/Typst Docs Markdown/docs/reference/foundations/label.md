#  label

A label for an element.

Inserting a label into content attaches it to the closest preceding element
that is not a space. The preceding element must be in the same scope as the
label, which means that ` Hello  #  [  <label> ]  ` , for instance, wouldn't
work.

A labelled element can be [ referenced ](/docs/reference/model/ref/) , [
queried ](/docs/reference/introspection/query/) for, and [ styled
](/docs/reference/styling/) through its label.

Once constructed, you can get the name of a label using [ ` str `
](/docs/reference/foundations/str/#constructor) .

##  Example

    
    
    #show <a>: set text(blue)
    #show label("b"): set text(red)
    
    = Heading <a>
    *Strong* #label("b")

##  Syntax

This function also has dedicated syntax: You can create a label by enclosing
its name in angle brackets. This works both in markup and code. A label's name
can contain letters, numbers, ` _ ` , ` - ` , ` : ` , and ` . ` .

Note that there is a syntactical difference when using the dedicated syntax
for this function. In the code below, the ` <a> ` terminates the heading and
thus attaches to the heading itself, whereas the ` #  label  (  "b"  )  ` is
part of the heading and thus attaches to the heading's text.

    
    
    // Equivalent to `#heading[Introduction] <a>`.
    = Introduction <a>
    
    // Equivalent to `#heading[Conclusion #label("b")]`.
    = Conclusion #label("b")
    

Currently, labels can only be attached to elements in markup mode, not in code
mode. This might change in the future.

##  Constructor

Question mark

If a type has a constructor, you can call it like a function to create a new
value of the type.

Creates a label from a string.

label  (

[ str ](/docs/reference/foundations/str/)

)  -> [ label ](/docs/reference/foundations/label/)

####  ` name `

[ str ](/docs/reference/foundations/str/)
