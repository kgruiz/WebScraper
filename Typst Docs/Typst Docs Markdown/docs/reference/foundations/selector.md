#  selector

A filter for selecting elements within the document.

You can construct a selector in the following ways:

  * you can use an element [ function ](/docs/reference/foundations/function/ "function")
  * you can filter for an element function with [ specific fields ](/docs/reference/foundations/function/#definitions-where)
  * you can use a [ string ](/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or [ regular expression ](/docs/reference/foundations/regex/)
  * you can use a [ ` <label> ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/label/)
  * you can use a [ ` location ` ](/docs/reference/introspection/location/ "`location`")
  * call the [ ` selector ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/ "`selector`") constructor to convert any of the above types into a selector value and use the methods below to refine it 

Selectors are used to [ apply styling rules ](/docs/reference/styling/#show-
rules) to elements. You can also use selectors to [ query
](/docs/reference/introspection/query/ "query") the document for certain types
of elements.

Furthermore, you can pass a selector to several of Typst's built-in functions
to configure their behaviour. One such example is the [ outline
](/docs/reference/model/outline/ "outline") where it can be used to change
which elements are listed within the outline.

Multiple selectors can be combined using the methods shown below. However, not
all kinds of selectors are supported in all places, at the moment.

##  Example

    
    
    #context query(
      heading.where(level: 1)
        .or(heading.where(level: 2))
    )
    
    = This will be found
    == So will this
    === But this will not.

##  Constructor

Question mark

If a type has a constructor, you can call it like a function to create a new
value of the type.

Turns a value into a selector. The following values are accepted:

  * An element function like a ` heading ` or ` figure ` . 
  * A ` <label> ` . 
  * A more complex selector like ` heading  .  where  (  level  :  1  )  ` .

)  -> [ selector ](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/)

####  ` target `

[ str ](/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or  [ regex
](/docs/reference/foundations/regex/) or  [ label
](/docs/reference/foundations/label/) or  [ selector
](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/) or  [ location
](/docs/reference/introspection/location/) or  [ function
](/docs/reference/foundations/function/)

Required  Positional

Question mark

Positional parameters are specified in order, without names.

Can be an element function like a ` heading ` or ` figure ` , a ` <label> ` or
a more complex selector like ` heading  .  where  (  level  :  1  )  ` .

##  Definitions

Question mark

Functions and types and can have associated definitions. These are accessed by
specifying the function or type, followed by a period, and then the
definition's name.

###  ` or `

Selects all elements that match this or any of the other selectors.

self  .  or  (

..  [ str ](/docs/reference/foundations/str/) [ regex
](/docs/reference/foundations/regex/) [ label
](/docs/reference/foundations/label/) [ selector
](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/) [ location
](/docs/reference/introspection/location/) [ function
](/docs/reference/foundations/function/)

)  -> [ selector ](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/)

####  ` others `

[ str ](/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or  [ regex
](/docs/reference/foundations/regex/) or  [ label
](/docs/reference/foundations/label/) or  [ selector
](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/) or  [ location
](/docs/reference/introspection/location/) or  [ function
](/docs/reference/foundations/function/)

Required  Positional

Question mark

Positional parameters are specified in order, without names.

Variadic

Question mark

Variadic parameters can be specified multiple times.

The other selectors to match on.

###  ` and `

Selects all elements that match this and all of the other selectors.

self  .  and  (

..  [ str ](/docs/reference/foundations/str/) [ regex
](/docs/reference/foundations/regex/) [ label
](/docs/reference/foundations/label/) [ selector
](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/) [ location
](/docs/reference/introspection/location/) [ function
](/docs/reference/foundations/function/)

)  -> [ selector ](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/)

####  ` others `

[ str ](/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or  [ regex
](/docs/reference/foundations/regex/) or  [ label
](/docs/reference/foundations/label/) or  [ selector
](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/) or  [ location
](/docs/reference/introspection/location/) or  [ function
](/docs/reference/foundations/function/)

Required  Positional

Question mark

Positional parameters are specified in order, without names.

Variadic

Question mark

Variadic parameters can be specified multiple times.

The other selectors to match on.

###  ` before `

Returns a modified selector that will only match elements that occur before
the first match of ` end ` .

self  .  before  (

[ label ](/docs/reference/foundations/label/) [ selector
](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/) [ location
](/docs/reference/introspection/location/) [ function
](/docs/reference/foundations/function/) ,  inclusive  :  [ bool
](/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) ,

)  -> [ selector ](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/)

####  ` end `

[ label ](/docs/reference/foundations/label/) or  [ selector
](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/) or  [ location
](/docs/reference/introspection/location/) or  [ function
](/docs/reference/foundations/function/)

Required  Positional

Question mark

Positional parameters are specified in order, without names.

The original selection will end at the first match of ` end ` .

####  ` inclusive `

[ bool ](/docs/reference/foundations/bool/)

Whether ` end ` itself should match or not. This is only relevant if both
selectors match the same type of element. Defaults to ` true  ` .

Default: ` true  `

###  ` after `

Returns a modified selector that will only match elements that occur after the
first match of ` start ` .

self  .  after  (

[ label ](/docs/reference/foundations/label/) [ selector
](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/) [ location
](/docs/reference/introspection/location/) [ function

](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/) or  [ location
](/docs/reference/introspection/location/) or  [ function
](/docs/reference/foundations/function/)

Required  Positional

Question mark

The original selection will start at the first match of ` start ` .

####  ` inclusive `

[ bool ](/docs/reference/foundations/bool/)
