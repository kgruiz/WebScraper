#  ` here ` Contextual

Question mark

Contextual functions can only be used when the context is known

Provides the current location in the document.

You can think of ` here ` as a low-level building block that directly extracts
the current location from the active [ context ](/docs/reference/context/
"context") . Some other functions use it internally: For instance, ` counter
.  get  (  )  ` is equivalent to ` counter  .  at  (  here  (  )  )  ` .

Within show rules on [ locatable
](/docs/reference/introspection/location/#locatable) elements, ` here  (  )  `
will match the location of the shown element.

If you want to display the current page number, refer to the documentation of
the [ ` counter ` ](/docs/reference/introspection/counter/ "`counter`") type.
While ` here ` can be used to determine the physical page number, typically
you want the logical page number that may, for instance, have been reset after
a preface.

##  Examples

Determining the current position in the document in combination with the [ `
position ` ](/docs/reference/introspection/location/#definitions-position)
method:

    
    
    #context [
      I am located at
      #here().position()
    ]

Running a [ query ](/docs/reference/introspection/query/ "query") for elements
before the current position:

    
    
    = Introduction
    = Background
    
    There are
    #context query(
      selector(heading).before(here())
    ).len()
    headings before me.
    
    = Conclusion

Refer to the [ ` selector ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/
"`selector`") type for more details on before/after selectors.
