#  Introspection

Interactions between document parts.

This category is home to Typst's introspection capabilities: With the `
counter ` function, you can access and manipulate page, section, figure, and
equation counters or create custom ones. Meanwhile, the ` query ` function
lets you search for elements in the document to construct things like a list
of figures or headers which show the current chapter title.

Most of the functions are _contextual._ It is recommended to read the chapter
on [ context ](/docs/reference/context/ "context") before continuing here.
