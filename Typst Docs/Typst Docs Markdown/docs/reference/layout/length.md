#  length

A size or distance, possibly expressed with contextual units.

Typst supports the following length units:

  * Points: ` 72pt  `
  * Millimeters: ` 254mm  `
  * Centimeters: ` 2.54cm  `
  * Inches: ` 1in  `
  * Relative to font size: ` 2.5em  `

You can multiply lengths with and divide them by integers and floats.

##  Example

    
    
    #rect(width: 20pt)
    #rect(width: 2em)
    #rect(width: 1in)
    
    #(3em + 5pt).em \
    #(20pt).em \
    #(40em + 2pt).abs \
    #(5em).abs

##  Fields

  * ` abs ` : A length with just the absolute component of the current length (that is, excluding the ` em ` component). 
  * ` em ` : The amount of ` em ` units in this length, as a [ float ](/docs/reference/foundations/float/ "float") . 

##  Definitions

Question mark

Functions and types and can have associated definitions. These are accessed by
specifying the function or type, followed by a period, and then the
definition's name.

###  ` pt `

Converts this length to points.

Fails with an error if this length has non-zero ` em ` units (such as ` 5em +
2pt ` instead of just ` 2pt ` ). Use the ` abs ` field (such as in ` (5em +
2pt).abs.pt() ` ) to ignore the ` em ` component of the length (thus
converting only its absolute component).

self  .  pt  (

)  -> [ float ](/docs/reference/foundations/float/)

###  ` mm `

Converts this length to millimeters.

Fails with an error if this length has non-zero ` em ` units. See the [ ` pt `
](/docs/reference/layout/length/#definitions-pt) method for more details.

self  .  mm  (

)  -> [ float ](/docs/reference/foundations/float/)

###  ` cm `

Converts this length to centimeters.

Fails with an error if this length has non-zero ` em ` units. See the [ ` pt `
](/docs/reference/layout/length/#definitions-pt) method for more details.

self  .  cm  (

)  -> [ float ](/docs/reference/foundations/float/)

###  ` inches `

Converts this length to inches.

Fails with an error if this length has non-zero ` em ` units. See the [ ` pt `
](/docs/reference/layout/length/#definitions-pt) method for more details.

self  .  inches  (

)  -> [ float ](/docs/reference/foundations/float/)

###  ` to-absolute `

Resolve this length to an absolute length.

self  .  to-absolute  (

)  -> [ length ](/docs/reference/layout/length/)

    
    
    #set text(size: 12pt)
    #context [
      #(6pt).to-absolute() \
      #(6pt + 10em).to-absolute() \
      #(10em).to-absolute()
    ]
    
    #set text(size: 6pt)
    #context [
      #(6pt).to-absolute() \
      #(6pt + 10em).to-absolute() \
      #(10em).to-absolute()
    ]
