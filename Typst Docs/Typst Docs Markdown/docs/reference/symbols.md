#  Symbols

These two modules give names to symbols and emoji to make them easy to insert
with a normal keyboard. Alternatively, you can also always directly enter
Unicode symbols into your text and formulas. In addition to the symbols listed
below, math mode defines ` dif ` and ` Dif ` . These are not normal symbol
values because they also affect spacing and font style.

##  Shorthands

Shorthands are concise sequences of characters that evoke specific glyphs.
Shorthands and other ways to produce symbols can be used interchangeably. You
can use different sets of shorthands in math and markup mode. Some shorthands,
like ` ~ ` for a non-breaking space produce non-printing symbols, which are
indicated with gray placeholder text.

You can deactivate a shorthand's interpretation by escaping any of its
characters. If you escape a single character in a shorthand, the remaining
unescaped characters may form a different shorthand.
