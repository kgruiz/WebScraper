#  Version 0.7.0 (August 7, 2023)

##  Text and Layout

  * Added support for floating figures through the [ ` placement ` ](/docs/reference/model/figure/#parameters-placement) argument on the figure function 
  * Added support for arbitrary floating content through the [ ` float ` ](/docs/reference/layout/place/#parameters-float) argument on the place function

  * Removed nonsensical top- and bottom-edge options, e.g. _ascender_ for the bottom edge **(Breaking change)**
  * Added [ ` script ` ](/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-script) argument to text function 
  * Added [ ` alternative ` ](/docs/reference/text/smartquote/#parameters-alternative) argument to smart quote function 
  * Added basic i18n for Japanese 
  * Added hyphenation support for ` nb ` and ` nn ` language codes in addition to ` no `
  * Fixed positioning of [ placed elements ](/docs/reference/layout/place/) in containers

##  Export

  * Added support for the alpha channel of RGBA colors in PDF export

  * Large operators and delimiters are now always vertically centered 
  * [ Boxes ](/docs/reference/layout/box/) in equations now sit on the baseline instead of being vertically centered by default. Notably, this does not affect [ blocks ](/docs/reference/layout/block/) because they are not inline elements.

    * Added ` id ` , ` im ` , and ` tr ` text [ operators ](/docs/reference/math/op/)
    * Renamed ` ident ` to ` equiv ` with alias ` eq.triple ` and removed ` ident.strict ` in favor of ` eq.quad `
    * Renamed ` ast.sq ` to ` ast.square ` and ` integral.sq ` to ` integral.square `
    * Renamed ` .eqq ` modifier to ` .equiv ` (and ` .neqq ` to ` .nequiv ` ) for ` tilde ` , ` gt ` , ` lt ` , ` prec ` , and ` succ `
    * Added ` emptyset ` as alias for ` nothing `
    * Added ` lt.curly ` and ` gt.curly ` as aliases for ` prec ` and ` succ `
    * Added ` aleph ` , ` beth ` , and ` gimmel ` as alias for ` alef ` , ` bet ` , and ` gimel `

##  Scripting

  * Fields 
    * Added ` abs ` and ` em ` field to [ lengths ](/docs/reference/layout/length/)
    * Added ` ratio ` and ` length ` field to [ relative lengths ](/docs/reference/layout/relative/)

    * Added ` paint ` , ` thickness ` , ` cap ` , ` join ` , ` dash ` , and ` miter-limit ` field to [ strokes ](/docs/reference/visualize/stroke/)
  * Accessor and utility methods 
    * Added [ ` dedup ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-dedup) method to arrays 
    * Added ` pt ` , ` mm ` , ` cm ` , and ` inches ` method to [ lengths ](/docs/reference/layout/length/)

    * Added ` axis ` , ` start ` , ` end ` , and ` inv ` method to [ directions ](/docs/reference/layout/stack/#parameters-dir)
    * Added ` axis ` and ` inv ` method to [ alignments ](/docs/reference/layout/align/#parameters-alignment)
    * Added ` inv ` method to [ 2d alignments ](/docs/reference/layout/align/#parameters-alignment)
    * Added ` start ` argument to [ ` enumerate ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-enumerate) method on arrays 
  * Added [ ` color.mix ` ](/docs/reference/visualize/color/#definitions-mix) function 
  * Added ` mode ` and ` scope ` arguments to [ ` eval ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/eval/ "`eval`") function 
  * Added [ ` bytes ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/bytes/ "`bytes`") type for holding large byte buffers 
    * Added [ ` encoding ` ](/docs/reference/data-loading/read/#parameters-encoding) argument to read function to read a file as bytes instead of a string 
    * Added [ ` image.decode ` ](/docs/reference/visualize/image/#definitions-decode) function for decoding an image directly from a string or bytes 
    * Added [ ` bytes ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/bytes/ "`bytes`") function for converting a string or an array of integers to bytes 
    * Added [ ` array ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/array/ "`array`") function for converting bytes to an array of integers 
    * Added support for converting bytes to a string with the [ ` str ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/str/ "`str`") function 

##  Tooling and Diagnostics

  * Added support for compiler warnings 
  * Added warning when compilation does not converge within five attempts due to intense use of introspection features 
  * Added warnings for empty emphasis ( ` __ ` and ` ** ` ) 
  * Improved error message for invalid field assignments 
  * Improved error message after single ` # `
  * Improved error message when a keyword is used where an identifier is expected 
  * Fixed parameter autocompletion for functions that are in modules 
  * Import autocompletion now only shows the latest package version until a colon is typed 
  * Fixed autocompletion for dictionary key containing a space 
  * Fixed autocompletion for ` for ` loops 

##  Command line interface

  * Added ` typst query ` subcommand to execute a [ query ](/docs/reference/introspection/query/#command-line-queries) on the command line 
  * The ` --root ` and ` --font-paths ` arguments cannot appear in front of the command anymore **(Breaking change)**
  * Local and cached packages are now stored in directories of the form ` {namespace}/{name}/{version} ` instead of ` {namespace}/{name}-{version} ` **(Breaking change)**
  * Now prioritizes explicitly given fonts (via ` --font-paths ` ) over system and embedded fonts when both exist 
  * Fixed ` typst watch ` not working with some text editors 
  * Fixed displayed compilation time (now includes export) 

##  Miscellaneous Improvements

  * Added [ ` bookmarked ` ](/docs/reference/model/heading/#parameters-bookmarked) argument to heading to control whether a heading becomes part of the PDF outline 
  * Added [ ` caption-pos ` ](/docs/reference/model/figure/#definitions-caption-position) argument to control the position of a figure's caption 
  * Added [ ` metadata ` ](/docs/reference/introspection/metadata/ "`metadata`") function for exposing an arbitrary value to the introspection system 
  * Fixed that a [ ` state ` ](/docs/reference/introspection/state/ "`state`") was identified by the pair ` (key, init) ` instead of just its ` key `
  * Improved indent logic of [ enumerations ](/docs/reference/model/enum/) . Instead of requiring at least as much indent as the end of the marker, they now require only one more space indent than the start of the marker. As a result, even long markers like ` 12. ` work with just 2 spaces of indent. 
  * Fixed bug with indent logic of [ ` raw ` ](/docs/reference/text/raw/ "`raw`") blocks 
  * Fixed a parsing bug with dictionaries 

##  Development

  * Extracted parser and syntax tree into ` typst-syntax ` crate 
  * The ` World::today ` implementation of Typst dependents may need fixing if they have the same [ bug ](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/1842) that the CLI world had
