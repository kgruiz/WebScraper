#  Version 0.8.0 (September 13, 2023)

##  Scripting

  * Plugins (thanks to [ @astrale-sharp ](https://github.com/astrale-sharp) and [ @arnaudgolfouse ](https://github.com/arnaudgolfouse) ) 
    * Typst can now load [ plugins ](/docs/reference/foundations/plugin/) that are compiled to WebAssembly 
    * Anything that can be compiled to WebAssembly can thus be loaded as a plugin 
    * These plugins are fully encapsulated (no access to file system or network) 
    * Plugins can be shipped as part of [ packages ](/docs/reference/scripting/#packages)
    * Plugins work just the same in the web app 
  * Types are now first-class values **(Breaking change)**
    * A [ type ](/docs/reference/foundations/type/ "type") is now itself a value 
    * Some types can be called like functions (those that have a constructor), e.g. [ ` int ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/int/ "`int`") and [ ` str ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/str/ "`str`")
    * Type checks are now of the form ` type  (  10  )  ==  int ` instead of the old ` type  (  10  )  ==  "integer"  ` . [ Compatibility ](/docs/reference/foundations/type/#compatibility) with the old way will remain for a while to give package authors time to upgrade, but it will be removed at some point. 
    * Methods are now syntax sugar for calling a function scoped to a type, meaning that ` "hello"  .  len  (  )  ` is equivalent to ` str  .  len  (  "hello"  )  `
  * Added support for [ ` import ` ](/docs/reference/scripting/#modules) renaming with ` as `
  * Added a [ ` duration ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/duration/ "`duration`") type 
  * Added support for [ CBOR ](/docs/reference/data-loading/cbor/) encoding and decoding 
  * Added encoding and decoding functions from and to bytes for data formats: [ ` json.decode ` ](/docs/reference/data-loading/json/#definitions-decode) , [ ` json.encode ` ](/docs/reference/data-loading/json/#definitions-encode) , and similar functions for other formats 
  * Added [ ` array.intersperse ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-intersperse) function 
  * Added [ ` str.rev ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/str/#definitions-rev) function 
  * Added ` calc.tau ` constant 
  * Made [ bytes ](/docs/reference/foundations/bytes/ "bytes") joinable and addable 
  * Made [ ` array.zip ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-zip) function variadic 
  * Fixed bug with [ ` eval ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/eval/ "`eval`") when the ` mode ` was set to ` "math"  `
  * Fixed bug with [ ` ends-with ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/str/#definitions-ends-with) function on strings 
  * Fixed bug with destructuring in combination with break, continue, and return 
  * Fixed argument types of [ hyperbolic functions ](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-cosh) , they don't allow angles anymore **(Breaking change)**
  * Renamed some color methods: ` rgba ` becomes ` to-rgba ` , ` cmyk ` becomes ` to-cmyk ` , and ` luma ` becomes ` to-luma ` **(Breaking change)**

##  Export

  * Added SVG export (thanks to [ @Enter-tainer ](https://github.com/Enter-tainer) ) 
  * Fixed bugs with PDF font embedding 
  * Added support for page labels that reflect the [ page numbering ](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-numbering) style in the PDF 

##  Text and Layout

  * Added [ ` highlight ` ](/docs/reference/text/highlight/ "`highlight`") function for highlighting text with a background color 
  * Added [ ` polygon.regular ` ](/docs/reference/visualize/polygon/#definitions-regular) function for drawing a regular polygon 
  * Added support for tabs in [ ` raw ` ](/docs/reference/text/raw/ "`raw`") elements alongside [ ` tab-width ` ](/docs/reference/text/raw/#parameters-tab-size) parameter 
  * The layout engine now tries to prevent "runts" (final lines consisting of just a single word) 
  * Added Finnish translations 
  * Added hyphenation support for Polish 
  * Improved handling of consecutive smart quotes of different kinds 
  * Fixed vertical alignments for [ ` number-align ` ](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-number-align) argument on page function **(Breaking change)**
  * Fixed weak pagebreaks after counter updates 
  * Fixed missing text in SVG when the text font is set to "New Computer Modern" 
  * Fixed translations for Chinese 
  * Fixed crash for empty text in show rule 
  * Fixed leading spaces when there's a linebreak after a number and a comma 
  * Fixed placement of floating elements in columns and other containers 
  * Fixed sizing of block containing just a single box 

##  Math

  * Added support for [ augmented matrices ](/docs/reference/math/mat/#parameters-augment)
  * Removed support for automatic matching of fences like ` | ` and ` || ` as there were too many false positives. You can use functions like [ ` abs ` ](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-abs) or [ ` norm ` ](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-norm) or an explicit [ ` lr ` ](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-lr) call instead. **(Breaking change)**
  * Fixed spacing after number with decimal point in math 
  * Fixed bug with primes in subscript 
  * Fixed weak spacing 
  * Fixed crash when text within math contains a newline 

##  Tooling and Diagnostics

  * Added hints when trying to call a function stored in a dictionary without extra parentheses 
  * Fixed hint when referencing an equation without numbering 
  * Added more details to some diagnostics (e.g. when SVG decoding fails) 

##  Command line interface

  * Added ` typst update ` command for self-updating the CLI (thanks to [ @jimvdl ](https://github.com/jimvdl) ) 
  * Added download progress indicator for packages and updates 
  * Added ` --format ` argument to explicitly specify the output format 
  * The CLI now respects proxy configuration through environment variables and has a new ` --cert ` option for setting a custom CA certificate 
  * Fixed crash when field wasn't present and ` --one ` is passed to ` typst query `

##  Miscellaneous Improvements

  * Added [ page setup guide ](/docs/guides/page-setup-guide/)
  * Added [ ` figure.caption ` ](/docs/reference/model/figure/#definitions-caption) function that can be used for simpler figure customization ( **Breaking change** because ` it.caption ` now renders the full caption with supplement in figure show rules and manual outlines) 
  * Moved ` caption-pos ` argument to ` figure.caption ` function and renamed it to ` position ` **(Breaking change)**
  * Added [ ` separator ` ](/docs/reference/model/figure/#definitions-caption-separator) argument to ` figure.caption ` function 
  * Added support for combination of and/or and before/after [ selectors ](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/)
  * Packages can now specify a [ minimum compiler version ](https://github.com/typst/packages#package-format) they require to work 
  * Fixed parser bug where method calls could be moved onto their own line for ` #  let  ` expressions in markup **(Breaking change)**
  * Fixed bugs in sentence and title case conversion for bibliographies 
  * Fixed supplements for alphanumeric and author-title bibliography styles 
  * Fixed off-by-one error in APA bibliography style 

##  Development

  * Made ` Span ` and ` FileId ` more type-safe so that all error conditions must be handled by ` World ` implementors
