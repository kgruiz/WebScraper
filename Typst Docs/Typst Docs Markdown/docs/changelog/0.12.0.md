#  Version 0.12.0 (October 18, 2024)

##  Highlights

  * Added support for multi-column floating [ placement ](/docs/reference/layout/place/#parameters-scope) and [ figures ](/docs/reference/model/figure/#parameters-scope)
  * Added support for automatic [ line numbering ](/docs/reference/model/par/#definitions-line) (often used in academic papers) 
  * Typst's layout engine is now multithreaded. Typical speedups are 2-3x for larger documents. The multithreading operates on page break boundaries, so explicit page breaks are necessary for it to kick in. 
  * Paragraph justification was optimized with a new two-pass algorithm. Speedups are larger for shorter paragraphs and go up to 6x. 
  * Highly reduced PDF file sizes due to better font subsetting (thanks to [ @LaurenzV ](https://github.com/LaurenzV) ) 
  * Emoji are now exported properly in PDF 
  * Added initial support for PDF/A. For now, only the PDF/A-2b profile is supported, but more is planned for the future. 
  * Added various options for configuring the CLI's environment (fonts, package paths, etc.) 
  * Text show rules now match across multiple text elements 
  * Block-level equations can now optionally break over multiple pages 
  * Fixed a bug where some fonts would not print correctly on professional printers 
  * Fixed a long-standing bug which could cause headings to be orphaned at the bottom of the page 

##  Layout

  * Added support for multi-column floating placement and figures via [ ` place.scope ` ](/docs/reference/layout/place/#parameters-scope "`place.scope`") and [ ` figure.scope ` ](/docs/reference/model/figure/#parameters-scope "`figure.scope`") . Two-column documents should now prefer ` set  page  (  columns  :  2  )  ` over ` show  :  column  .  with  (  2  )  ` (see the [ page setup guide ](/docs/guides/page-setup-guide/#columns) ). 
  * Added support for automatic [ line numbering ](/docs/reference/model/par/#definitions-line) (often used in academic papers) 
  * Added [ ` par.spacing ` ](/docs/reference/model/par/#parameters-spacing "`par.spacing`") property for configuring paragraph spacing. This should now be used instead of ` show  par  :  set  block  (  spacing  :  ..  )  ` **(Breaking change)**
  * Block-level elements like lists, grids, and stacks now show themselves as blocks and are thus affected by all block properties (e.g. ` stroke ` ) rather than just ` spacing ` **(Breaking change)**
  * Added [ ` block.sticky ` ](/docs/reference/layout/block/#parameters-sticky "`block.sticky`") property which prevents a page break after a block 
  * Added [ ` place.flush ` ](/docs/reference/layout/place/#definitions-flush "`place.flush`") function which forces all floating figures to be placed before any further content 
  * Added [ ` skew ` ](/docs/reference/layout/skew/ "`skew`") function 
  * Added ` auto  ` option for [ ` page.header ` ](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-header "`page.header`") and [ ` page.footer ` ](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-footer "`page.footer`") which results in an automatic header/footer based on the numbering (which was previously inaccessible after a change) 
  * Added ` gap ` and ` justify ` parameters to [ ` repeat ` ](/docs/reference/layout/repeat/ "`repeat`") function 
  * Added ` width ` and ` height ` parameters to the [ ` measure ` ](/docs/reference/layout/measure/ "`measure`") function to define the space in which the content should be measured. Especially useful in combination with [ ` layout ` ](/docs/reference/layout/layout/ "`layout`") . 
  * The height of a ` block ` , ` image ` , ` rect ` , ` square ` , ` ellipse ` , or ` circle ` can now be specified in [ fractional units ](/docs/reference/layout/fraction/)
  * The [ ` scale ` ](/docs/reference/layout/scale/ "`scale`") function now supports absolute lengths for ` x ` , ` y ` , ` factor ` . This way an element of unknown size can be scaled to a fixed size. 
  * The values of ` block.above ` and ` block.below ` can now be retrieved in context expressions. 
  * Increased accuracy of conversions between absolute units (pt, mm, cm, in) 
  * Fixed a bug which could cause headings to be orphaned at the bottom of the page 
  * Fixed footnotes within breakable blocks appearing on the page where the breakable block ends instead of at the page where the footnote marker is 
  * Fixed numbering of nested footnotes and footnotes in floats 
  * Fixed empty pages appearing when a [ context ](/docs/reference/context/ "context") expression wraps whole pages 
  * Fixed ` set  block  (  spacing  :  x  )  ` behaving differently from ` set  block  (  above  :  x  ,  below  :  x  )  `
  * Fixed behavior of [ ` rotate ` ](/docs/reference/layout/rotate/ "`rotate`") and [ ` scale ` ](/docs/reference/layout/scale/ "`scale`") with ` reflow:  true  `
  * Fixed interaction of ` align  (  horizon  )  ` and ` v  (  1fr  )  `
  * Fixed various bugs where floating placement would yield overlapping results 
  * Fixed a bug where widow/orphan prevention would unnecessarily move text into the next column 
  * Fixed [ weak spacing ](/docs/reference/layout/h/#parameters-weak) not being trimmed at the start and end of lines in a paragraph (only at the start and end of paragraphs) 
  * Fixed interaction of weak page break and [ ` pagebreak.to ` ](/docs/reference/layout/pagebreak/#parameters-to "`pagebreak.to`")
  * Fixed compilation output of a single weak page break 
  * Fixed crash when [ padding ](/docs/reference/layout/pad/) by ` 100%  `

##  Text

  * Tuned hyphenation: It is less eager by default and hyphenations close to the edges of words are now discouraged more strongly **(May lead to larger layout reflows)**
  * New default font: Libertinus Serif. This is the maintained successor to the old default font Linux Libertine. **(May lead to smaller reflows)**
  * Setting the font to an unavailable family will now result in a warning 
  * Implemented a new smart quote algorithm, fixing various bugs where smart quotes weren't all that smart 
  * Added [ ` text.costs ` ](/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-costs "`text.costs`") parameter for tweaking various parameters that affect the choices of the layout engine during text layout 
  * Added ` typm ` highlighting mode for math in [ raw blocks ](/docs/reference/text/raw/#parameters-lang)
  * Added basic i18n for Galician, Catalan, Latin, Icelandic, Hebrew 
  * Implemented hyphenation duplication for Czech, Croatian, Lower Sorbian, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, and Spanish. 
  * The [ ` smallcaps ` ](/docs/reference/text/smallcaps/ "`smallcaps`") function is now an element function and can thereby be used in show(-set) rules. 
  * The [ ` raw.theme ` ](/docs/reference/text/raw/#parameters-theme "`raw.theme`") parameter can now be set to ` none  ` to disable highlighting even in the presence of a language tag, and to ` auto  ` to reset to the default 
  * Multiple [ stylistic sets ](/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-stylistic-set) can now be enabled at once 
  * Fixed the Chinese translation for "Equation" 
  * Fixed that hyphenation could occur outside of words 
  * Fixed incorrect layout of bidirectional text in edge cases 
  * Fixed layout of paragraphs with explicit trailing whitespace 
  * Fixed bugs related to empty paragraphs created via ` #"" `
  * Fixed accidental trailing spaces for line breaks immediately preceding an inline equation 
  * Fixed [ ` text.historical-ligatures ` ](/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-historical-ligatures "`text.historical-ligatures`") not working correctly 
  * Fixed accidental repetition of Thai characters around line breaks in some circumstances 
  * Fixed [ smart quotes ](/docs/reference/text/smartquote/) for Swiss French 
  * New font metadata exceptions for Archivo, Kaiti SC, and Kaiti TC 
  * Updated bundled New Computer Modern fonts to version 6.0 

##  Math

  * Block-level equations can now break over multiple pages if enabled via ` show  math  .  equation  :  set  block  (  breakable  :  true  )  ` . 
  * Matrix and vector sizing is now more consistent across different cell contents 
  * Added [ ` stretch ` ](/docs/reference/math/stretch/) function for manually or automatically stretching characters like arrows or parentheses horizontally or vertically 
  * Improved layout of attachments on parenthesized as well as under- or overlined expressions 
  * Improved layout of nested attachments resulting from code like ` #  let  a0  =  $  a  _  0  $  ;  $  a0  ^  1  $  `
  * Improved layout of primes close to superscripts 
  * Improved layout of fractions 
  * Typst now makes use of math-specific height-dependent kerning information in some fonts for better attachment layout 
  * The ` floor ` and ` ceil ` functions in math are now callable symbols, such that ` $  floor  (  x  )  =  lr  (  floor  .  l  x  floor  .  r  )  $  `
  * The [ ` mat.delim ` ](/docs/reference/math/mat/#parameters-delim) , [ ` vec.delim ` ](/docs/reference/math/vec/#parameters-delim) , and [ ` cases.delim ` ](/docs/reference/math/cases/#parameters-delim) parameters now allow any character that is considered a delimiter or "fence" (e.g. |) by Unicode. The ` delim:  "||"  ` notation is _not_ supported anymore and should be replaced by ` delim: bar  .  double ` **(Minor breaking change)**
  * Added [ ` vec.align ` ](/docs/reference/math/vec/#parameters-align) and [ ` mat.align ` ](/docs/reference/math/mat/#parameters-align) parameters 
  * Added [ ` underparen ` ](/docs/reference/math/underover/#functions-underparen) , [ ` overparen ` ](/docs/reference/math/underover/#functions-overparen) , [ ` undershell ` ](/docs/reference/math/underover/#functions-undershell) , and [ ` overshell ` ](/docs/reference/math/underover/#functions-overshell)
  * Added ` ~ ` shorthand for ` tilde.op ` in math mode **(Minor breaking change)**
  * Fixed baseline alignment of equation numbers

  * Fixed baseline of large roots 
  * Fixed multiple minor layout bugs with attachments 
  * Fixed that alignment points could affect line height in math

  * Fixed a crash with recursive show rules in math 
  * Fixed [ ` lr.size ` ](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-lr-size) not affecting characters enclosed in [ ` mid ` ](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-mid) in some cases 
  * Fixed resolving of em units in sub- and superscripts 
  * Fixed bounding box of inline equations when a [ text edge ](/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-top-edge) is set to ` "bounds"  `

##  Introspection

  * Implemented a new system by which Typst tracks where elements end up on the pages. This may lead to subtly different behavior in introspections. **(Breaking change)**
  * Fixed various bugs with wrong counter behavior in complex layout situations, through a new, more principled implementation 
  * Counter updates can now be before the first, in between, and after the last page when isolated by weak page breaks. This allows, for instance, updating a counter before the first page header and background. 
  * Fixed logical ordering of introspections within footnotes and figures 
  * Fixed incorrect [ ` here().position() ` ](/docs/reference/introspection/here/) when [ ` place ` ](/docs/reference/layout/place/ "`place`") was used in a context expression 
  * Fixed resolved positions of elements (in particular, headings) whose show rule emits an invisible element (like a state update) before a page break 
  * Fixed behavior of stepping a counter at a deeper level than its current state has 
  * Fixed citation formatting not working in table headers and a few other places 
  * Displaying the footnote counter will now respect the footnote numbering style 

##  Model

  * Document set rules do not need to be at the very start of the document anymore. The only restriction is that they must not occur inside of layout containers. 
  * The ` spacing ` property of [ lists ](/docs/reference/model/list/#parameters-spacing) , [ enumerations ](/docs/reference/model/enum/#parameters-spacing) , and [ term lists ](/docs/reference/model/terms/#parameters-spacing) is now also respected for tight lists 
  * Tight lists now only attach (with tighter spacing) to preceding paragraphs, not arbitrary blocks 
  * The [ ` quote ` ](/docs/reference/model/quote/ "`quote`") element is now locatable (can be used in queries) 
  * The bibliography heading now uses ` depth ` instead of ` level ` so that its level can still be configured via a show-set rule 
  * Added support for more [ numbering ](/docs/reference/model/numbering/ "numbering") formats: Devanagari, Eastern Arabic, Bengali, and circled numbers 
  * Added [ ` hanging-indent ` ](/docs/reference/model/heading/#parameters-hanging-indent) parameter to heading function to tweak the appearance of multi-line headings and improved default appearance of multi-line headings 
  * Improved handling of bidirectional text in outline entry 
  * Fixed document set rules being ignored in an otherwise empty document 
  * Fixed document set rules not being usable in context expressions 
  * Fixed bad interaction between ` set  document ` and ` set  page `
  * Fixed ` show  figure  :  set  align  (  ..  )  ` . Since the default figure alignment is now a show-set rule, it is not revoked by ` show  figure  :  it  => it  .  body ` anymore. **(Minor breaking change)**
  * Fixed numbering of footnote references 
  * Fixed spacing after bibliography heading 

##  Bibliography

  * The Hayagriva YAML ` publisher ` field can now accept a dictionary with a ` location ` key. The top-level ` location ` key is now primarily intended for event and item locations. 
  * Multiple page ranges with prefixes and suffixes are now allowed 
  * Added ` director ` and catch-all editor types to BibLaTeX parsing 
  * Added support for disambiguation to alphanumeric citation style

  * Fixed color mixing and gradients for [ Luma colors ](/docs/reference/visualize/color/#definitions-luma)
  * Fixed conversion from Luma to CMYK colors 
  * Fixed offset gradient strokes in PNG export 
  * Fixed unintended cropping of some SVGs 
  * SVGs with foreign objects now produce a warning as they will likely not render correctly in Typst 

##  Syntax

  * Added support for nested imports like ` import  "file.typ"  :  module  .  item `
  * Added support for parenthesized imports like ` import  "file.typ"  :  (  a  ,  b  ,  c  )  ` . With those, the import list can break over multiple lines. 
  * Fixed edge case in parsing of reference syntax 
  * Fixed edge case in parsing of heading, list, enum, and term markers immediately followed by comments 
  * Fixed rare crash in parsing of parenthesized expressions 

##  Scripting

  * Added new fixed-point [ ` decimal ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/decimal/ "`decimal`") number type for highly precise arithmetic on numbers in base 10, as needed for finance 
  * Added ` std ` module for accessing standard library definitions even when a variable with the same name shadows/overwrites it 
  * Added [ ` array.to-dict ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-to-dict "`array.to-dict`") , [ ` array.reduce ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-reduce "`array.reduce`") , [ ` array.windows ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-windows "`array.windows`") methods 
  * Added ` exact ` argument to [ ` array.zip ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-zip "`array.zip`")
  * Added [ ` arguments.at ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/arguments/#definitions-at "`arguments.at`") method 
  * Added [ ` int.from-bytes ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/int/#definitions-from-bytes "`int.from-bytes`") , [ ` int.to-bytes ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/int/#definitions-to-bytes "`int.to-bytes`") , [ ` float.from-bytes ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/float/#definitions-from-bytes "`float.from-bytes`") , and [ ` float.to-bytes ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/float/#definitions-to-bytes "`float.to-bytes`")
  * Added proper support for negative values of the ` digits ` parameter of [ ` calc.round ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-round "`calc.round`") (the behaviour existed before but was subtly broken) 
  * Conversions from [ ` int ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/int/ "`int`") to [ ` float ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/float/ "`float`") will now error instead of saturating if the float is too large **(Minor breaking change)**
  * Added ` float.nan ` and ` float.inf ` , removed ` calc.nan ` **(Minor breaking change)**
  * Certain symbols are now generally callable like functions and not only specifically in math. Examples are accents or [ ` floor ` ](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-floor) and [ ` ceil ` ](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-ceil) . 
  * Improved [ ` repr ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/repr/ "`repr`") of relative values, sequences, infinities, NaN, ` type  (  none  )  ` and ` type  (  auto  )  `
  * Fixed crash on whole packages (rather than just files) cyclically importing each other 
  * Fixed return type of [ ` calc.round ` ](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-round "`calc.round`") on integers when a non-zero value is provided for ` digits `

##  Styling

  * Text show rules now match across multiple text elements 
  * The string ` " ` in a text show rule now matches smart quotes 
  * Fixed a long-standing styling bug where the header and footer would incorrectly inherit styles from a lone element on the page (e.g. a heading) 
  * Fixed ` set  page ` not working directly after a counter/state update 
  * Page fields configured via an explicit ` page  (  ..  )  [  ..  ]  ` call can now be properly retrieved in context expressions 

##  Export

  * Highly reduced PDF file sizes due to better font subsetting 
  * Emoji are now exported properly in PDF 
  * Added initial support for PDF/A. For now, only the standard PDF/A-2b is supported, but more is planned for the future. Enabled via ` --pdf-standard a-2b ` in the CLI and via the UI in File > Export as > PDF in the web app. 
  * Setting [ ` page.fill ` ](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-fill "`page.fill`") to ` none  ` will now lead to transparent pages instead of white ones in PNG and SVG. The new default of ` auto  ` means transparent for PDF and white for PNG and SVG. 
  * Improved text copy-paste from PDF in complex scenarios 
  * Exported SVGs now contain the ` data-typst-label ` attribute on groups resulting from labelled [ boxes ](/docs/reference/layout/box/) and [ blocks ](/docs/reference/layout/block/)
  * Fixed a bug where some fonts would not print correctly on professional printers 
  * Fixed a bug where transparency could leak from one PDF object to another 
  * Fixed a bug with CMYK gradients in PDF 
  * Fixed various bugs with export of Oklab gradients in PDF 
  * Fixed crashes related to rendering of non-outline glyphs 
  * Two small fixes for PDF standard conformance 

##  Performance

  * Typst's layout engine is now multithreaded. Typical speedups are 2-3x for larger documents. The multithreading operates on page break boundaries, so explicit page breaks are necessary for it to kick in. 
  * Paragraph justification was optimized with a new two-pass algorithm. Speedups are larger for shorter paragraphs and range from 1-6x. 

##  Command Line Interface

  * Added ` --pages ` option to select specific page ranges to export 
  * Added ` --package-path ` and ` --package-cache-path ` as well as ` TYPST_PACKAGE_PATH ` and ` TYPST_PACKAGE_CACHE_PATH ` environment variables for configuring where packages are loaded from and cached in, respectively 
  * Added ` --ignore-system-fonts ` flag to disable system fonts fully for better reproducibility 
  * Added ` --make-deps ` argument for outputting the dependencies of the current compilation as a Makefile 
  * Added ` --pretty ` option to ` typst query ` , with the default now being to minify (only applies to JSON format) 
  * Added ` --backup-path ` to ` typst update ` to configure where the previous version is backed up 
  * Added useful links to help output 
  * The CLI will now greet users who invoke just ` typst ` for the first time 
  * The document can now be written to stdout by passing ` - ` as the output filename (for PDF or single-page image export) 
  * Typst will now emit a proper error message instead of failing silently when the certificate specified by ` --cert ` or ` TYPST_CERT ` could not be loaded 
  * The CLI now respects the ` SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH ` environment variable for better reproducibility 
  * When exporting multiple images, you can now use ` t ` (total pages), ` p ` (current page), and ` 0p ` (zero-padded current page, same as current ` n ` ) in the output path 
  * The input and output paths now allow non-UTF-8 values 
  * Times are now formatted more consistently across the CLI 
  * Fixed a bug related to the ` --open ` flag 
  * Fixed path completions for ` typst ` not working in zsh
