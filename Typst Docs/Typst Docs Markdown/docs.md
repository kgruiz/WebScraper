#  Overview

Welcome to Typst's documentation! Typst is a new markup-based typesetting
system for the sciences. It is designed to be an alternative both to advanced
tools like LaTeX and simpler tools like Word and Google Docs. Our goal with
Typst is to build a typesetting tool that is highly capable _and_ a pleasure
to use.

This documentation is split into two parts: A beginner-friendly tutorial that
introduces Typst through a practical use case and a comprehensive reference
that explains all of Typst's concepts and features.

We also invite you to join the community we're building around Typst. Typst is
still a very young project, so your feedback is more than valuable.
