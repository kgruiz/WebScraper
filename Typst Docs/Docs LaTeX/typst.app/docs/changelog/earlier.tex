\href{https://typst.app/blog/2023/january-update}{Go to the announcement
blog post.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  New expression syntax in markup/math

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Blocks cannot be directly embedded in markup anymore
  \item
    Like other expressions, they now require a leading hash
  \item
    More expressions available with hash, including literals (
    \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "string"\ }}\texttt{\ }
    ) as well as field access and method call without space:
    \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ emoji\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ .\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ face\ }}\texttt{\ }
  \end{itemize}
\item
  New import syntax

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ import\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "module.typ"\ }}\texttt{\ }
    creates binding named \texttt{\ module\ }
  \item
    \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ import\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "module.typ"\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ a\ }{\texttt{\ ,\ }}\texttt{\ b\ }
    or
    \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ import\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "module.typ"\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ *\ }}\texttt{\ }
    to import items
  \item
    \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ import\ }}\texttt{\ emoji\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ face\ }{\texttt{\ ,\ }}\texttt{\ turtle\ }
    to import from already bound module
  \end{itemize}
\item
  New symbol handling

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Removed symbol notation
  \item
    Symbols are now in modules: \texttt{\ sym\ } , \texttt{\ emoji\ } ,
    and \texttt{\ math\ }
  \item
    Math module also reexports all of \texttt{\ sym\ }
  \item
    Modified through field access, still order-independent
  \item
    Unknown modifiers are not allowed anymore
  \item
    Support for custom symbol definitions with \texttt{\ symbol\ }
    function
  \item
    Symbols now listed in documentation
  \end{itemize}
\item
  New \texttt{\ math\ } module

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Contains all math-related functions
  \item
    Variables and function calls directly in math (without hash) access
    this module instead of the global scope, but can also access local
    variables
  \item
    Can be explicitly used in code, e.g.
    \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ set\ }}\texttt{\ math\ }{\texttt{\ .\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ vec\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ delim\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "{[}"\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Delimiter matching in math

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Any opening delimiters matches any closing one
  \item
    When matched, they automatically scale
  \item
    To prevent scaling, escape them
  \item
    To forcibly match two delimiters, use \texttt{\ lr\ } function
  \item
    Line breaks may occur between matched delimiters
  \item
    Delimiters may also be unbalanced
  \item
    You can also use the \texttt{\ lr\ } function to scale the brackets
    (or just one bracket) to a specific size manually
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Multi-line math with alignment

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The \texttt{\ \textbackslash{}\ } character inserts a line break
  \item
    The \texttt{\ \&\ } character defines an alignment point
  \item
    Alignment points also work for underbraces, vectors, cases, and
    matrices
  \item
    Multiple alignment points are supported
  \end{itemize}
\item
  More capable math function calls

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Function calls directly in math can now take code expressions with
    hash
  \item
    They can now also take named arguments
  \item
    Within math function calls, semicolons turn preceding arguments to
    arrays to support matrices:
    \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \$\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ mat\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ 1\ }{\texttt{\ ,\ }}\texttt{\ 2\ }{\texttt{\ ;\ }}\texttt{\ 3\ }{\texttt{\ ,\ }}\texttt{\ 4\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \$\ }}\texttt{\ }
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Arbitrary content in math

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Text, images, and other arbitrary content can now be embedded in
    math
  \item
    Math now also supports font fallback to support e.g. CJK and emoji
  \end{itemize}
\item
  More math features

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    New text operators: \texttt{\ op\ } function, \texttt{\ lim\ } ,
    \texttt{\ max\ } , etc.
  \item
    New matrix function: \texttt{\ mat\ }
  \item
    New n-ary roots with \texttt{\ root\ } function:
    \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \$\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ root\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ 3\ }{\texttt{\ ,\ }}\texttt{\ x\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \$\ }}\texttt{\ }
  \item
    New under- and overbraces, -brackets, and -lines
  \item
    New \texttt{\ abs\ } and \texttt{\ norm\ } functions
  \item
    New shorthands: \texttt{\ {[}\textbar{}\ } ,
    \texttt{\ \textbar{}{]}\ } , and \texttt{\ \textbar{}\textbar{}\ }
  \item
    New \texttt{\ attach\ } function, overridable attachments with
    \texttt{\ script\ } and \texttt{\ limit\ }
  \item
    Manual spacing in math, with \texttt{\ h\ } , \texttt{\ thin\ } ,
    \texttt{\ med\ } , \texttt{\ thick\ } and \texttt{\ quad\ }
  \item
    Symbols and other content may now be used like a function, e.g.
    \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \$\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ zeta\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ x\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \$\ }}\texttt{\ }
  \item
    Added Fira Math font, removed Noto Sans Math font
  \item
    Support for alternative math fonts through
    \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \#\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ show\ }}\texttt{\ math\ }{\texttt{\ .\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ formula\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ :\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ set\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ text\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "Fira\ Math"\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }
  \end{itemize}
\item
  More library improvements

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    New \texttt{\ calc\ } module, \texttt{\ abs\ } , \texttt{\ min\ } ,
    \texttt{\ max\ } , \texttt{\ even\ } , \texttt{\ odd\ } and
    \texttt{\ mod\ } moved there
  \item
    New \texttt{\ message\ } argument on \texttt{\ assert\ } function
  \item
    The \texttt{\ pairs\ } method on dictionaries now returns an array
    of length-2 arrays instead of taking a closure
  \item
    The method call
    \texttt{\ dict\ }{\texttt{\ .\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ at\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "key"\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }
    now always fails if \texttt{\ "key"\ } doesn\textquotesingle t exist
    Previously, it was allowed in assignments. Alternatives are
    \texttt{\ dict\ }{\texttt{\ .\ }}\texttt{\ key\ }{\texttt{\ =\ }}\texttt{\ x\ }
    and
    \texttt{\ dict\ }{\texttt{\ .\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ insert\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ (\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "key"\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ ,\ }}\texttt{\ x\ }{\texttt{\ )\ }}\texttt{\ }
    .
