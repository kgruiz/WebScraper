     Hey and welcome to the Community page! We're so glad you're here. Typst is developed by an early-stage startup and it is still early days, but it would be pointless without people like you who are interested in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     We would love to not only hear from you but to also provide spaces where you can discuss any topic around Typst, typesetting, writing, the sciences, and typography with other likeminded people.
    </p>

     <strong>
      Our
      <a href="https://forum.typst.app/">
       Forum
      </a>
      is the best place to get answers for questions on Typst and to show off your creations.
     </strong>
     If you would like to chat with the community and shape the future development of Typst, we would like to also invite you to our
     <a href="https://discord.gg/2uDybryKPe">

     . We coordinate our Open-Source work there, but you can also iterate on Typst projects and discuss off-topic things with the community members. Both the Forum and the Discord server are open for everyone. Of course, you are also very welcome to connect with us on social media (
