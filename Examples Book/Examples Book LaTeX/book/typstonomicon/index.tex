Write}}{Typstonomicon, or The Code You Should Not Write}}\label{typstonomicon-or-the-code-you-should-not-write}

Totally cursed examples with lots of quires, measure and other things to
hack around current Typst limitations. Generally you should use this
code only if you really need it.

Code in this chapter may break in lots of circumstances and debugging it
will be very painful. You are warned.

I think that this chapter will slowly die as Typst matures.
