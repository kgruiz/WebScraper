You can exclude elements by name (e.g.,
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ "caption"\ }}\texttt{\ } ), function (e.g.,
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ figure.caption\ }}\texttt{\ } ), where-selector
(e.g., \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ raw.where(block:\ true)\ }}\texttt{\ } ),
or \texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ label\ }}\texttt{\ } (e.g.,
\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \textless{}\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ no-wc\ }}\texttt{\ }{\texttt{\ \textgreater{}\ }}\texttt{\ }
).

\begin{verbatim}
#import "@preview/wordometer:0.1.0": word-count, total-words

#show: word-count.with(exclude: (heading.where(level: 1), strike))

= This Heading Doesn't Count
== But I do!

In this document #strike[(excluding me)], there are #total-words words all up.

#word-count(total => [
  You can exclude elements by label, too.
  #[That was #total-words, excluding this sentence!] <no-wc>
], exclude: <no-wc>)
