#  Packages

Once the [ Typst Universe ](https://typst.app/universe) was launched, this
chapter has become almost redundant. The Universe is actually a very cool
place to look for packages.

However, there are still some cool examples of interesting package usage.

##  General

Typst has packages, but, unlike LaTeX, you need to remember:

  * You need them only for some specialized tasks, basic formatting _can be totally done without them_ . 
  * Packages are much lighter and much easier "installed" than LaTeX ones. 
  * Packages are just plain Typst files (and sometimes plugins), so you can easily write your own! 

To use mighty package, just write, like this:

    
    
    #import "@preview/cetz:0.1.2": canvas, plot
    
    #canvas(length: 1cm, {
      plot.plot(size: (8, 6),
        x-tick-step: none,
        x-ticks: ((-calc.pi, $-pi$), (0, $0$), (calc.pi, $pi$)),
        y-tick-step: 1,
        {
          plot.add(
            style: plot.palette.blue,
            domain: (-calc.pi, calc.pi), x => calc.sin(x * 1rad))
          plot.add(
            hypograph: true,
            style: plot.palette.blue,
            domain: (-calc.pi, calc.pi), x => calc.cos(x * 1rad))
          plot.add(
            hypograph: true,
            style: plot.palette.blue,
            domain: (-calc.pi, calc.pi), x => calc.cos((x + calc.pi) * 1rad))
        })
    })

If you are author of a package or just want to make a fair overview, feel free
to make issues/PR-s!
