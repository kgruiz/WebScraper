#  Typst Examples Book

This book provides an extended _tutorial_ and lots of [ Typst
](https://github.com/typst/typst) snippets that can help you to write better
Typst code.

This is an unofficial book. Some snippets & suggestions here may be outdated
or useless (please let me know if you find some).

However, _all of them should compile on last version of Typst 1  _ .

**CAUTION:** the book is (probably forever) a **WIP** , so don't rely on it.

If you like it, consider [ giving a star on GitHub
](https://github.com/sitandr/typst-examples-book) !

This will help me to stay motivated and continue working on this book.

##  Navigation

The book consists of several chapters, each with its own goal:

  1. [ Typst Basics ](./basics/index.html)
  2. [ Typst Snippets ](./snippets/index.html)
  3. [ Typst Packages ](./packages/index.html)
  4. [ Typstonomicon ](./typstonomicon/index.html)

##  Contributions

Any contributions are very welcome! If you have a good code snippet that you
want to share, feel free to submit an issue with snippet or make a PR in the [
repository ](https://github.com/sitandr/typst-examples-book) .

I will especially appreciate submissions of active community members and
compiler contributors!

However, I will also really appreciate feedback from beginners to make the
book as comprehensible as possible!

##  Acknowledgements
