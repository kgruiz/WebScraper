#  States & Query

This section is outdated. It may be still useful, but it is strongly
recommended to study new context system (using the reference).

Typst tries to be a _pure language_ as much as possible.

That means, a function can't change anything outside of it. That also means,
if you call function, the result should be always the same.

Unfortunately, our world (and therefore our documents) isn't pure. If you
create a heading â„–2, you want the next number to be three.

That section will guide you to using impure Typst. Don't overuse it, as this
knowledge comes close to the Dark Arts of Typst!
