\section{thesist}\label{thesist}

{ 0.2.0 }

A Master\textquotesingle s thesis template for Instituto Superior
TÃ©cnico (IST)

\href{/app?template=thesist&version=0.2.0}{Create project in app}

\phantomsection\label{readme}
ThesIST (pronounced â€œdesistâ€?) is an unofficial Masterâ€™s thesis
template for Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico written in Typst.

This template fully meets the official formatting requirements as
outlined
\href{https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/files/2021/09/guia-disserta-o-mestrado.pdf}{here}
, and also attempts to follow most unwritten conventions. Regardless,
you can be on the lookout for things you may want to see added.

PIC2 reports are also supported. However, some conventions for these may
vary with the supervisors, so please check with them if anything needs
to be changed.

\subsection{Changelogs}\label{changelogs}

The changelogs of new versions are available on
\href{https://github.com/tfachada/thesist/releases}{the Releases page} .
Make sure to check the latest one(s) whenever you update the imported
\texttt{\ thesist\ } version.

\subsection{Usage}\label{usage}

If you are in the Typst web app, simply click on â€œStart from
templateâ€? and pick this template.

If you want to develop locally:

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Make sure you have the \textbf{TeX Gyre Heros} font family installed.
\item
  Install the package with \texttt{\ typst\ init\ @preview/thesist\ } .
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview}

\textbf{Please read the â€œQuick guideâ€? chapter included in this
template to get set up. You can keep it as a reference if you want.}

This templateâ€™s source files, hidden from the user view, are the
following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{\ layout.typ\ } : The main configuration file, which
  initializes the thesis and contains its general formatting rules.
\item
  \texttt{\ figure-numbering.typ\ } : This file contains a function to
  set a chapter-relative numbering for the various types of figures. The
  function is called once or twice depending on whether the user decides
  to include appendices.
\item
  \texttt{\ utils.typ\ } : General functions that you may want to import
  and use for QoL improvements.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{A sidenote about
subfigures}\label{a-sidenote-about-subfigures}

Since subfigures are not yet native to Typst, the current
implementation, present in \texttt{\ utils.typ\ } , needs the user to
manually input whether each called subfigure figure (aka subfigure grid)
is in an appendix or not. This is because the numbering is different in
appendices, and because the functionality of
\texttt{\ figure-numbering.typ\ } canâ€™t be applied to subfigure grids,
since they are imported with their default numbering once in every
chapter. \texttt{\ context\ } expressions also donâ€™t work across
imports, so location within the document couldnâ€™t be used as a
parameter (unless the user called \texttt{\ context\ } themselves, which
would be unintuitive). \textbf{Regardless, the workaround that was
found, which is explained in the quick guide, doesnâ€™t need much
thinking from the user, so you can see this as a more technical note
that shouldnâ€™t matter when youâ€™re writing the thesis.}
