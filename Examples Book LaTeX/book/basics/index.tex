This is a chapter that consistently introduces you to the most things
you need to know when writing with Typst.

It show much more things than official tutorial, so maybe it will be
interesting to read for some of the experienced users too.

Some examples are taken from
\href{https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/}{Official Tutorial} and
\href{https://typst.app/docs/reference/}{Official Reference} . Most are
created and edited specially for this book.

\emph{Important:} in most cases there will be used "clipped" examples of
your rendered documents (no margins, smaller width and so on).

To set up the spacing as you want, see
\href{https://typst.app/docs/guides/page-setup-guide/}{Official Page
Setup Guide} .
