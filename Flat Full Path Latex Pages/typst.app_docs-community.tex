\section{Community}\label{community}

Hey and welcome to the Community page! We\textquotesingle re so glad
you\textquotesingle re here. Typst is developed by an early-stage
startup and it is still early days, but it would be pointless without
people like you who are interested in it.

We would love to not only hear from you but to also provide spaces where
you can discuss any topic around Typst, typesetting, writing, the
sciences, and typography with other likeminded people.

\textbf{Our \href{https://forum.typst.app/}{Forum} is the best place to
get answers for questions on Typst and to show off your creations.} If
you would like to chat with the community and shape the future
development of Typst, we would like to also invite you to our
\href{https://discord.gg/2uDybryKPe}{Discord server} . We coordinate our
Open-Source work there, but you can also iterate on Typst projects and
discuss off-topic things with the community members. Both the Forum and
the Discord server are open for everyone. Of course, you are also very
welcome to connect with us on social media (
\href{https://mastodon.social/@typst}{Mastodon} ,
\href{https://bsky.app/profile/typst.app}{Bluesky} ,
\href{https://instagram.com/typstapp/}{Instagram} ,
\href{https://linkedin.com/company/typst}{LinkedIn} , and
\href{https://github.com/typst}{GitHub} ).

\subsection{What to share?}\label{what-to-share}

For our community, we want to foster versatility and inclusivity. You
are welcome to post about any topic that you think would interest other
community members, but if you need a little inspiration, here are a few
ideas:

\begin{itemize}

  any unique or creative ways you\textquotesingle ve used the platform
\item
  Share importable files or templates that you use to style your
  documents

occur at any point. The compiler is developed in the open on
