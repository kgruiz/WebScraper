      abstract: [
        Recent advances in space-based document processing have enabled faster mail delivery between different planets of a solar system. Given the time it takes for a message to be transmitted from one planet to the next, its estimated that even a one-way trip to a distant destination could take up to one year. During these periods of interplanetary mail delivery there is a slight possibility of mail being lost in transit. This issue is considered so serious that space management employs P.I. agents to track down and retrieve lost mail. We propose A-Mail, a new anti-matter based approach that can ensure that mail loss occurring during interplanetary transit is unobservable and therefore potentially undetectable. Going even further, we extend A-Mail to predict problems and apply existing and new best practices to ensure the mail is delivered without any issues. We call this extension AI-Mail.
