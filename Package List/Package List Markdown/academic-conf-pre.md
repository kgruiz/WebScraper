#  academic-conf-pre

0.1.0

Slide Theme for Acadmic Presentations in Australia

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=academic-conf-pre&version=0.1.0)

##  1\. Introduction

This is a template for **academic conference presentations** . It is designed
for the use in Typst which is simplier and more user-friendly than LaTeX.

##  2\. How to use this template

themes documents are under **/themes/**

examples documents are under **/examples/**

if you donât want to redesign the template, just follow the typ files under
the examples.

##  3\. How it looks

The colors are entirely controllable, and I have provided three relatively
comfortable color schemes with **green** , **blue** , and **red** as the base
tones, which can be easily adjusted.

It is notable, there is a logo displayed in the center of the presentation,
and its **appearance** , **transparency** , and **position** can be fully
adjusted. Here, I use the University of Sydneyâs logo as an example.

You could see the PDFs under **examples/xxx.pdf**
