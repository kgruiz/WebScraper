#  scrutinize

0.3.0

A library for building exams, tests, etc. with Typst

Scrutinize is a library for building exams, tests, etc. with Typst. It has
three general areas of focus:

  * It helps with grading information: record the points that can be reached for each question and make them available for creating grading keys. 
  * It provides a selection of question writing utilities, such as multiple choice or true/false questions. 
  * It supports the creation of sample solutions by allowing to switch between the normal and âpre-filledâ exam. 

Right now, providing a styled template is not part of this packageâs scope.
Also, visual customization of the provided question templates is currently
nonexistent.

See the [ manual
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scrutinize/0.3.0/docs/manual.pdf)
for details.
