#  october

1.0.0

Simple printable year calendar

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=october&version=1.0.0)

This template generates a monthly calendar, designed to be printed in
landscape.

The calendar function accepts one parameter for the year, which should be
formatted as an integer. Otherwise, the current year can be passed in with `
datetime.today().year() ` .

    
    
     #show: calendar.with(
      year: datetime.today().year()
    )
    

There isnât much space for writing in each day box, itâs more suited to
blocking out days with a highlighter. For example, to mark out free days in a
variable schedule of work shifts.
