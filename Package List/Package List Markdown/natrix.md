#  natrix

0.1.0

Natural and consistent matrix for typst.

![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/natrix/0.1.0/natrix.svg)

` natrix.nat ` is a drop-in replacement for ` mat ` with some additional
features. ` nat ` ensures that each row in your matrix should have the similar
height, unless one of them becomes too tall.

At this moment, it is recommended to use ` nat ` only in display equations,
but not in inline equations. This is because ` nat ` looks a little bit off
when used in inline equations.
