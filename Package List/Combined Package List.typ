Awesome Glossary for Typst.

Automatically create a glossary in [ typst ](https://typst.app/) .

This typst component creates a glossary page from a given pool of potential
glossary entries using only those entries, that are marked with the ` gls ` or
` gls-add ` functions in the document.

â ï¸ Typst is in beta and evolving, and this package evolves with it. As a
result, no backward compatibility is guaranteed yet. Also, the package itself
is under development and fine-tuning.

==  Usage

===  Marking the Entries

To include a term into the glossary, it can be marked with the ` gls `
function. The simplest form is like this:



    This is how to mark something for the glossary in #gls[Typst].


The function will render as defined with the specified show rule (see below!).

===  Controlling the Show

To control, how the markers are rendered in the document, a show rule has to
be defined. It usually looks like the following:



    // marker display : this rule makes the glossary marker in the document visible.
    #show figure.where(kind: "jkrb_glossary"): it => {it.body}


===  Hiding Entries from the Glossary Page

It is also possible to hide entries (temporarily) from the generated glossary
page without removing any markers for them from the document.

The following sample will hide the entries for âAmaranthâ and
âButterscotchâ from the glossary, even if it is marked with ` gls[...] `
or ` gls-add[...] ` somewhere in the document.



        #let hidden-entries = (
            "Amaranth",
            "Butterscotch"
        )

        #make-glossary(glossary-pool, excluded: hidden-entries)


===  Pool of Entries

A âpool of entriesâ is a typst dictionary. It can be read from a file or
may be the result of other operations.

One or more pool(s) are then given to the ` make-glossary() ` function. This
will create a glossary page of all referenced entries. If given more than one
pool, the order pools are searched in the order they are given to the method.
The first match wins. This can be used to have a global pool to be used in
different documents, and another one for local usage only.

The pool consists of a dictionary of definition entries. The key of an entry
is the term. Note, that it is case-sensitive. Each entry itself is also a
dictionary, and its main key is ` description ` . This is the content for the
term. There may be other keys in an entry in the future. For now, it supports:

  - description
  - link

An entry in the pool for the term âEngineâ file may look like this:



        Engine: (
            description: [

                In the context of software, an engine...

            ],
            link: [

                (1) Software engine - Wikipedia.
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engine
                (13.5.2023).

            ]
        ),


===  Unknown Entries

If the document marks a term that is not contained in the pool, an entry will
be generated anyway, but it will be visually marked as missing. This is
convenient for the workflow, where one can mark the desired entries while
writing the document, and provide missing entries later.

There is a parameter for the ` make-glossary() ` function named ` missing ` ,
where a function can be provided to format or even suppress the missing
entries.

===  Creating the Glossary Page

To create the glossary page, provide the pool of potential entries to the
make-glossary function. The following listing shows a complete sample document
with a glossary. The sample glossary pool is contained in the main document as
well:



        #import "@preview/gloss-awe:0.0.5": *

        // Text settings
        #set text(font: ("Arial", "Trebuchet MS"), size: 12pt)

        // Defining the Glossary Pool with definitions.
        #let glossary-pool = (

                    by referencing the label `<Glossary>`.

                ]
            ),

                    terms used in a document and to agree on a common definition of those terms. A
                    well-defined glossary can be very helpful in documents where very specific

        = My Sample Document with `gloss-awe`

        In this document the usage of the `gloss-awe` package is demonstrated to create a glossary
        with the help of a simple and small sample glossary pool. We have defined the pool in a
        dictionary named #gls[Glossary Pool] above. It contains the definitions the `gloss-awe`
        can use to build the glossary in the #gls[Glossary] section of this document. The pool
        could also come from external files, like #gls[JSON] or #gls[XML] or other sources. Only
        those definitions are shown in the glossary, that are marked in this document with one of
        the #gls(entry: "Marker")[marker] functions `gloss-awe` provides.

        If a Word is marked, that is not in the Glossary Pool, it gets a special markup in the
        resulting glossary, making it easy for the Author to spot the missing information an
        providing a definition. In this sample, there is no definition for "JSON" provided,
        resulting in an Entry with a red remark "#text(fill: red)[No~glossary~entry]".

        There is also a way to include Entries in the glossary for Words that are not contained in
        the documents text:

        #gls-add("Cloud")
        #gls-add("REST")


        = Glossary <Glossary>

        This section contains the generated Glossary, in a nice two-column-layout. It also bears a
        label, to enable the linking from marked words to the glossary.

        #line(length: 100%)
        #set text(font: ("Arial", "Trebuchet MS"), size: 10pt)
        #columns(2)[
            #make-glossary(glossary-pool)
        ]

](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

[ Typst ](https://typst.app/home/) thesis template for mathematical theses
built for simple, efficient use and a clean look. Of course, it can also be
used for other subjects, but the following math-specific features are already
contained in the template:

  - theorems, lemmas, corollaries, proofs etc. prepared using [ great-theorems ](https://typst.app/universe/package/great-theorems)
  - equation settings (using either [ equate ](https://typst.app/universe/package/equate) for numbering of subequations or [ i-figured ](https://typst.app/universe/package/i-figured/) for equation numbering which includes the chapter number)
  - pseudocode package [ lovelace ](https://typst.app/universe/package/lovelace) included.

Additionally, it has headers built with [ hydra
](https://typst.app/universe/package/hydra) .

==  Set-Up

The template is already filled with dummy data, to give users an [ impression
how it looks like ](https://github.com/sebaseb98/clean-math-
thesis/blob/main/template/main.pdf) . The thesis is obtained by compiling `
main.typ ` .

  - after [ installing Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) you can conveniently use the following to create a new folder containing this project.



    typst init @preview/clean-math-thesis:0.2.0


  - edit the data in ` main.typ ` â ` #show template.with([your data]) `

===  Parameters of the Template

personal/subject related information

  - ` author ` : Name of the author of the thesis.
  - ` title ` : Title of the thesis.
  - ` supervisor1 ` : Name of the first supervisor.
  - ` supervisor2 ` : Name of the second supervisor.
  - ` degree ` : Degree for which the thesis is submitted.
  - ` program ` : Program under which the thesis is submitted.
  - ` university ` : Name of the university.
  - ` institute ` : Name of the institute.
  - ` deadline ` : Submission deadline of the thesis.

file paths for logos etc.

  - ` uni-logo ` : Image, e.g. ` image("images/logo_placeholder.svg", width: 50%) `
  - ` institute-logo ` : Image.

formatting settings

  - ` citation-style ` : Citation style to be used in the thesis.
  - ` body-font ` : Font to be used for the body text.
  - ` cover-font ` : Font to be used for the cover text.

content that needs to be placed differently then normal chapters

  - ` abstract ` : Content for the abstract section.

equation settings

  - ` equate-settings ` : either none -> use i-figured; or tuple with the settings for the equations (see [ docs ](https://typst.app/universe/package/equate) ), e.g. (breakable: true, sub-numbering: true, number-mode: âlabelâ) The switching between these is currently not optimal: i-figured needs a prefix ( ` eq: ` ) so if we label an equation like ` <equation> ` the corresponding reference is ` @eq:equation ` and for equate we donât have this prefix, i.e. the reference would be ` @equation ` in this example. This is something to be improved in future releases.
  - ` equation-numbering-pattern ` : specify the [ numbering ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/numbering/#parameters-numbering) of the equations. The second counting symbol (e.g. the ` a ` in ` "(1.a)" ` ) is either used for subequation numbering or for the numbering of equations in the chapters.  colors
  - ` cover-color ` : Color used for the cover.
  - ` heading-color ` : Color used for headings.
  - ` link-color ` : Color used for links and references.

===  Other Customizations

  - ` declaration.typ ` should be modified
  - when adding chapters, remember to include them into the ` main.typ ` .
  - (optional) change colors and appearance of the theorem environment in the ` customization/ ` -folder.

===  Use of the template in existing projects

If you want to change an existing typst project structure to use this
template, just type the following lines



    #import "@preview/clean-math-thesis:0.1.0": template

advance if it fulfills all requirements. If not, this template might still be
a good starting point.

==  Acknowledgements

As inspiration on how to structure this template, we used the [ modern-unito-
thesis ](https://typst.app/universe/package/modern-unito-thesis) template. The
design is inspired by the [ fau-book ](https://github.com/FAU-AMMN/fau-book)
template.

0.1.0

Write Chinese pinyin easily.

Write Chinese pinyin easily.

==  Usage

Import the package:



    #import "@preview/easy-pinyin:0.1.0": pinyin, zhuyin


With the ` pinyin ` function, you can use ` a2 ` to write an ` ÉÌ ` , ` o3 `
to write an ` Ç ` , ` v4 ` to represent ` Ç ` , etc.

With ` zhuyin ` functionï¼you can put pinyin above the text easily, with
parameters:

  - positional parameters:
    - ` doc: content|string ` : main characters
    - ` ruby: content|string ` : zhuyin characters
  - named parameters:
    - ` scale: number = 0.7 ` : font size scale of ` ruby ` , default ` 0.7 `
    - ` gutter: length = 0.3em ` : spacing between ` doc ` and ` ruby ` , default ` 0.3em `
    - ` delimiter: string|none = none ` : if not none, use this character to split ` doc ` and ` ruby ` into parts
    - ` spacing: length|none = none ` : spacing between each parts

See example bellow.

==  Example



    æ±ï¼#pinyin[ha4n]ï¼è¯­ï¼#pinyin[yu3]ï¼æ¼ï¼#pinyin[pi1n]ï¼é³ï¼#pinyin[yi1n]ï¼ã

0.3.0

Algorithms in pseudocode, unopinionated and flexible

Featured  Package

This is a package for writing pseudocode in [ Typst ](https://typst.app/) . It
is named after the computer science pioneer [ Ada Lovelace
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) and inspired by the [ pseudo
package ](https://ctan.org/pkg/pseudo) for LaTeX.

![GitHub
license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/andreasKroepelin/lovelace)
![GitHub release \(latest by
date\)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/andreasKroepelin/lovelace)
![GitHub Repo
stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/andreasKroepelin/lovelace)

Pseudocode is not a programming language, it doesnât have strict syntax, so
you should be able to write it however you need to in your specific situation.
Lovelace lets you do exactly that.

Main features include:

  - arbitrary keywords and syntax structures
  - optional line numbering
  - line labels
  - lots of customisation with sensible defaults

==  Usage

  - [ Getting started ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#getting-started)
  - [ Lower level interface ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#lower-level-interface)
  - [ Line numbers ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#line-numbers)
  - [ Referencing lines ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#referencing-lines)
  - [ Indentation guides ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#indentation-guides)
  - [ Spacing ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#spacing)
  - [ Decorations ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#decorations)
  - [ Algorithm as figure ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#algorithm-as-figure)
  - [ Customisation overview ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#customisation-overview)
  - [ Exported functions ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#exported-functions)

===  Getting started

Import the package using



    #import "@preview/lovelace:0.3.0": *


The simplest usage is via ` pseudocode-list ` which transforms a nested list
into pseudocode:



    #pseudocode-list[
      + do something
      + do something else
      + _while_ still something to do
        + do even more
        + _if_ not done yet _then_
          + wait a bit
          + resume working
        + _else_
          + go home
        + _end_
      + _end_
    ]


resulting in:

![simple](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/examples/simple.svg)

As you can see, every list item becomes one line of code and nested lists
become indented blocks. There are no special commands for common keywords and
control structures, you just use whatever you like.

Maybe in your domain very uncommon structures make more sense? No problem!



    #pseudocode-list[
      + _in parallel for each_ $i = 1, ..., n$ _do_
        + fetch chunk of data $i$
        + _with probability_ $exp(-epsilon_i slash k T)$ _do_
          + perform update
        + _end_
      + _end_
    ]


![custom](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/examples/custom.svg)

===  Lower level interface

If you feel uncomfortable with abusing Typstâs lists like we do here, you
can also use the ` pseudocode ` function directly:



    #pseudocode(
      [do something],
      [do something else],
      [*while* still something to do],
      indent(
        [do even more],
        [*if* not done yet *then*],
        indent(
          [wait a bit],
          [resume working],
        ),
        [*else*],
        indent(
          [go home],
        ),
        [*end*],
      ),
      [*end*],
    )


This is equivalent to the first example. Note that each line is given as one
content argument and you indent a block by using the ` indent ` function.

This approach has the advantage that you do not rely on significant whitespace
and code formatters can automatically correctly indent your Typst code.

===  Line numbers

Lovelace puts a number in front of each line by default. If you want no
numbers at all, you can set the ` line-numbering ` option to ` none ` . The
initial example then looks like this:



    #pseudocode-list(line-numbering: none)[
      + do something
      + do something else
      + _while_ still something to do
        + do even more
        + _if_ not done yet _then_
          + wait a bit
          + resume working
        + _else_
          + go home
        + _end_
      + _end_
    ]


![no-
number](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/examples/simple-
no-numbers.svg)

(You can also pass this keyword argument to ` pseudocode ` .)

If you do want line numbers in general but need to turn them off for specific
lines, you can use ` - ` items instead of ` + ` items in ` pseudocode-list ` :



    #pseudocode-list[
      + normal line with a number
      - this line has no number
      + this one has a number again
    ]


![number-no-
number](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/examples/number-
no-number.svg)

Itâs easy to remember: ` - ` items usually produce unnumbered lists and ` +
` items produce numbered lists!

When using the ` pseudocode ` function, you can achieve the same using ` no-
number ` :



    #pseudocode(
      [normal line with a number],
      no-number[this line has no number],
      [this one has a number again],
    )


====  More line number customisation

Other than ` none ` , you can assign anything listed [ here
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/numbering/#parameters-numbering) to `
line-numbering ` .

So maybe you happen to think about the Roman Empire a lot and want to reflect
that in your pseudocode?



    #set text(font: "Cinzel")

    #pseudocode-list(line-numbering: "I:")[
      + explore European tribes
      + _while_ not all tribes conquered
        + _for each_ tribe _in_ unconquered tribes
          + try to conquer tribe
        + _end_
      + _end_
    ]


![roman](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/examples/roman.svg)

===  Referencing lines

You can reference an inividual line of a pseudocode by giving it a label.
Inside ` pseudocode-list ` , you can use ` line-label ` :



    #pseudocode-list[
      + #line-label(<start>) do something
      + #line-label(<important>) do something important
      + go back to @start
    ]

    The relevance of the step in @important cannot be overstated.


![label](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/examples/label.svg)

When using ` pseudocode ` , you can use ` with-line-label ` :



    #pseudocode(
      with-line-label(<start>)[do something],
      with-line-label(<important>)[do something important],
      [go back to @start],
    )

    The relevance of the step in @important cannot be overstated.


This has the same effect as the previous example.

The number shown in the reference uses the numbering scheme defined in the `
line-numbering ` option (see previous section).

By default, ` "Line" ` is used as the supplement for referencing lines. You
can change that using the ` line-number-supplement ` option to ` pseudocode `
or ` pseudocode-list ` .

===  Indentation guides

By default, Lovelace puts a thin gray ( ` gray + 1pt ` ) line to the left of
each indented block, which guides the reader in understanding the
indentations, just like a code editor would. You can customise this using the
` stroke ` option which takes any value that is a valid [ Typst stroke
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/stroke/) . You can especially set
it to ` none ` to have no indentation guides.

The example from the beginning becomes:



    #pseudocode-list(stroke: none)[
      + do something
      + do something else
      + _while_ still something to do
        + do even more
        + _if_ not done yet _then_
          + wait a bit
          + resume working
        + _else_
          + go home
        + _end_
      + _end_
    ]


![no-
stroke](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/examples/simple-
no-stroke.svg)

====  End blocks with hooks

Some people prefer using the indentation guide to signal the end of a block
instead of writing something like â *end* â by having a small âhookâ
at the end. To achieve that in Lovelace, you can make use of the ` hook `
option and specify how far a line should extend to the right from the
indentation guide:



    #pseudocode-list(hooks: .5em)[
      + do something
      + do something else
      + _while_ still something to do
        + do even more
        + _if_ not done yet _then_
          + wait a bit
          + resume working
        + _else_
          + go home
    ]


![hooks](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/examples/hooks.svg)

===  Spacing

You can control how far indented lines are shifted right by the ` indentation
` option. To change the space between lines, use the ` line-gap ` option.



    #pseudocode-list(indentation: 3em, line-gap: 1.5em)[
      + do something
      + do something else
      + _while_ still something to do
        + do even more
        + _if_ not done yet _then_
          + wait a bit
          + resume working
        + _else_
          + go home
        + _end_
      + _end_
    ]


![spacing](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/examples/spacing.svg)

===  Decorations

You can also add a title and/or a frame around your algorithm if you like:

====  Title

Using the ` title ` option, you can give your pseudocode a title (surprise!).
For example, to achieve [ CLRS style
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms) , you can do
something like



    #pseudocode-list(stroke: none, title: smallcaps[Fancy-Algorithm])[
      + do something
      + do something else
      + _while_ still something to do
        + do even more
        + _if_ not done yet _then_
          + wait a bit
          + resume working
        + _else_
          + go home
        + _end_
      + _end_
    ]


![title](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/examples/title.svg)

====  Booktabs

If you like wrapping your algorithm in elegant horizontal lines, you can do so
by setting the ` booktabs ` option to ` true ` .



    #pseudocode-list(booktabs: true)[
      + do something
      + do something else
      + _while_ still something to do
        + do even more
        + _if_ not done yet _then_
          + wait a bit
          + resume working
        + _else_
          + go home
        + _end_
      + _end_
    ]


![booktabs](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/examples/booktabs.svg)

Together with the ` title ` option, you can produce



    #pseudocode-list(booktabs: true, title: [My cool title])[
      + do something
      + do something else
      + _while_ still something to do
        + do even more
        + _if_ not done yet _then_
          + wait a bit
          + resume working
        + _else_
          + go home
        + _end_
      + _end_
    ]


![booktabs-
title](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/examples/booktabs-
title.svg)

By default, the outer booktab strokes are ` black + 2pt ` . You can change
that with the option ` booktabs-stroke ` to any valid [ Typst stroke
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/stroke/) . The inner line will
always have the same stroke as the outer ones, just with half the thickness.

===  Algorithm as figure

To make algorithms referencable and being able to float in the document, you
can use Typstâs ` figure ` function with a custom ` kind ` .



    #figure(
      kind: "algorithm",
      supplement: [Algorithm],
      caption: [My cool algorithm],

      pseudocode-list[
        + do something
        + do something else
        + *while* still something to do
          + do even more
          + *if* not done yet *then*
            + wait a bit
            + resume working
          + *else*
            + go home
          + *end*
        + *end*
      ]
    )


![figure](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/examples/figure.svg)

If you want to have the algorithm counter inside the title instead (see
previous section), there is the option ` numbered-title ` :



    #figure(
      kind: "algorithm",
      supplement: [Algorithm],

      pseudocode-list(booktabs: true, numbered-title: [My cool algorithm])[
        + do something
        + do something else
        + *while* still something to do
          + do even more
          + *if* not done yet *then*
            + wait a bit
            + resume working
          + *else*
            + go home
          + *end*
        + *end*

![figure-
title](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/examples/figure-
title.svg)

Note that the ` numbered-title ` option only makes sense when nesting your
pseudocode inside a figure with ` kind: "algorithm" ` , otherwise it produces
undefined results.

===  Customisation overview

Both ` pseudocode ` and ` pseudocode-list ` accept the following configuration
arguments:

*option* |  *type* |  *default*
---|---|---
[ ` line-numbering ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#line-numbers) |  ` none ` or a [ numbering ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/numbering/#parameters-numbering) |  ` "1" `
[ ` line-number-supplement ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#more-line-number-customisation) |  content  |  ` "Line" `
[ ` stroke ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#indentation-guides) |  stroke  |  ` 1pt + gray `
[ ` hooks ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#end-blocks-with-hooks) |  length  |  ` 0pt `
[ ` indentation ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#spacing) |  length  |  ` 1em `
[ ` line-gap ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#spacing) |  length  |  ` .8em `
[ ` booktabs ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#booktabs) |  bool  |  ` false `
[ ` booktabs-stroke ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#booktabs) |  stroke  |  ` 2pt + black `
[ ` title ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#title) |  content or ` none ` |  ` none `
[ ` numbered-title ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#algorithm-as-figure) |  content or ` none ` |  ` none `

Until Typst supports user defined types, we can use the following trick when
wanting to set own default values for these options. Say, you always want your
algorithms to have colons after the line numbers, no indentation guides and,
if present, blue booktabs. In this case, you would put the following at the
top of your document:



    #let my-lovelace-defaults = (
      line-numbering: "1:",
      stroke: none,
      booktabs-stroke: 2pt + blue,
    )

    #let pseudocode = pseudocode.with(..my-lovelace-defaults)
    #let pseudocode-list = pseudocode-list.with(..my-lovelace-defaults)


===  Exported functions

Lovelace exports the following functions:

  - ` pseudocode ` : Typeset pseudocode with each line as an individual content argument, see [ here ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#lower-level-interface) for details. Has [ these ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#customisation-overview) optional arguments.
  - ` pseudocode-list ` : Takes a standard Typst list and transforms it into a pseudocode. Has [ these ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#customisation-overview) optional arguments.
  - ` indent ` : Inside the argument list of ` pseudocode ` , use ` indent ` to specify an indented block, see [ here ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#lower-level-interface) for details.
  - ` no-number ` : Wrap an argument to ` pseudocode ` in this function to have the corresponding line be unnumbered, see [ here ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#line-numbers) for details.
  - ` with-line-label ` : Use this function in the ` pseudocode ` arguments to add a label to a specific line, see [ here ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#referencing-lines) for details.
  - ` line-label ` : When using ` pseudocode-list ` , you do _not_ use ` with-line-label ` but insert a call to ` line-label ` somewhere in a line to add a label, see [ here ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lovelace/0.3.0/#referencing-lines) for details.

0.2.1

Compact and legible cheat sheets

Featured  Template

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=cram-snap&version=0.2.1)

Simple cheatsheet template for [ Typst ](https://typst.app/) that allows you
to snap a quick picture of essential information and cram it into a useful
cheatsheet format.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` cram-snap ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/cram-snap


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` cram-snap ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` title ` : Title of the document
  - ` subtitle ` : Subtitle of the document
  - ` icon ` : Image that appears next to the title
  - ` column-number ` : Number of columns

The ` theader ` function is a wrapper around the ` table.header ` function
that creates a header and takes ` colspan ` as argument to span the header
across multiple table columns (by default it spans across two)

If you want to change an existing project to use this template, you can add a
show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/cram-snap:0.2.1": *

    #set page(paper: "a4", flipped: true, margin: 1cm)
    #set text(font: "Arial", size: 11pt)

    #show: cram-snap.with(
      title: [Cheatsheet],
      subtitle: [Cheatsheet for an amazing program],
      icon: image("icon.png"),
      column-number: 3,
    )

    // Use it if you want different table columns (the default are: (2fr, 3fr))
    #set table(columns: (2fr, 3fr, 3fr))

    #table(
      theader(colspan: 3)[Great heading that is really looooong],
      [Closing the program], [Type `:q`], [You can also type `QQ`]
    )

= *backtrack.md*

=  backtrack

1.0.0

A version-agnostic library for checking the compiler version.

Backtrack is a simple and performant Typst library that determines the current
compiler version and provides an API for comparing, displaying, and observing
versions.

Unlike the built-in [ version API ](https://github.com/typst/typst/pull/2016)
which is only available on Typst 0.9.0+, Backtrack works on any [ *
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/backtrack/1.0.0/#version-
support) Typst version. It uses the built-in API when available so that
itâll continue to work on all future Typst versions without modification.

Additionally, it:

  - doesnât noticeably impact compilation time. All version checks are extremely simple, and newer versions are checked first to avoid overhead from supporting old versions.
  - is automatically tested on _every_ supported Typst version to ensure reliability.
  - can be downloaded and installed manually in addition to being available as a package.

==  Example



    #import "@preview/backtrack:1.0.0": current-version, versions

    You are using Typst #current-version.displayable!
    #{
      if current-version.cmpable <= versions.v2023-03-28.cmpable [
        That is ancient.
      ] else if current-version.cmpable < versions.v0-5-0.cmpable [
        That is old.
      ] else [
        That is modern.
      ]
    }


==  Installation

There are two ways to install the library:

  - Use the package on Typst 0.6.0+. This is as simple as adding the following line to your document:

        #import "@preview/backtrack:1.0.0"


  - Download and install the library manually:
    1. Download and extract the latest [ release ](https://github.com/TheLukeGuy/backtrack/releases) .
    2. Rename ` src/lib.typ ` to ` src/backtrack.typ ` .
    3. Move/copy ` COPYING ` into ` src/ ` .
    4. Rename the ` src/ ` directory to ` backtrack/ ` .
    5. Move/copy the newly-renamed ` backtrack/ ` directory into your project.
    6. Add the following line to your document:

                #import "[path/to/]backtrack/backtrack.typ"


==  Documentation

See [ DOCS.md
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/backtrack/1.0.0/DOCS.md)
. Itâs quite short. ð

==  Version Support

Backtrack compiles on and can detect these versions:

Version  |  Status  |  Notes
---|---|---
0.6.0+  |  â  |  Also available as a package
March 28, 2023â0.5.0  |  â  |
March 21, 2023  |  â  |  Initial public/standalone Typst release
February 25, 2023  |  ð¡  |  Detects as February 15, 2023
February 12â15, 2023  |  â  |
February 2, 2023  |  ð¡  |  Detects as January 30, 2023
January 30, 2023  |  â  |

The partially-supported versions _may_ be possible to detect, but theyâre
tricky since most of their changes are content-related. Content values were
opaque up until the March 21, 2023 release, making it difficult to
automatically check for the presence of these changes.

= *iridis.md*

=  iridis

0.1.0

A package to colors matching parenthesis

Iridis is a package to colorize parenthesis in your typst document. Iridis is
a latin word that means ârainbowâ. This package is inspired by the many
rainbow parenthesis plugins available for code editors.

==  Usage

The package provides a single show-rule ` iridis-show ` that can be used to
colorize parenthesis in your document and a palette ` iridis-palette ` that
can be used to define the colors used.

The rule takes 3 arguments:

  - ` opening-parenthesis ` : The opening parenthesis character. Default is ` ("(", "[", "{") ` .
  - ` closing-parenthesis ` : The closing parenthesis character. Default is ` (")", "]", "}") ` .
  - ` palette ` : The color palette to use. Default is ` iridis-palette ` .

If the symbols are single characters, they are interpreted as normal strings
but if you use multi-character strings, then they are interpreted as regular
expressions.

==  Exemples



    #show: iridis.iridis-show

    ```rs
    fn main() {
        let n = false;
        if n {
            println!("Hello, world!");
        } else {
            println!("Goodbye, world!");
        }
    }
    ```

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>

    int main() {
        bool n = false;
        if (n) {
            std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
        } else {
            std::cout << "Goodbye, world!" << std::endl;
        }
    }
    ```

    ```py
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        n = False
        if n:

0.5.3

Aqua theme in Touying - a powerful package for creating presentation slides in
Typst.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=touying-aqua&version=0.5.3)

[ Touying ](https://github.com/touying-typ/touying) (æå½± in chinese,
/tÃ³uyÇng/, meaning projection) is a user-friendly, powerful and efficient
package for creating presentation slides in Typst. Partial code is inherited
from [ Polylux ](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/polylux) . Therefore,
some concepts and APIs remain consistent with Polylux.

Touying provides automatically injected global configurations, which is
convenient for configuring themes. Besides, Touying does not rely on ` counter
` and ` context ` to implement ` #pause ` , resulting in better performance.

If you like it, consider [ giving a star on GitHub
](https://github.com/touying-typ/touying) . Touying is a community-driven
project, feel free to suggest any ideas and contribute.

==  Quick start

Before you begin, make sure you have installed the Typst environment. If not,
you can use the [ Web App ](https://typst.app/) or the [ Tinymist LSP
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist)
extensions for VS Code.

To use Touying, you only need to include the following code in your document:



    #import "@preview/touying:0.5.3": *
    #import themes.simple: *

    #show: simple-theme.with(aspect-ratio: "16-9")

    = Title

    == First Slide

    Hello, Touying!

    #pause

    Hello, Typst!


![image](https://github.com/touying-
typ/touying/assets/34951714/f5bdbf8f-7bf9-45fd-9923-0fa5d66450b2)

Itâs simple. Congratulations on creating your first Touying slide! ð

*Tip:* You can use Typst syntax like ` #import "config.typ": * ` or `
#include "content.typ" ` to implement Touyingâs multi-file architecture.

==  More Complex Examples

In fact, Touying provides various styles for writing slides. For example, the
above example uses first-level and second-level titles to create new slides.
However, you can also use the ` #slide[..] ` format to access more powerful
features provided by Touying.

    = Animation

    == Simple Animation

    We can use `#pause` to #pause display something later.

    #pause

    Just like this.

    #meanwhile

    Meanwhile, #pause we can also use `#meanwhile` to #pause display other content synchronously.

    #speaker-note[
      + This is a speaker note.
      + You won't see it unless you use `config-common(show-notes-on-second-screen: right)`
    ]


    == Complex Animation

    At subslide #touying-fn-wrapper((self: none) => str(self.subslide)), we can

    use #uncover("2-")[`#uncover` function] for reserving space,

    use #only("2-")[`#only` function] for not reserving space,

    #alternatives[call `#only` multiple times \u{2717}][use `#alternatives` function #sym.checkmark] for choosing one of the alternatives.


    == Callback Style Animation

    #slide(repeat: 3, self => [
      #let (uncover, only, alternatives) = utils.methods(self)

      At subslide #self.subslide, we can

      use #uncover("2-")[`#uncover` function] for reserving space,

      use #only("2-")[`#only` function] for not reserving space,

      #alternatives[call `#only` multiple times \u{2717}][use `#alternatives` function #sym.checkmark] for choosing one of the alternatives.
    ])


    == Math Equation Animation

    Equation with `pause`:

    $
      f(x) &= pause x^2 + 2x + 1  \
           &= pause (x + 1)^2  \
    $

    #meanwhile

    Here, #pause we have the expression of $f(x)$.

    #pause

    By factorizing, we can obtain this result.


    == CeTZ Animation

    CeTZ Animation in Touying:

    #cetz-canvas({
      import cetz.draw: *

      rect((0,0), (5,5))

      (pause,)

      rect((0,0), (1,1))
      rect((1,1), (2,2))
      rect((2,2), (3,3))

      (pause,)

      line((0,0), (2.5, 2.5), name: "line")
    })


    == Fletcher Animation

    Fletcher Animation in Touying:

    #fletcher-diagram(
      node-stroke: .1em,
      node-fill: gradient.radial(blue.lighten(80%), blue, center: (30%, 20%), radius: 80%),
      spacing: 4em,
      edge((-1,0), "r", "-|>", `open(path)`, label-pos: 0, label-side: center),
      node((0,0), `reading`, radius: 2em),
      edge((0,0), (0,0), `read()`, "--|>", bend: 130deg),
      pause,
      edge(`read()`, "-|>"),
      node((1,0), `eof`, radius: 2em),
      pause,
      edge(`close()`, "-|>"),
      node((2,0), `closed`, radius: 2em, extrude: (-2.5, 0)),
      edge((0,0), (2,0), `close()`, "-|>", bend: -40deg),
    )


    = Theorems

    == Prime numbers

    #definition[
      A natural number is called a #highlight[_prime number_] if it is greater
      than 1 and cannot be written as the product of two smaller natural numbers.
    ]
    #example[
      The numbers $2$, $3$, and $17$ are prime.
      @cor_largest_prime shows that this list is not exhaustive!
    ]

    #theorem("Euclid")[
      There are infinitely many primes.
    ]
    #proof[
      Suppose to the contrary that $p_1, p_2, dots, p_n$ is a finite enumeration
      of all primes. Set $P = p_1 p_2 dots p_n$. Since $P + 1$ is not in our list,
      it cannot be prime. Thus, some prime factor $p_j$ divides $P + 1$.  Since
      $p_j$ also divides $P$, it must divide the difference $(P + 1) - P = 1$, a
      contradiction.
    ]

    #corollary[
      There is no largest prime number.
    ] <cor_largest_prime>
    #corollary[
      There are infinitely many composite numbers.

0.5.0

Display chessboards.

Display chessboards in Typst.

==  Displaying chessboards

The main function of this package is ` board ` . It lets you display a
specific position on a board.



    #board(starting-position)


![image](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/board-n-
pieces/0.5.0/examples/example-1.svg)

` starting-position ` is a position that is provided by the package. It
represents the initial position of a chess game.

You can create a different position using the ` position ` function. It
accepts strings representing each rank. Use upper-case letters for white
pieces, and lower-case letters for black pieces. Dots and spaces correspond to
empty squares.



    #board(position(
      "....r...",
      "........",
      "..p..PPk",
      ".p.r....",
      "pP..p.R.",
      "P.B.....",
      "..P..K..",
      "........",
    ))


![image](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/board-n-
pieces/0.5.0/examples/example-2.svg)

Alternatively, you can use the ` fen ` function to create a position using [
ForsythâEdwards notation
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) :



    #board(fen("r1bk3r/p2pBpNp/n4n2/1p1NP2P/6P1/3P4/P1P1K3/q5b1 b - - 1 23"))


![image](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/board-n-
pieces/0.5.0/examples/example-3.svg)

Note that you can specify only the first part of the FEN string:



    #board(fen("r4rk1/pp2Bpbp/1qp3p1/8/2BP2b1/Q1n2N2/P4PPP/3RK2R"))


![image](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/board-n-
pieces/0.5.0/examples/example-4.svg)

Also note that positions do not need to be on a standard 8Ã8 board:



    #board(position(
      "....Q....",
      "......Q..",
      "........Q",
      "...Q.....",
      ".Q.......",
      ".......Q.",
      ".....Q...",
      "..Q......",
      "Q........",
    ))


![image](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/board-n-
pieces/0.5.0/examples/example-5.svg)

==  Using the ` game ` function

The ` game ` function creates an array of positions from a full chess game. A
game is described by a series of turns written in [ standard algebraic
notation ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_\(chess\)) . Those
turns can be specified as an array of strings, or as a single string
containing whitespace-separated moves.



    The scholar's mate:
    #let positions = game("e4 e5 Qh5 Nc6 Bc4 Nf6 Qxf7")
    #grid(
      columns: 4,
      gutter: 0.2cm,
      ..positions.map(board.with(square-size: 0.5cm)),
    )


![image](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/board-n-
pieces/0.5.0/examples/example-6.svg)

You can specify an alternative starting position to the ` game ` function with
the ` starting-position ` named argument.

==  Using the ` pgn ` function to import PGN files

Similarly to the ` game ` function, the ` pgn ` function creates an array of
positions. It accepts a single argument, which is a string containing [
portable game notation ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation)
. To read a game from a PGN file, you can use this function in combination
with Typstâs native [ ` read ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/data-
loading/read/) function.



    #let positions = pgn(read("game.pgn"))


Note that the argument to ` pgn ` must describe a single game. If you have a
PGN file containing multiple games, you will need to split them using other
means.

==  Using non-standard chess pieces

The ` board ` functionâs ` pieces ` argument lets you specify how to display
each piece by mapping each piece character to some content. You can use this
feature to display non-standard chess pieces:



    #board(
      fen("g7/5g2/8/8/8/8/p6g/k1K4G"),
      pieces: (
        // We use symbols for the example.
        // In practice, you should import your own images.
        g: chess-sym.queen.black.b,
        p: chess-sym.pawn.black,
        k: chess-sym.king.black,
        K: chess-sym.king.white,
        G: chess-sym.queen.white.b,
      ),
    )


![image](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/board-n-
pieces/0.5.0/examples/example-7.svg)

==  Customizing a chessboard

The ` board ` function lets you customize the appearance of the board in
various ways, as illustrated in the example below.



    // From https://lichess.org/study/Xf1PGrM0.
    #board(
      fen("3k4/7R/8/2PK4/8/8/8/6r1 b - - 0 1"),

      marked-squares: "c7 c6 h6",
      arrows: ("d8 c8", "d8 c7", "g1 g6", "h7 h6"),
      display-numbers: true,

      white-square-fill: rgb("#d2eeea"),
      black-square-fill: rgb("#567f96"),
      marking-color: rgb("#2bcbC6"),
      arrow-stroke: 0.2cm + rgb("#38f442df"),

      stroke: 0.8pt + black,
    )


![image](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/board-n-
pieces/0.5.0/examples/example-8.svg)

Here is a list of all the available arguments:

  - ` marked-squares ` is a list of squares to mark (e.g., ` ("d3", "d2", "e3") ` ). It can also be specified as a single string containing whitespace-separated squares (e.g., ` "d3 d2 e3" ` ).

  - ` arrows ` is a list of arrows to draw (e.g., ` ("e2 e4", "e7 e5") ` ).

  - ` reverse ` is a boolean indicating whether to reverse the board, displaying it from blackâs point of view. This is ` false ` by default, meaning the board is displayed from whiteâs point of view.

  - ` display-numbers ` is a boolean indicating whether ranks and files should be numbered. This is ` false ` by default.

  - ` rank-numbering ` and ` file-numbering ` are functions describing how ranks and files should be numbered. By default they are respectively ` numbering.with("1") ` and ` numbering.with("a") ` .

  - ` square-size ` is a length describing the size of each square. By default, this is ` 1cm ` .

  - ` white-square-fill ` and ` black-square-fill ` indicate how squares should be filled. They can be colors, gradient or patterns.

  - ` marking-color ` is the color to use for markings (marked squares and arrows).

  - ` marked-white-square-background ` and ` marked-black-square-background ` define the content to display in the background of marked squares. By default, this is a circle using the ` marking-color ` .

  - ` arrow-stroke ` is the stroke to draw the arrows with. If only a length is given, ` marking-color ` is used. Alternatively, a stroke can be passed to specify a different color.

  - ` pieces ` is a dictionary containing images representing each piece. If specified, the dictionary must contain an entry for every piece kind in the displayed position. Keys are single upper-case letters for white pieces and single lower-case letters for black pieces. The default images are taken from [ Wikimedia Commons ](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_chess_pieces) . Please refer to [ the section on licensing ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/board-n-pieces/0.5.0/#licensing) for information on how you can use them in your documents.

  - ` stroke ` has the same structure as [ ` rect ` âs ` stroke ` parameter ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/rect/#parameters-stroke) and corresponds to the stroke to use around the board. If ` display-numbers ` is ` true ` , the numbers are displayed outside the stroke. The default value is ` none ` .

==  Chess symbols

This package also exports chess symbols for all Unicode chess-related
codepoints under the ` chess-sym ` submodule. Standard chess pieces are
available as ` chess-
sym.{pawn,knight,bishop,rook,queen,king}.{white,black,neutral} ` .
Alternatively, you can use ` stroked ` and ` filled ` instead of,
respectively, ` white ` and ` black ` . They can be rotated rightward,
downward, and leftward respectively with with ` .r ` , ` .b ` , and ` .l ` .
Chinese chess pieces are also available as ` chess-
sym.{soldier,cannon,chariot,horse,elephant,mandarin,general}.{red,black} ` .
Similarly, you can use ` stroked ` and ` filled ` as alternatives to,
respectively, ` red ` and ` black ` . Note that most fonts only support black
and white versions of standard pieces. To use the other symbols, you may have
to use a font such as Noto Sans Symbols 2.



    The best move in this position is #chess-sym.knight.white;c6.

=  superb-pci

0.1.0

A Peer Community In (PCI) and Peer Community Journal (PCJ) template.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=superb-pci&version=0.1.0)

Template for [ Peer Community In ](https://peercommunityin.org/) (PCI)
submission and [ Peer Community Journal ](https://peercommunityjournal.org/)
(PCJ) post-recommendation upload.

The template is as close as possible to the LaTeX one.

==  Usage

To use this template in Typst, simply import it at the top of your document.



    #import "@preview/superb-pci:0.1.0": *


Alternatively, you can start using this template from the command line with



    typst init @preview/superb-pci:0.1.0 my-superb-manuscript-dir


or directly in the web app by clicking âStart from templateâ.

Please see the main Readme about Typst packages [
https://github.com/typst/packages ](https://github.com/typst/packages) .

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` pci ` function with the following named arguments:

  - ` title ` : the paper title
  - ` authors ` : array of author dictionaries. Each author must have the ` name ` field, and can have the optional fields ` orcid ` , and ` affiliations ` .
  - ` affiliations ` : array of affiliation dictionaries, each with the keys ` id ` and ` name ` . All correspondence between authors and affiliations is done manually.
  - ` abstract ` : abstract of the paper as content
  - ` doi ` : DOI of the paper displayed on the front page
  - ` keywords ` : array of keywords displayed on the front page
  - ` correspondence ` : corresponding address displayed on the front page
  - ` numbered_sections ` : boolean, whether sections should be numbered
  - ` pcj ` : boolean, provides a way to remove the front page and headers/footers for upload to the Peer Community Journal. ` [default: false] `

The template will initialize your folder with a sample call to the ` pci `
function in a show rule and dummy content as an example. If you want to change
an existing project to use this template, you can add a show rule like this at
the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/superb-pci:0.1.0": *

    #show: pci.with(
      title: [Sample for the template, with quite a very long title],
      abstract: lorem(200),

      ),
      doi: "https://doi.org/10.5802/fake.doi",
      keywords: ("Scientific writing", "Typst", "PCI", "Example"),
      correspondence: "a-lavois@lead-free-univ.edu",
      numbered_sections: false,
      pcj: false,
    )

This is a document template for creating professional-looking documents with
Typst, tailored for FHICT (Fontys Hogeschool ICT).

==  Introduction

Creating well-structured and visually appealing documents is crucial in
academic and professional settings. This template is designed to help FHICT
students and faculty produce professional looking documents.

![Showcase](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/unofficial-
fhict-document-template/1.1.1/thumbnail.png)
![Showcase](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/unofficial-
fhict-document-template/1.1.1/showcase-r.png)

==  Features

  - Consistent formatting for titles, headings, subheadings, paragraphs and other elements.
  - Clean and professional document layout.
  - FHICT Style.
  - Configurable document options.
  - Helper functions.
  - Multiple languages support (nl, en, de, fr, es).

==  Requirements

==  Getting Started

To get started with this Typst document template, follow these steps:

  1. *Check for the roboto font* : Check if you have the roboto font installed on your system. If you donât, you can download it from [ Google Fonts ](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) .
  2. *Install Typst* : I recommend to use VSCode with [ Tinymist Typst Extension ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) . You will also need a PDF viewer in VSCode if you want to view the document live.
  3. *Import the template* : Import the template into your own typst document. ` #import "@preview/unofficial-fhict-document-template:1.1.1": * `
  4. *Set the available options* : Set the available options in the template file to your liking.
  5. *Start writing* : Start writing your document.

==  Helpful Links / Resources

  - The manual contains a list of all available options and helper functions. It can be found [ here ](https://github.com/TomVer99/FHICT-typst-template/blob/main/documentation/manual.pdf) or attached to the latest release.
  - The [ Typst Documentation ](https://typst.app/docs/) is a great resource for learning how to use Typst.
  - The bibliography file is written in [ BibTeX ](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) . You can use [ BibTeX Editor ](https://truben.no/latex/bibtex/) to easily create and edit your bibliography.
  - You can use sub files to split your document into multiple files. This is especially useful for large documents.

==  Contributing

I welcome contributions to improve and expand this document template. If you
have ideas, suggestions, or encounter issues, please consider contributing by
creating a pull request or issue.

===  Adding a new language

Currently, the template supports the following languages: ` Dutch ` ` (nl) ` ,
` English ` ` (en) ` , ` German ` ` (de) ` , ` French ` ` (fr) ` , and `
Spanish ` ` (es) ` . If you want to add a new language, you can do so by
following these steps:

=  grotesk-cv

1.0.1

A clean CV and cover letter template based on Brilliant-cv and fireside
templates.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=grotesk-cv&version=1.0.1)

Version 1.0.1

grotesk-cv provides a pair of elegant and simple, one-page CV and cover letter
templates, inspired by the [ Brilliant-cv
](https://typst.app/universe/package/brilliant-cv/) and [ fireside
](https://typst.app/universe/package/fireside/1.0.0/) templates.

===  Features

  - Templates for multilingual CV and cover letter, enabled by flag
  - Separation of styling and content
  - Customizable fonts, colors and icons

==  Preview

CV  |  Cover Letter
---|---
![CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AsiSkarp/grotesk-cv/main/examples/cv_example.png?raw=true) |  ![Cover Letter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AsiSkarp/grotesk-cv/main/examples/cover_letter_example.png?raw=true)

==  Getting Started

To edit this template, changes are mostly made in either of two places.
Changes to contact information or layout settings are made in ` info.toml ` .
To change the section contents, navigate to the corresponding section file
e.g. ` content/profile.typ ` to edit the *Profile* section.

===  Adding or Removing Sections

To add a new section, create a new ` .typ ` file in the ` content ` directory
with the desired section name. To include the section in the CV, add the
section at the desired position in either left or right panes in the ` cv.typ
` file. To remove sections, simply remove or comment-out the section name in
the same list of section names in the ` cv.typ ` file. Sections are rendered
in the order they appear in the list. The section column width can be adjusted
in the ` info.toml ` file under the ` left_pane_width ` value. In the
following example, the ` projects.typ ` section file has been created and is
included in the left pane of the CV, and the ` education.typ ` section has
been removed.



    #let left-pane = (
      "profile",
      "experience",
      //"education",
      "projects",
    )


===  Changing Profile Photo

To change the profile photo, upload your image to the ` content/img ` folder.
To enable the new image, update the ` profile_image ` value in ` info.toml `
with the name of your uploaded image.

===  Changing FontAwesome Icons

The template uses [ FontAwesome ](https://fontawesome.com/) for all icons. To
change an icon, change the desired icon string in the ` info.toml ` file with
the corresponding FontAwesome icon name. Icon strings can be found in the [
cheat sheet ](https://fontawesome.com/v4/cheatsheet/) . Note that the icon
strings must be written without the ` fa- ` prefix. To disable the use of
icons, set the ` include_icons ` value to ` false ` .

===  Customizing Contact Information

To change or add contact information, update the corresponding value under `
[personal.info] ` in the ` info.toml ` file. Information is rendered in the
order it appears in the file. To add a new contact information field, add a
new variable under ` [personal.info] ` with the desired string value. Next,
assign a valid FontAwesome icon string to a variable of the same name under `
[personal.icon] ` . In the following example, a homepage field has been added
to the contact information.



    [personal.info]
    homepage = "www.myawesomehomepage.com"

    [personal.icon]
    homepage = "globe"


===  Changing language

The template provides the option to instantly change the language of the CV
and cover letter by using a variable in the ` info.toml ` file. The template
demonstrates the use of the ` language ` variable to switch between English
and Spanish, but any language can be used, provided that the information is
entered manually inside the corresponding section files. For instance, to
change the alternate language to German, changes would have to be made in the
section files to include the German text. In the following example, the
language of the *Profile* section has been changed from Spanish to German,
and the required changes have been made in the ` content/profile.typ ` file.



    // = Summary
    = #if include-icon [#fa-icon(icon) #h(5pt)] #if language == "en" [Summary] else if language == "ger" [Zusammenfassung]

    ]



===  Changing Fonts

If using the template online with Typst Universe, multiple font types are
available to use, a list of which can be found by pressing the ` Ag ` button.
To use a different font, upload a ` ttf ` or ` otf ` file to the `
content/fonts ` folder and update the ` font ` value in the ` info.toml ` file
with the name of the uploaded font.

===  Installation

To use the template offline, clone this repository to your local machine.
Typst can be used and rendered offline by installing the Typst CLI. My
preferred workflow has been to use VSCode with the [ Tinymist
](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/releases) extension, which
provides LSP support, syntax highlighting, and error checking, live rendered
previews and automatic exports to PDF.

Please feel free to fork this repository and create PRs for any changes or
improvements.

template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/silky-letter-
insa-0.2.2-small.webp)

=  silky-letter-insa

0.2.2

A template made for letters and short documents of INSA, a French engineering
school.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=silky-letter-insa&version=0.2.2)

Typst Template for short documents and letters for the french engineering
school INSA.

==  Example

By default, the template initializes with the ` insa-letter ` show rule, with
parameters that you must fill in by yourself.

Here is an example of filled template:



    #import "@preview/silky-letter-insa:0.2.2": *
    #show: doc => insa-letter(
      author: "Youenn LE JEUNE, Kelian NINET",
      insa: "rennes"
      doc)

    #v(15pt)
    #align(center, text(size: 22pt, weight: "bold", smallcaps("ProbabilitÃ©s - Annale 2022 (V1)")))
    #v(5pt)

    #set heading(numbering: "1.")
    #show heading.where(level: 2): it => [
      #counter(heading).display()
      #text(weight: "medium", style: "italic", size: 13pt, it.body)

    ]

    = Intervalle de confiance
    == Calculer sur lâÃ©chantillon une estimation de la moyenne.
    $ overline(x_n) = 1/n sum_(i=1)^n x_i = 1885 $

    == Calculer sur lâÃ©chantillon une estimation de la variance.
    $
    "Variance biaisÃ©e :" s^2 &= 1/n sum_(i=1)^n (x_i - overline(x_n))^2 = 218^2\
    "Variance corrigÃ©e :" s'^2 &=  n/(n-1) s^2 = 231^2
    $

    Le bon estimateur est le second.

    == Ãcrire le code R permettant dâÃ©valuer les deux bornes de lâintervalle de confiance du temps dâexÃ©cution avec une confiance de 92%.
    Nous sommes dans le cas d'une recherche de moyenne avec variance inconnue, l'intervalle sera donc
    $ [overline(X) + t_(n-1)(alpha/2) S'/sqrt(n), quad overline(X) + t_(n-1)(1 - alpha/2) S'/sqrt(n)] $
    En R, avec l'Ã©chantillon nommÃ© `data`, Ã§a donne
    ```R
    data = c(1653, 2059, 2281, 1813, 2180, 1721, 1857, 1677, 1728)
    moyenne = mean(data)
    s_prime = sqrt(var(data)) # car la variance de R est dÃ©jÃ  corrigÃ©e
    n = 9
    alpha = 0.08

    IC_min = moyenne + qt(alpha / 2, df = n - 1) * s_prime / sqrt(n)
    IC_max = moyenne + qt(1 - alpha / 2, df = n - 1) * s_prime / sqrt(n)
    ```

    Ici on a $[1730, 2040]$.


==  Fonts

The graphic charter recommends the fonts *League Spartan* for headings and
*Source Serif* for regular text. To have the best look, you should install
those fonts.

To behave correctly on computers without those specific fonts installed, this
template will automatically fallback to other similar fonts:

  - *League Spartan* -> *Arial* (approved by INSAâs graphic charter, by default in Windows) -> *Liberation Sans* (by default in most Linux)
  - *Source Serif* -> *Source Serif 4* (downloadable for free) -> *Georgia* (approved by the graphic charter) -> *Linux Libertine* (default Typst font)

===  Note on variable fonts

If you want to install those fonts on your computer, Typst might not recognize
them if you install their _Variable_ versions. You should install the static
versions ( *League Spartan Bold* and most versions of *Source Serif* ).

Keep an eye on [ the issue in Typst bug tracker
](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/185) to see when variable fonts will
be used!

==  Notes

This template is being developed by Youenn LE JEUNE from the INSA de Rennes in
[ this repository ](https://github.com/SkytAsul/INSA-Typst-Template) .

For now it includes assets from the graphic charters of those INSAs:

  - Rennes ( ` rennes ` )
  - Hauts de France ( ` hdf ` )
  - Centre Val de Loire ( ` cvl ` ) Users from other INSAs can open a pull request on the repository with the assets for their INSA.

If you have any other feature request, open an issue on the repository as
well.

==  License

The typst template is licensed under the [ MIT license
](https://github.com/SkytAsul/INSA-Typst-Template/blob/main/LICENSE) . This
does _not_ apply to the image assets. Those image files are property of Groupe
INSA.

==  Changelog

===  0.2.2

  - Added INSA CVL assets

===  0.2.1

  - Added ` insa ` option
  - Added INSA HdF assets

This package enables you to write CommonMark Markdown, and import it directly
into Typst.

` simple.typ ` |  ` simple.md `
---|---


    #import "@preview/cmarker:0.1.1"

    #cmarker.render(read("simple.md"))


|



    # We can write Markdown!

    *Using* __lots__ ~of~ `fancy` [features](https://example.org/).


` simple.pdf `
---
![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/cmarker/0.1.1/examples/simple.png)

This document is available in [ Markdown
](https://github.com/SabrinaJewson/cmarker.typ/tree/main#cmarker) and [
rendered PDF
](https://github.com/SabrinaJewson/cmarker.typ/blob/main/README.pdf) formats.

==  API

We offer a single function:



    render(
      markdown,
      smart-punctuation: true,
      blockquote: none,
      math: none,
      h1-level: 1,
      raw-typst: true,
      scope: (:),
      show-source: false,
    ) -> content


The parameters are as follows:

  - ` markdown ` : The [ CommonMark ](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/) Markdown string to be processed. Parsed with the [ pulldown-cmark ](https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark) Rust library. You can set this to ` read("somefile.md") ` to import an external markdown file; see the [ documentation for the read function ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/data-loading/read/) .

    - Accepted values: Strings and raw text code blocks.
    - Required.
  - ` smart-punctuation ` : Automatically convert ASCII punctuation to Unicode equivalents:

    - nondirectional quotations (" and ') become directional (ââ and ââ);
    - three consecutive full stops (â¦) become ellipses (â¦);
    - two and three consecutive hypen-minus signs (-- and â) become en and em dashes (â and â).

Note that although Typst also offers this functionality, this conversion is
done through the Markdown parser rather than Typst.

    - Accepted values: Booleans.
    - Default value: ` true ` .
  - ` blockquote ` : A callback to be used when a blockquote is encountered in the Markdown, or ` none ` if blockquotes should be treated as normal text. Because Typst does not support blockquotes natively, the user must configure this.

    - Accepted values: Functions accepting content and returning content, or ` none ` .
    - Default value: ` none ` .

For example, to display a black border to the left of the text one can use:


        box.with(stroke: (left: 1pt + black), inset: (left: 5pt, y: 6pt))


  - ` math ` : A callback to be used when equations are encountered in the Markdown, or ` none ` if it should be treated as normal text. Because Typst does not support LaTeX equations natively, the user must configure this.

    - Accepted values: Functions that take a boolean argument named ` block ` and a positional string argument (often, the ` mitex ` function from [ the mitex package ](https://typst.app/universe/package/mitex) ), or ` none ` .
    - Default value: ` none ` .

For example, to render math equation as a Typst math block, one can use:


        #import "@preview/mitex:0.2.4": mitex
    #cmarker.render(`$\int_1^2 x \mathrm{d} x$`, math: mitex)


  - ` h1-level ` : The level that top-level headings in Markdown should get in Typst. When set to zero, top-level headings are treated as text, ` ## ` headings become ` = ` headings, ` ### ` headings become ` == ` headings, et cetera; when set to ` 2 ` , ` # ` headings become ` == ` headings, ` ## ` headings become ` === ` headings, et cetera.

    - Accepted values: Integers in the range [0, 255].
    - Default value: 1.
  - ` raw-typst ` : Whether to allow raw Typst code to be injected into the document via HTML comments. If disabled, the comments will act as regular HTML comments.

    - Accepted values: Booleans.
    - Default value: ` true ` .

For example, when this is enabled, ` <!--raw-typst #circle(radius: 10pt) --> `
will result in a circle in the document (but only when rendered through
Typst). See also ` <!--typst-begin-exclude--> ` and ` <!--typst-end-exclude-->
` , which is the inverse of this.

  - ` scope ` : When ` raw-typst ` is enabled, this is a dictionary providing the context in which the evaluated Typst code runs. It is useful to pass values in to code inside ` <!--raw-typst--> ` blocks.

    - Accepted values: Any dictionary.
    - Default value: ` (:) ` .
  - ` show-source ` : A debugging tool. When set to ` true ` , the Typst code that would otherwise have been displayed will be instead rendered in a code block.

    - Accepted values: Booleans.
    - Default value: ` false ` .

This function returns the rendered ` content ` .

==  Supported Markdown Syntax

We support CommonMark with a couple extensions.

  - Paragraph breaks: Two newlines, i.e. one blank line.
  - Hard line breaks (used more in poetry than prose): Put two spaces at the end of the line.
  - ` *emphasis* ` or ` _emphasis_ ` : _emphasis_
  - ` *strong* ` or ` __strong__ ` : *strong*
  - ` ~strikethrough~ ` : ~strikethrough~
  - ` [links](https://example.org) ` : [ links ](https://example.org/)
  - ` ### Headings ` , where ` # ` is a top-level heading, ` ## ` a subheading, ` ### ` a sub-subheading, etc
  - ` `inline code blocks` ` : ` inline code blocks `
  *     ```
    out of line code blocks
    ```


Syntax highlighting can be achieved by specifying a language after the opening
backticks:


        ```rust
    let x = 5;
    ```


giving:


        let x = 5;


  - ` --- ` , making a horizontal rule:

- * *

  *     - Unordered
    - lists


    - Unordered
    - Lists
  *     1. Ordered
    1. Lists


    1. Ordered
    2. Lists
  - ` $x + y$ ` or ` $$x + y$$ ` : math equations, if the ` math ` parameter is set.
  - ` > blockquotes ` , if the ` blockquote ` parameter is set.
  - Images: ` ![Some tiled hexagons](examples/hexagons.png) ` , giving ![Some tiled hexagons](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/cmarker/0.1.1/examples/hexagons.png)

==  Interleaving Markdown and Typst

Sometimes, you might want to render a certain section of the document only
when viewed as Markdown, or only when viewed through Typst. To achieve the
former, you can simply wrap the section in ` <!--typst-begin-exclude--> ` and
` <!--typst-end-exclude--> ` :



    Hello from not Typst!



Most Markdown parsers support HTML comments, so from their perspective this is
no different to just writing out the Markdown directly; but ` cmarker.typ `
knows to search for those comments and avoid rendering the content in between.

Note that when the opening comment is followed by the end of an element, `
cmarker.typ ` will close the block for you. For example:



    >
    > One

    Two


In this code, âTwoâ will be given no matter where the document is
rendered. This is done to prevent us from generating invalid Typst code.

Conversely, one can put Typst code inside a HTML comment of the form ` <!--
raw-typst [â¦]--> ` to have it evaluated directly as Typst code (but only if
the ` raw-typst ` option to ` render ` is set to ` true ` , otherwise it will
just be seen as a regular comment and removed):





==  MarkdownâTypst Polyglots

This project has a manual as a PDF and a README as a Markdown document, but by
the power of this library they are in fact the same thing! Furthermore, one
can read the ` README.md ` in a markdown viewer and it will display correctly,
but one can _also_ run ` typst compile README.md ` to generate the Typst-
typeset ` README.pdf ` .

How does this work? We just have to be clever about how we write the README:



    (Typst preamble content)
    #"


    Regular Markdown goes hereâ¦




The same code but syntax-highlighted as Typst code helps to illuminate it:



    <picture>
    (Typst preamble content)
    #"</picture>
    <!--".slice(0,0)
    #import "@preview/cmarker:0.1.1"
    #let markdown = read("README.md")
    #markdown = markdown.slice(markdown.position("</picture>") + "</picture>".len())
    #cmarker.render(markdown, h1-level: 0)
    /*-->

    Regular Markdown goes hereâ¦

    <!--*///-->


==  Limitations

  - We do not currently support HTML tags, and they will be stripped from the output; for example, GitHub supports writing ` <sub>text</sub> ` to get subscript text, but we will render that as simply âtextâ. In future it would be nice to support a subset of HTML tags.
  - We do not currently support Markdown tables and footnotes. In future it would be good to.
  - Although I tried my best to escape everything correctly, I wonât provide a hard guarantee that everything is fully sandboxed even if you set ` raw-typst: false ` . That said, Typst itself is well-sandboxed anyway.

==  Development

  - Build the plugin with ` ./build.sh ` , which produces the ` plugin.wasm ` necessary to use this.
  - Compile examples with ` typst compile examples/{name}.typ --root . ` .
  - Compile this README to PDF with ` typst compile README.md ` .

= *equate.md*

=  equate

0.2.1

Breakable equations with improved numbering.

Featured  Package

A package for improved layout of equations and mathematical expressions.

When applied, this package will split up multi-line block equations into
multiple elements, so that each line can be assigned a separate number. By
default, the equation counter is incremented for each line, but this behavior
can be changed by setting the ` sub-numbering ` argument to ` true ` . In this
case, the equation counter will only be incremented once for the entire block,
and each line will be assigned a sub-number like ` 1a ` , ` 2.1 ` , or
similar, depending on the set equation numbering. You can also set the `
number-mode ` argument to ` "label" ` to only number labelled lines. If a
label is only applied to the full equation, all lines will be numbered.

This splitting also makes it possible to spread equations over page boundaries
while keeping alignment in place, which can be useful for long derivations or
proofs. This can be configured by the ` breakable ` parameter of the ` equate
` function, or by setting the ` breakable ` parameter of ` block ` for
equations via a show-set rule. Additionally, the alignment of the equation
number is improved, so that it always matches the baseline of the equation.

If you want to create a âstandardâ equation with a single equation number
centered across all lines, you can attach the ` <equate:revoke> ` label to the
equation. This will disable the effect of this package for the current
equation. This label can also be used in single lines of an equation to
disable numbering for that line only.

==  Usage

The package comes with a single ` equate ` function that is supposed to be
used as a template. It takes two optional arguments for customization:

Argument  |  Type  |  Description  |  Default
---|---|---|---
` breakable ` |  ` boolean ` , ` auto ` |  Whether to allow the equation to break across pages.  |  ` auto `
` sub-numbering ` |  ` boolean ` |  Whether to assign sub-numbers to each line of an equation.  |  ` false `
` number-mode ` |  ` "line" ` , ` "label" ` |  Whether to number all lines or only those with a label.  |  ` "line" `

To reference a specific line of an equation, include the label at the end of
the line, like in the following example:



    #import "@preview/equate:0.2.1": equate

    #show: equate.with(breakable: true, sub-numbering: true)
    #set math.equation(numbering: "(1.1)")

    The dot product of two vectors $arrow(a)$ and $arrow(b)$ can
    be calculated as shown in @dot-product.

    $
      angle.l a, b angle.r &= arrow(a) dot arrow(b) \
                           &= a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + ... a_n b_n \
                           &= sum_(i=1)^n a_i b_i. #<sum>
    $ <dot-product>

    The sum notation in @sum is a useful way to express the dot
    product of two vectors.

===  Local Usage

If you only want to use the package features on selected equations, you can
also apply the ` equate ` function directly to the equation. This will
override the default behavior for the current equation only. Note, that this
will require you to use the ` equate ` function as a show rule for references,
as shown in the following example:



    #import "@preview/equate:0.2.1": equate

    // Allow references to a line of the equation.
    #show ref: equate

    #set math.equation(numbering: "(1.1)", supplement: "Eq.")

    #equate($
      E &= m c^2 #<short> \
        &= sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4) #<long>
    $)

    While @short is the famous equation by Einstein, @long is a
    more general form of the energy-momentum relation.


![Result of example
code.](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/equate/0.2.1/assets/example-
local.svg)

As an alternative to the show rule, it is also possible to manually wrap each
reference in an ` equate ` function, though this is less convenient and more
prone to mistakes.

= *titleize.md*

=  titleize

0.1.1

Turn strings into title case

Small wrapper around the [ titlecase ](https://crates.io/crates/titlecase)
library to convert text to title case. It follows the [ rules defined by John
Gruber ](https://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case) . For more details,
refer to the library.

` titlecase ` applies a show rule, that by default transforms every string of
at least four characters. This limit can be changed with the ` limit `
parameter. Especially with equations, the results can be a bit unpredictable,
so proceed with care.



    #import "@preview/titleize:0.1.1": titlecase

    #for s in (
      "Being productive on linux",
      "Finding an alternative to Mac OS X â part 2",
      [an example with small words and sub-phrases: "the example"],
    ) [
      #s => #titlecase(s) \
    ]

    #let debug-print(x) = {
      if type(x) == content {
        let fields = x.fields()
        let func = x.func()
        [
          #repr(func)
          #for (k, v) in fields [
            - #k: #debug-print(v)
          ]
        ]
      } else {
        if type(x) == array [
          array
          #for y in x [
            - #debug-print(y)
          ]
        ] else [
          #repr(type(x)) (#repr(x))
        ]
      }
    }

    #show: titlecase

    = This is a test, even with math $a = b + c$

    In math, text can appear in various places:

    $
      a_"for example in a subscript" &= "or in a longer text" \
      f(x) &= sin(x)
    $

A no-frills curriculum vitae (CV) template using Typst and YAML to version
control CV data.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=imprecv&version=1.0.1)

[ ![Apache-2
License](https://img.shields.io/badge/Star%20Repo-%E2%AD%90-1081c2.svg)

[ ![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/jskherman/imprecv)
](https://github.com/jskherman/imprecv/releases)

` imprecv ` is a no-frills curriculum vitae (CV) template for [ Typst
](https://github.com/typst/typst) that uses a YAML file for data input in
order to version control CV data easily.

This is based on the [ popular template on Reddit
](https://web.archive.org/https://old.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/)
by [ u/SheetsGiggles
](https://web.archive.org/https://old.reddit.com/user/SheetsGiggles) and the
recommendations of the [ r/EngineeringResumes wiki
](https://web.archive.org/https://old.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/m2cc65/new_and_improved_wiki)
.

==  Demo

See [ *example CV*
](https://github.com/jskherman/imprecv/releases/latest/download/example.pdf)
and [ @jskhermanâs CV ](https://go.jskherman.com/cv) :

![Sample CV Page
1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jskherman/imprecv/main/assets/thumbnail.1.png)
![Sample CV Page
2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jskherman/imprecv/main/assets/thumbnail.2.png)

==  Usage

This ` imprecv ` is intended to be used by importing the templateâs [
package entrypoint
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/imprecv/1.0.1/cv.typ)
from a âcontentâ file (see [ ` template.typ `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/imprecv/1.0.1/template/template.typ)
as an example). In this content file, call the functions which apply document
styles, show CV components, and load CV data from a YAML file (see [ `
template.yml `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/imprecv/1.0.1/template/template.yml)
as an example). Inside the content file you can modify several style variables
and even override existing function implementations to your own needs and
preferences.

===  With the [ Typst CLI ](https://github.com/typst/typst)

The recommended usage with the Typst CLI is by running the command ` typst
init @preview/imprecv:1.0.1 ` in your project directory. This will create a
new Typst project with the ` imprecv ` template and the necessary files to get
started. You can then run ` typst compile template.typ ` to compile your file
to PDF.

Take a look at the [ example setup ](https://github.com/jskherman/cv.typ-
example-repo) for ideas on how to get started. It includes a GitHub action
workflow to compile the Typst files to PDF and upload it to Cloudflare R2.

===  With [ typst.app ](https://typst.app/)

From the Dashboard, select âStart from templateâ, search and choose the `
imprecv ` template. From there, decide on a name for your project and click
âCreateâ. You can now edit the template files and preview the result on
the right.

You can also click the ` Create project in app ` button in [ Typst Universe
](https://typst.app/universe/package/imprecv) to create a new project with the
` imprecv ` template.

==  Contributing

[ Iâm ](https://github.com/jskherman) only doing programming as a hobby so
it might take me a while to respond to issues and pull requests. If you would
like to contribute to this project, I would be happy to review your pull
requests when I can. Thank you for your understanding.

= *funarray.md*

=  funarray

0.4.0

Package providing convenient functional functions to use on arrays.

This package provides some convinient functional functions for [ typst
](https://typst.app/) to use on arrays.

==  Usage

To use this package simply ` #import "@preview/funarray:0.3.0" ` . To import
all functions use ` : * ` and for specific ones, use either the module or as
described in the [ typst docs
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/scripting#modules) .

==  Important note

Almost all functions are one-liners, which could, instead of being loaded via
a package import, also be just copied directly into your source files.

==  Dokumentation

A prettier und easier to read version of the documentation exists in the
example folder, which is done in typst and exported to pdf. Otherwise, bellow
is the markdown version.

==  Functions

Let us define ` a = (1, "not prime", 2, "prime", 3, "prime", 4, "not prime",
5, "prime") `

===  chunks

The chunks function translates the array to an array of array. It groups the
elements to chunks of a given size and collects them in an bigger array.

` chunks(a, 2) = ( (1, "not prime"), (2, "prime"), (3, "prime"), (4, "not
prime"), (5, "prime") ) `

===  unzip

The unzip function is the inverse of the zip method, it transforms an array of
pairs to a pair of vectors. You can also give input an array of ` n ` -tuples
resulting in in ` n ` arrays.

` unzip(b) = ( (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), ( "not prime", "prime", "prime", "not prime",
"prime" ) ) `

===  cycle

The cycle function concatenates the array to itself until it has a given size.



    let c = cycle(range(5), 8)
    c = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2)


Note that there is also the functionality to concatenate with ` + ` and ` * `
in typst.

===  windows and circular-windows

This function provides a running window

` windows(c, 5) = ( (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3, 4, 0), (2, 3, 4, 0, 1), (3, 4,
0, 1, 2) ) `

whereas the circular version wraps over.

` circular-windows(c, 5) = ( (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3, 4, 0), (2, 3, 4, 0,
1), (3, 4, 0, 1, 2), (4, 0, 1, 2, 4), (0, 1, 2, 4, 0), (1, 2, 4, 0, 1), (2, 4,
0, 1, 2) ) `

===  partition and partition-map

The partition function seperates the array in two according to a predicate
function. The result is an array with all elements, where the predicate
returned true followed by an array with all elements, where the predicate
returned false.



    let (primesp, nonprimesp) = partition(b, x => x.at(1) == "prime")
    primesp = ((2, "prime"), (3, "prime"), (5, "prime"))
    nonprimesp = ((1, "not prime"), (4, "not prime"))


There is also a partition-map function, which after partition also applies a
second function on both collections.



    let (primes, nonprimes) = partition-map(b, x => x.at(1) == "prime", x => x.at(0))
    primes = (2, 3, 5)
    nonprimes = (1, 4)


===  group-by

This functions groups according to a predicate into maximally sized chunks,
where all elements have the same predicate value.



    let f = (0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1)
    let g = group-by(f, x => x == 0)
    g = ((0, 0), (1, 1, 1), (0, 0), (1,))


===  flatten

Typst has a ` flatten ` method for arrays, however that method acts
recursively. For instance

` (((1,2,3), (2,3)), ((1,2,3), (1,2))).flatten() = (1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1,
2) `

Normally, one would only have flattened one level. To do this, we can use the
typst array concatenation method +, or by folding, the sum method for arrays:

` (((1,2,3), (2,3)), ((1,2,3), (1,2))).sum() = ((1, 2, 3), (2, 3), (1, 2, 3),
(1, 2)) `

To handle further depth, one can use flatten again, so that in our example:

` (((1,2,3), (2,3)), ((1,2,3), (1,2))).sum().sum() = (((1,2,3), (2,3)),
((1,2,3), (1,2))).flatten() `

===  intersperse

This function has been removed in version 0.3, as typst 0.8 provides such
functionality by default.

===  take-while and skip-while

These functions do exactly as they say.



    take-while(h, x => x < 1) = (0, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75)
    skip-while(h, x => x < 1) = (1, 1, 1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)


==  Unsafe Functions

The core functions are defined in ` funarray-unsafe.typ ` . However,
assertions (error checking) are not there and it is generally not being
advised to use these directly. Still, if being cautious, one can use the
imported ` funarray-unsafe ` module in ` funarray(.typ) ` . All function names
are the same.

To do this from the package, do as follows:



    #import @preview/funarray:0.3.0

    #funarray.funarray-unsafe.chunks(range(10), 3)


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` funarray `



    #import "@preview/funarray:0.4.0"

0.3.0

Create beautiful booklets with ease.

Create beautiful booklets with ease.

The current version of this library (0.3.0) contains a single function to take
in an array of content blocks and order them into a ready to print booklet,
bulletin, etc. No need to fight with printer settings or document converters.

===  Example Output

Here is an example of the output generated by the ` sig ` function (short for
a bookâs signature) with default parameters and some sample content:

![Example1](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/bookletic/0.3.0/example/basic.png)

Here is an example with some customization applied:

![Example2](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/bookletic/0.3.0/example/fancy.png)

==  ` sig ` Function

The ` sig ` function is used to create a signature (booklet) layout from
provided content. It takes various parameters to automatically configure the
layout.

===  Parameters

  - ` page_margin_binding ` : The binding margin for each page in the booklet (space between pages).
  - ` page_border ` : Takes a color space value to draw a border around each page. If set to none no border will be drawn.
  - ` draft ` : A boolean value indicating whether to output an unordered draft or final layout.
  - ` p-num-layout ` : A configuration for page numbering styles, allowing multiple layouts that apply to specified page ranges. Each layout can be provided as a dictonary specifying the following options:
    - ` p-num-start ` : Starting page number for this layout
    - ` p-num-alt-start ` : Alternative starting page number (e.g., for chapters)
    - ` p-num-pattern ` : Pattern for page numbering (e.g., ` "1" ` , ` "i" ` , ` "a" ` , ` "A" ` )
    - ` p-num-placment ` : Placement of page numbers ( ` top ` or ` bottom ` )
    - ` p-num-align-horizontal ` : Horizontal alignment of page numbers ( ` left ` , ` center ` , or ` right ` )
    - ` p-num-align-vertical ` : Vertical alignment of page numbers ( ` top ` , ` horizon ` , or ` bottom ` )
    - ` p-num-pad-left ` : Extra padding added to the left of the page number
    - ` p-num-pad-horizontal ` : Horizontal padding for page numbers
    - ` p-num-size ` : Size of page numbers
    - ` p-num-border ` : The border color for the page numbers. If set to none no border will be drawn.
    - ` p-num-halign-alternate ` : A boolean for whether to alternate horizontal alignment between left and right pages.
  - ` pad_content ` : The padding around the page content.
  - ` contents ` : The content to be laid out in the booklet. This should be an array of blocks.

===  Usage

To use the ` sig ` function, first set your desired page settings using the
native page function. Then simply call the sig function with the desired
parameters and provide the content to be laid out in the booklet:



    #set page(flipped: true, paper: "us-letter")
    #bookletic.sig(
      contents: [
        ["Page 1 content"],
        ["Page 2 content"],
        ["Page 3 content"],
        ["Page 4 content"],
      ],
    )


This will create a signature layout with the provided content, using the
default values for the other parameters.

You can customize the layout by passing different values for the various
parameters. For example:



    #set page(flipped: true, paper: "us-legal", margin: (top: 1in, bottom: 1in, left: 1in, right: 1in))
    #bookletic.sig(
      page_margin_binding: 0.5in,
      page_border: none,
      draft: true,
      p-num-layout: (
        bookletic.num-layout(
          p-num-start: 1,
          p-num-alt-start: none,
          p-num-pattern: "~ 1 ~",
          p-num-placment: bottom,
          p-num-align-horizontal: right,
          p-num-align-vertical: horizon,
          p-num-pad-left: -5pt,
          p-num-pad-horizontal: 0pt,
          p-num-size: 16pt,
          p-num-border: rgb("#ff4136"),
          p-num-halign-alternate: false,
        ),
      ),
      pad_content: 10pt,
      contents: (
        ["Page 1 content"],
        ["Page 2 content"],
        ["Page 3 content"],
        ["Page 4 content"],
      ),
    )


This will create an unordered draft signature layout with US Legal paper size,
larger margins, no page borders, page numbers at the bottom right corner with
a red border, and more padding around the content.

===  Notes

  - The ` sig ` function is currently hardcoded to only handle two-page single-fold signatures. Other more complicated signatures may be supported in the future.
  - The ` num-layout ` function is a helper to create page number layouts with default values.
  - The ` booklet ` function is a placeholder for automatically breaking a single content block into pages dynamically. It is not implemented yet but will be added in coming versions.

==  Collaboration

I would love to see this package eventually turn into a community effort. So
any interest in collaboration is very welcome! You can find the github
repository for this library here: [ Bookletic Repo
](https://github.com/harrellbm/Bookletic) . Feel free to file an issue, pull
request, or start a discussion.

==  Changlog

====  0.3.0

  - Remove internal dependency on native page function. This allows the user to set the page function separately with full control over paper type, outer margins and everything else defined by the native page function.
  - Add p-num-halign-alternate to page number layout allowing setting page numbers to alternate on facing pages making it possible to place page numbers along the outside or inside edges of facing pages.
  - Internal improvements for ordering algorithm.
  - Add ` num-layout ` function helper.

====  0.2.0

  - Handle odd number of pages by inserting a blank back cover
  - Implements page number layouts to allow defining different page numbers for different page ranges.
  - Add various other page number options

====  0.1.0

Featured  Template

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=basic-resume&version=0.2.0)

Version 0.2.0

This is a template for a simple resume. It is intended to be used as a good
starting point for quickly crafting a standard resume that will properly be
parsed by ATS systems. Inspiration is taken from [ Jakeâs Resume

](https://typst.app/universe/package/guided-resume-starter-cgc/) . Iâm
currently a college student and was unable to find a Typst resume template
that fit my needs, so I wrote my own. I hope this template can be useful to
others as well.

There are multiple ways to install the [ shiroa ](https://github.com/Myriad-
Dreamin/shiroa) CLI tool. Choose any one of the methods below that best suit
your needs.

===  Pre-compiled binaries

Executable binaries are available for download on the [ GitHub Releases page
](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/shiroa/releases) . Download the binary for
your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and extract the archive. The archive
contains an ` shiroa ` executable which you can run to build your books.

To make it easier to run, put the path to the binary into your ` PATH ` .

===  Build from source using Rust

To build the ` shiroa ` executable from source, you will first need to install
Yarn, Rust, and Cargo. Follow the instructions on the [ Yarn installation page
](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and [ Rust installation page
](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) . shiroa currently requires at
least Rust version 1.75.

To build with precompiled artifacts, run the following commands:



    cargo install --git https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/shiroa --locked shiroa-cli


To build from source, run the following commands:



    git clone https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/shiroa.git
    git submodule update --recursive --init
    cargo run --bin shiroa-build
    # optional: install it globally
    cargo install --path ./cli


With global installation, to uninstall, run the command ` cargo uninstall
shiroa ` .

Again, make sure to add the Cargo bin directory to your ` PATH ` .

===  Get started

See the [ Get-started ](https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/shiroa/guide/get-
started.html) online documentation.

===  Setup for writing your book

We donât provide a watch command, but ` shiroa ` is designated to embracing
all of the approaches to writing typst documents. Itâs feasible to preview
your documents by following approaches (like previewing normal documents):

  - via [ Official Web App ](https://typst.app/) .

  - via VSCod(e,ium), see [ Tinymist ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) and [ Typst Preview ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgt19937.typst-preview) .

  - via other editors. For example of neovim, see [ typst.vim ](https://github.com/kaarmu/typst.vim) and [ Typst Preview ](https://github.com/Enter-tainer/typst-preview#use-without-vscode) .

  - via ` typst-cli watch ` , See [ typst-cli watch ](https://github.com/typst/typst#usage) .

===  Acknowledgement

  - The [ mdbook theme ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/shiroa/0.1.2/themes/mdbook/) is borrowed from [ mdBook ](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/tree/master/src/theme) project.

  - Compile the document with awesome [ Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) .

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` shiroa `

0.1.0

Unofficial Typst template for PUP (Polytechnic University of the Philippines)
undergraduate thesis manuscript

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=uo-pup-thesis-
manuscript&version=0.1.0)

Unofficial [ typst ](https://typst.app/) template for undergraduate thesis
manuscript for PUP (Polytechnic University of the Philippines). This template
adheres to the Universityâs Thesis and Dissertation Manual as of 2017 (ISBN:
978-971â95208-8-7 (Online)). An example manuscript is also provided (see `
./thesis.pdf ` ).

==  Setup

Using [ Typst CLI ](https://github.com/typst/typst?tab=readme-ov-
file#installation) :



    typst init @preview/uo-pup-thesis-manuscript my-thesis
    cd my-thesis
    typst compile thesis.typ  # to compile to PDF


or run



    typst watch thesis.typ  # to automatically compiles PDF on save


==  Usage

The template already provided an example structure and some guides. But to
start from nothing, make an entrypoint file with a basic structure like this:



    // thesis.typ
    #import "@preview/uo-pup-thesis-manuscript:0.1.0": *


    #show: template.with(
      [<your thesis title here>],
      ("Author 1", "Author 2", ..., "Author N"),
      "name of your college here",
      "name of your deg. program here",
      "Month YYYY"
    )


    // Main content starts here

    // This provides a customized heading for
    // chapters that follows the manual
    #chapter(1, "Chapter 1 Title")

    // Since #chapter() provides a heading level 1,
    // start each headings under chapters with level 2
    // to avoid messing up the generated Table of Contents
    == Introduction

    ...

    #chapter(2, "Chapter 2 Title")

    == Topic A

    ...

    // End of main content


    // Bibliography formatting setup
    #set par(first-line-indent: 0pt, hanging-indent: 0.5in)
    #set page(header: context [#h(1fr) #counter(page).get().first()])
    #align(center)[ #heading("REFERENCES") ]
    #set par(spacing: 1.5em)

    // Get the apa.csl file from `template/` folder
    #bibliography(title: none, style: "./apa.csl", "path/to/your/bibtex/file.bib")


    // Appendices
    #show: appendices-section

    #appendix(1, "Appendix Title")

    ...

    #pagebreak()

    #appendix(2, "Appendix Title")

    ...


There are also provided utilities for some parts that have a specific way of
formatting.

For example, in ` Definition of Terms ` and ` Significance of the Study `
sections, use ` #description ` function:



    == Significance of the Study
    #description(
      (
        (term: [Topic A], desc: [#lorem(30)]),
        (term: [Topic B], desc: [#lorem(30)]),
        (term: [Topic C], desc: [#lorem(30)]),
      )
    )

    ...

    == Definition of Terms
    #description(
      (
        (term: [Topic A], desc: [#lorem(30)]),
        (term: [Topic B], desc: [#lorem(30)]),
      )
    )


- * *

If thereâs any mistakes, wrong formatting (e.g., not actually following the
manual), etc., file an issue or a pull request.

Last name can also start with a royalty connector like âdeâ or âvonâ

` Name 1 ` , ` Name 2 ` will render with the number after the name, but the
number is handled as a last name.

= *iconic-salmon-fa.md*

=  iconic-salmon-fa

1.0.0

A Typst library for Social Media references with icons based on Font Awesome.

The ` iconic-salmon-fa ` package is designed to help you create your
curriculum vitae (CV). It allows you to easily reference your social media
profiles with the typical icon of the service plus a link to your profile.
The package name is a combination of the acronym _SociAL Media icONs_ and the
word _iconic_ because all these icons have an iconic design (and iconic also
contains the word _icon_ ).

==  Features

  - Support for popular social media, developer and career platforms
  - Uniform design for all entries
  - Based on the Internetâs icon library [ Font Awesome ](https://fontawesome.com/)
  - Easy to use
  - Allows the customization of the look (extra args are passed to [ ` text ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/) )

==  Fonts Installation

===  Linux

  1. [ Download Font Awesome for Desktop ](https://fontawesome.com/download)
  2. Unzip the file
  3. Switch into the ` otfs ` folder within the unzipped folder
  4. Run ` mkdir -p /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ `
  5. Run ` install -m644 'Font Awesome 6 Brands-Regular-400.otf' /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ `
  6. Unfortunately not all brands are included in the brands font file, so you must also run ` install -m644 'Font Awesome 6 Free-Regular-400.otf' /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ `

==  Usage

===  Using Typstâs package manager

You can install the library using the [ typst packages
](https://github.com/typst/packages) :



    #import "@preview/iconic-salmon-fa:1.0.0": *


===  Install manually

Put the ` iconic-salmon-fa.typ ` file in your project directory and import it:



    #import "iconic-salmon-fa.typ": *


===  Minimal Example



    // #import "@preview/iconic-salmon-fa:1.0.0": github-info, gitlab-info
    #import "iconic-salmon-fa.typ": github-info, gitlab-info

    This project was created by #github-info("Bi0T1N"). You can also find me on #gitlab-info("GitLab", rgb("#811052"), url: "https://gitlab.com/Bi0T1N").


===  Examples

See the [ ` examples.typ `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/iconic-salmon-
fa/1.0.0/examples/examples.typ) file for a complete example. The [ generated
PDF files
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/iconic-salmon-
fa/1.0.0/examples/) are also available for preview.

=  ofbnote

0.2.0

A document template using French Office for biodiversity design guidelines

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=ofbnote&version=0.2.0)

This is a Typst template to help formatting documents according to the French
office for biodiversity design guidelines.

==  Usage

You can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/ofbnote


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` ofbnote ` function with one named argument called
` meta ` which should be a dictionary of metadata for the document. The ` meta
` dictionary can contain the following fields:

  - ` title ` : The documentâs title as a string or content.
  - ` authors ` : The documentâs author(s) as a string.
  - ` date ` : The documentâs date as a string or content.
  - ` version ` : The documentâs version as a string.

It may contains other values, but they have no effect on the final document.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
paper.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` ofbnote
` function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use
this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/ofbnote:0.2.0": *

    #show: ofbnote.with( meta:(
      title: "My note",
      authors: "Me",
      date: "March 23rd, 2023",
      version: "1.0"
    ))

template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/guided-resume-
starter-cgc-2.0.0-small.webp)

2.0.0

A guided starter resume for people looking to focus on highlighting their
experience -- without having to worry about the hassle of formatting.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=guided-resume-starter-
cgc&version=2.0.0)

This template is a starter resume for people looking to focus on the content
of their resume, without having to worry about the hassle of formatting.

==  Get Started!

===  Quickstart: Typst Universe

  1. If you havenât already, [ create a (free!) Typst account ](https://typst.app/) .
  2. Once you have an account, go to the template on [ Typst Universe ](https://typst.app/universe/package/resume-starter-cgc)
  3. Click on âCreate Project in Appâ, give your project a title, and press âCreateâ.
  4. Start editing! This copy is your own personal copy to edit however you want!

There are two files included in this project:

  - ` starter.typ ` contains the full template, along with a written guide to help you put your best (single-paged) foot forward!
  - ` resume.typ ` is the same template, but without the full guide included.
  - ` templates/resume.template.typ ` contains the formatting and style for the underlying pieces.

*I would highly recommend reading` starter.typ ` or skimming through the [
online guide ](https://blog.chaoticgood.computer/writing/notes/typst-resume-
template) to understand best practices when using the template. *

===  Alternative: Typst CLI

If youâd prefer to simply download & modify the template, you can use the [
Typst CLI ](https://github.com/typst/typst) to download it instead:



    typst init @preview/resume-starter-cgc


==  Layout

===  Header

The resume can be created with a header with the following attributes:

  - ` author ` : Your name
  - ` location ` : The city, state/province, and country you reside in.
  - ` contacts ` : A list of contact information and additional information

====  Header Example



    #show: resume.with(
      author: "Dr. Emmit \"Doc\" Brown",
      location: "Hill Valley, CA",
      contacts: (
        [#link("mailto:your_email@yourmail.com")[Email]],
        [#link("https://your-cool-site.com")[Website]],
        [#link("https://github.com/your-linkedin")[GitHub]],
        [#link("https://linkedin.com/in/your-linkedin")[LinkedIn]],
      )
    )


===  Education

The Education ( ` #edu ` ) section can be used to highlight for formal
education and certifications.

  - ` institution ` : Name of the institution where you study, or have graduated from.
  - ` date ` : Your graduation date, or expected graduation date.
  - ` degrees ` : The degrees you received at the institution
    - Each entry is two sections: the *title* of the degree, and the *subject* that you studied.
  - ` gpa ` (optional): Your GPA, or other additional information.

====  Education Example



    #edu(
      institution: "University of Colombia",
      date: "Aug 1948",
      gpa: "3.9 of 4.0, Summa Cum Laude",
      degrees: (
        ("Bachelor's of Science", "Nuclear Engineering"),
        ("Minors", "Automobile Design, Arabic"),
        ("Focus", "Childcare, Education")
      ),
    )


===  Skills

An additional Skills ( ` #skills ` ) section to list skills relevant to the
job youâre applying for.

The input is a list of ` Label: Skills[] ` , in order to easily toggle
comments on skills that you may want to leave in but not render for a
particular application.

====  Skills Example



    #skills((
      ("Expertise", (
        [Theoretical Physics],
        [Time Travel],
        [Nuclear Material Management],
        [Student Mentoring],
      )),
      ("Software", (
        [AutoDesk CAD],
        [Delorean OS],
        [Windows 1],
      )),
      ("Languages", (
        [C++],
        [C Language],
        [MatLab],
        [Punch Cards],
      )),
    ))


===  Experience

The bulk of your resume, the Experience ( ` #exp ` ) sections provide a
compact & concise formatting for bulleted details of your previous and current
work experience.

This section is meant to be flexible, and can also be used to talk about
projects and other experiences that may fall outside of the traditional
definition of âwork.â

  - ` role ` : The title of your position/role in this experience.
  - ` project ` : The company you worked at, or the name of the project you worked on.
  - ` date ` : The start and end dates of this experience.
  - ` details ` : A description of the work you did in this position
    - It is *highly encouraged* to use bullet points in this section.
  - ` location ` (optional): The location of the experience
  - ` summary ` (optional): A brief summary of the companyâs mission or project goal.

====  Experience Example



    #exp(
      role: "Theoretical Physics Consultant",
      project: "Doc Brown's Garage",
      date: "June 1953 - Oct 2015",
      location: "Hill Valley, CA",
      summary: "Specializing in development of time travel devices and student tutoring",
      details: [
        - Lead development of time travel devices, resulting in the ability to travel back and forth through time
        - Managed and executed a budget of \$14 million dollars gained from an unexplained family fortune
        - Oversaw QA testing for time travel devices, minimizing risk of maternal time-travel related incidents
      ]

= *numblex.md*

=  numblex

0.2.0

Numbering helper.

How to number the heading like this?

  - Appendix A. XXXX
    - A.1. YYY
    - A.2. ZZZ

Or this?

  - ä¸ãè¯é¢
    - 1\. è®ºç¹
      - (1) è¯æ®

You might use a function:



    #set heading(numbering: (..nums) => {
      if nums.pos().len() == 1 {
        return "Appendix " + numbering("A.", ..nums)
      }
      return numbering("A.1.", ..nums)
    }


Or set up a couple of ` set ` rules:



    #set heading(numbering: "A.1.")
    #show heading.where(level: 1): set heading(numbering: (n) => "Appendix " + numbering("A.", n))
    // No, you can't use "Appendix A." since Typst would treat the first "A" as a numbering


Or simply use Numblex:



    #import "@preview/numblex:0.2.0": numblex

    #set heading(numbering: numblex("{Appendix [A].:d==1;[A].}{[1].}"))


==  Usage



    #import "@preview/numblex:0.2.0": numblex

    #set heading(numbering: numblex("{Section [A].:d==1;[A].}{[1].}{[1])}"))



You can read the [ Manual
](https://github.com/ParaN3xus/numblex/blob/main/manual.pdf) for more
information.

===  How to add

==  How to Compile

This project contains an example setup that splits individual chapters into
different files.
This can cause problems when using references etc.
These problems can be avoided by following these steps:

  - Make sure to always compile your ` main.typ ` file which includes all of your chapters for references to work correctly.
  - VSCode:
    - Install the [ Tinymist Typst ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extension.
    - Make sure to start the ` PDF ` or ` Live Preview ` only from within your ` main.typ ` file.
    - If problems occur it usually helps to close the preview and restart it from your ` main.typ ` file.

    	/* Additional content and their defaults
     	kraj: "Koper",
    	*/
    )

    // Your content goes below.



==  Abbreviations (kratice)

You can specify Abbreviations at the start as an attribute ` kratice ` and
pass it a dictionary of the abbriviation and itâs explanation. Then you can
reference them in text using ` @<short name> ` to create a link to it.

==  Attachments

Some thesis need Attachments that are shown at the end of the file. To add
these attachments add them in your project under ` priloge ` as a dictionary
of the attachment name and its content. I suggest having a seperate `
attachments.typ ` file, from where you can reference them in the main project.

==  Language

The writing of the thesis can be achieved in two languages; Slovene and
English. They have some differences between them in the way the template is
generated, as the thesis needs to be different for each one. you can specify
the language with the ` text_lang ` attribute.

= *syntree.md*

=  syntree

0.2.0

Linguistics syntax/parse tree rendering

*syntree* is a typst package for rendering syntax trees / parse trees (the
kind linguists use).

The name and syntax are inspired by Miles Shangâs [ syntree
](https://github.com/mshang/syntree) . Hereâs an example to get started:



    #import "@preview/syntree:0.2.0": syntree

    #syntree(
      nonterminal: (font: "Linux Biolinum"),
      terminal: (fill: blue),
      child-spacing: 3em, // default 1em
      layer-spacing: 2em, // default 2.3em
      "[S [NP This] [VP [V is] [^NP a wug]]]"
    )


|  ![Output tree for "This is a wug"](https://github.com/lynn/typst-
syntree/assets/16232127/d0c680b2-4fd0-420f-b350-9e9c96ac37f3)
---|---

Thereâs limited support for formulas inside nodes; try `
#syntree("[DP$zws_i$ this]") ` or ` #syntree("[C $diameter$]") ` .

For more flexible tree-drawing, use ` tree ` :



    #import "@preview/syntree:0.2.0": tree

    #let bx(col) = box(fill: col, width: 1em, height: 1em)
    #tree("colors",
      tree("warm", bx(red), bx(orange)),
      tree("cool", bx(blue), bx(teal)))

==  Introduction

With ` chordx ` you can easily generate song lyrics with chords for writing
songbooks.

` chordx ` generates chord charts for stringed instruments (e.g. guitar,
ukulele, etc.), piano chords (with diferent piano layouts) and single chords
that are chords without charts used to write the chords over a word to write
songbooks.

==  Usage

` chordx ` exports 3 functions to generate diferents types fo charts:

  - ` chart-chord ` : used to generate chart chords for stringed instruments.
  - ` piano-chord ` : used to generate piano chords.
  - ` single-chord ` : used to show the chord name over a word.

===  Typst Packages

Create hidden bibliographies or bibliographies with unmentioned (hidden)
citations.

[ GitHub Repository including Examples ](https://github.com/pklaschka/typst-
hidden-bib)

A Typst package to create hidden bibliographies or bibliographies with
unmentioned (hidden) citations.

==  Use Cases

===  Hidden Bibliographies

In some documents, such as a letter, you may want to cite a reference without
printing a bibliography.

This can easily be achieved by wrapping your ` bibliography(...) ` with the `
hidden-bibliography ` function after importing the ` hidden-bib ` package.

The code then looks like this:



    #import "@preview/hidden-bib:0.1.0": hidden-bibliography

    #lorem(20) @example1
    #lorem(40) @example2[p. 2]

    #hidden-bibliography(
      bibliography("/refs.yml")
    )


_Note that this automatically sets the` style ` option to ` "chicago-notes" `
unless you specify a different style. _

===  Hidden Citations

In some documents, it may be necessary to include items in your bibliography
which werenât explicitly cited at any specific point in your document.

The code then looks like this:



    #import "@preview/hidden-bib:0.1.0": hidden-cite

    #hidden-cite("example1")


===  Multiple Hidden Citations

If you want to include a large number of items in your bibliography without
having to use ` hidden-cite ` (to still get autocompletion in the web editor),
you can use the ` hidden-citations ` environment.

The code then looks like this:



    #import "@preview/hidden-bib:0.1.0": hidden-citations

    #hidden-citations[
      @example1
      @example2
    ]


==  FAQ

===  Why would I want to have hidden citations and a hidden bibliography?

You donât. While this package solves both (related) problems, you should
only use one of them at a time. Otherwise, youâll simply see nothing at all.

===  Why would I want to have hidden citations?

Thatâs for you to decide. It essentially enables you to include âuncited
referencesâ, similar to LaTeXâs ` \nocite{} ` command.

0.1.0

Julia code evaluation inside your Typst document

![logo](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/jlyfish/0.1.0/assets/logo.svg)

Jlyfish is a package for Julia and Typst that allows you to integrate Julia
computations in your Typst document.

[ ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-wiki-blue)
](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/TypstJlyfish.jl/wiki) ![GitHub
License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/andreasKroepelin/TypstJlyfish.jl)
![GitHub release \(latest by
date\)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/andreasKroepelin/TypstJlyfish.jl)
[ ![GitHub Repo
stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/andreasKroepelin/TypstJlyfish.jl)
](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/TypstJlyfish.jl)

You should use Jlyfish if you want to write a Typst document and have some of
the content automatically produced by Julia code but want the source code for
that within your document source. It fills a similar role as [ PythonTeX
](https://github.com/gpoore/pythontex) does for Python and LaTeX. Note that
this is different from tools like [ Quarto ](https://quarto.org/) where you
write documents in Markdown, also integrate some Julia code, but then might
use Typst only as a backend to produce the final document.

See below for a quick introduction or read the [ wiki
](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/TypstJlyfish.jl/wiki) for an in depth
explanation.

Since Jlyfish builds a bridge between Julia and Typst, we also have to get two
things running. First, install the Julia package ` TypstJlyfish ` from the
general registry by executing



    julia> ]

    (@v1.10) pkg> add TypstJlyfish


You only have to do this once. (It is like installing and using the Pluto
notebook system, if you are familiar with that.)

When you want to use Jlyfish in a Typst document (say, ` your-document.typ `
), add the following line at the top:



    #import "@preview/jlyfish:0.1.0": *


Then, open a Julia REPL and run



    julia> import TypstJlyfish

    julia> TypstJlyfish.watch("your-document.typ")


Jlyfish facilitates the communication between Julia and Typst via a JSON file.
By default, Jlyfish uses the name of your document and adds a ` -jlyfish.json
` , so ` your-document.typ ` would become ` your-document-jlyfish.json ` .
This can be configured, of course.

To let Typst know of the computed data in the JSON file, add the following
line to your document:



    #read-julia-output(json("your-document-jlyfish.json"))


You can then place some Julia code in your Typst source using the ` #jl `
function:



    What is the sum of the whole numbers from one to a hundred? #jl(`sum(1:100)`)

= *acrostiche.md*

=  acrostiche

0.4.1

Manage acronyms and their definitions in Typst.

Manages acronyms so you donât have to.

==  Quick Start



    #import "@preview/acrostiche:0.4.0": *

    #init-acronyms((
      "WTP": ("Wonderful Typst Package","Wonderful Typst Packages"),
    ))

    Acrostiche is a #acr("WTP")! This #acr("WTP") enables easy acronyms manipulation.

    Its main features are auto-expansion of the first occurence, global or selective expansion reset #reset-all-acronyms(), implicit or manual plural form support (there may be multiple #acrpl("WTP")), and customizable index printing. Have Fun!


==  Usage

The main goal of Acrostiche is to keep track of which acronyms to define.

===  Define acronyms

All acronyms used with Acrostiche must be defined in a dictionary passed to
the ` init-acronyms ` function. There are two possible forms for the
definition, depending on the required features.

====  Simple Definitions

For a quick and easy definion, you can use the acronym to display as the key
and an array of one or more strings as the singular and plural versions of the
expanded meaning of the acronym.



    #init-acronyms((
      "SDA": ("Simply Defined Acronym","Simply Defined Acronyms"),
      "ASDA": ("Another Simply Defined Acronym","Another Simply Defined Acronyms"),
    ))


If there is only a singular version of the definition, the array contains only
one value. If there are both singular and plural versions, define the
definition as an array where the first item is the singular definition and the
second item is the plural.

====  Advanced Definitions

If you find yourself needing more flexibility when defining the acronyms, you
can pass a dictionary for each acronym. The expected keys are: ` short ` the
singular short form to display, ` short-pl ` the plural short form, ` long `
singular long (expanded) form to display, and ` long-pl ` the plural long
form. The main benefit of this definition is to use a separate key for calling
the acronym, useful when acronyms are long and tedious to write.



    #init-acronyms((
      "la": (
    short: "LATATW",
    long: "Long And Tedious Acronym To Write",
    short-pl: "LATAsTW",
    long-pl: "Long And Tedious Acronyms To Write"),
    ))


Any other keys than these will be discarded.

===  Call Acrostiche functions

Once the acronyms are defined, you can use them in the text with the `
#acr(...) ` function. The argument is the acronym as a string (for example,
âBIOSâ). On the first call of the function, it prints the acronym with its
definition (for example, âBasic Input/Output System (BIOS)â). On the next
calls, it prints only the acronym.

To get the plural version of the acronym, you can use the ` #acrpl(...) `
function that adds an âsâ after the acronym. If a plural version of the
definition is provided, it will be used if the first use of the acronym is
plural. Otherwise, the singular version is used, and a trailing âsâ is
added.

To intentionally print the full version of the acronym (definition + acronym,
as for the first instance), without affecting the state, you can use the `
#acrfull(...) ` function. For the plural version, use the ` #acrfullpl(...) `
function. Both functions have shortcuts with ` #acrf(...) ` and ` #acrfpl(...)
` .

At any point in the document, you can reset acronyms with the functions `
#reset-acronym(...) ` (for a single acronym) or ` reset-all-acronyms() ` (to
reset all acronyms). After a reset, the next use of the acronym is expanded.
Both functions have shortcuts with ` #racr(...) ` and ` #raacr(...) ` .

You can also print an index of all acronyms used in the document with the ` #print-index() ` function. The index is printed as a section for which you can choose the heading level, the numbering, and the outline parameters (with respectively the ` level: int ` , ` numbering: none | string | function ` , and ` outlined: bool ` parameters). You can also choose their order with the ` sorted: string ` parameter that accepts either an empty string (print in the order they are defined), âupâ (print in ascending alphabetical order), or âdownâ (print in descending alphabetical order). By default, the index contains all the acronyms you defined. You can choose to only display acronyms that are actually used in the document by passing ` used-only: true ` to the function. Warning, the detection of used acronym uses the states at the end of the document. Thus, if you reset an acronym and do not use it again until the end, it will not appear in the index. You can use the ` title: string ` parameter to change the name of the heading for the index section. The default value is âAcronyms Indexâ. Passing an empty string for ` title ` results in the index having no heading (i.e., no section for the index). You can customize the string displayed after the acronym in the list with the ` delimiter: ":" ` parameter. To adjust the spacing between the acronyms adjust the ` row-gutter: auto | int | relative | fraction | array ` parameter, the default is ` 2pt ` .

Finally, you can call the ` #display-def(...) ` function to display the
definition of an acronym. Set the ` plural ` parameter to true to get the
plural version.

===  Functions Summary:

*Function* |  *Description*
---|---
*#init-acronyms(â¦)* |  Initializes the acronyms by defining them in a dictionary where the keys are acronyms and the values are definitions.
*#acr(â¦)* |  Prints the acronym with its definition on the first call, then just the acronym in subsequent calls.
*#acrpl(â¦)* |  Prints the plural version of the acronym. Uses plural definition if available, otherwise adds an âsâ to the acronym.
*#acrfull(â¦)* |  Displays the full (long) version of the acronym without affecting the state or tracking its usage.
*#acrfullpl(â¦)* |  Displays the full plural version of the acronym without affecting the state or tracking its usage.
*#reset-acronym(â¦)* |  Resets a single acronym so the next usage will include its definition again.
*#reset-all-acronyms()* |  Resets all acronyms so the next usage will include their definitions again.
*#print-index(â¦)* |  Prints an index of all acronyms used, with customizable heading level, order, and display parameters.
*#display-def(â¦)* |  Displays the definition of an acronym. Use ` plural: true ` to display the plural version of the definition.
*racr, raacr, acrf, acrfpl* |  Shortcuts names for respectively ` reset-acronym ` , ` reset-all-acronyms ` , ` acrfull ` , and ` acrfullpl ` .

==  Advanced Definitions

This is a bit of a hacky feature coming from pure serendipity. There is no
enforcement of the type of the definitions. Most users would naturally use
strings as definitions, but any other content is acceptable. For example, you
set your definition to a content block with rainbow-fille text, or even an
image. The rainbow text is kinda cool because the gradient depend on the
position in the page so depending on the position of first use the acronym
will have a pseudo-random color.

If you use anything else than string for the definition, do not forget the
trailing comma to force the definition to be an array (an array of a single
element is not an array in Typst at the time of writing this). I cannot
guarantee that arbitrary content will remain available in future versions but
I will do my best to keep it as it is kinda cool. If you find cool uses,
please reach out to show me!

> Yes it is posible to build nest/recursive acronyms definitions. If you point
> to another acronym, it all works fine. If you point to the same acronym, you
> obviously create a recursive situation, and it fails. It will not converge,
> and the compiler will warn you and will panic. Be nice to the compiler,
> don't throw recursive traps.

Here is a minimal working example of funky acronyms:



    #import "@preview/acrostiche:0.4.0": *
    #init-acronyms((
      "RFA": ([#text(fill: gradient.linear(..color.map.rainbow))[Rainbow Filled Acronym]],),
      "NA": ([Nested #acr("RFA") Acronym],)
    ))
    #acr("NA")


==  Possible Errors:

  - If an acronym is not defined, an error will tell you which one is causing the error. Simply add it to the dictionary or check the spelling.
  - ` display-def ` leverages the state ` display ` function and only works if the return value is actually printed in the document. For more information on states, see the Typst documentation on states.
  - Acrostiche uses a state named ` acronyms ` to keep track of the definitions and usage. If you redefined this state or use it manually in your document, unexpacted behaviour might happen.

![A preview of the apa7-ish Typst
template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/apa7-ish-0.2.0-small.webp)

=  apa7-ish

0.2.0

Typst Template that (mostly) complies with APA7 Style (Work in Progress).

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=apa7-ish&version=0.2.0)

[ Typst ](https://typst.app/) Template that (mostly) complies with APA7 Style
(Work in Progress).

The template does not follow all recommendations by the APA Manual, especially
when the suggestions break with typographic conventions (such as double line
spacing :vomiting_face:). Instead, the goal of this template is that it
generates you a high-quality manuscript that has all the important components
of the APA7 format, but is aesthetically pleasing.

The following works already quite well:

  - consistent and simple typesetting
  - correct display of author information / author note
  - citations anfalsed references
  - Page headers and footers (show short title in header)
  - Option to anonymize the paper
  - Tables: consisting of 3 parts (caption, content, and table notes)

This is still not finished:

  - figures
  - complete pandoc integration (template for pandoc to replace Latex-based workflows)
  - automatic calculation of page margins (like memoir-class for Latex)

The easiest way to get started is to edit the example file, which has sensible
default values. Most fields in the configuration are optional and will safely
be ignored (not rendered) when you set them to ` none ` .

==  Authors

The ` authors ` setting expects an array of dictionaries with the following
fields:



    (
      name: "First Name Last Name", // Name of author as it should appear on the paper title page
      affiliation: "University, Department", // affiliation(s) of author as it should appear on the title page
      orcid: "0000-0000-0000-0000", // optional for author note
      corresponding: true, // optional to mark an author as corresponding author
      email: "email@upenn.edu", // optional email address, required if author is corresponding
      postal: "Longer string", // optional postal address for corresponding author
    )


Note that the ` affiliation ` field also accepts an array, in case an author
has several affiliations:



    (
      name: "First Name Last Name",
      affiliation: ("University A", "University B")
      ...
    )


==  Anonymization

Sometimes you need to submit a paper without any author information. In such
cases you can set ` anonymous ` to ` true ` .

==  Tables

The template has basic support for tables with a handful of utilities.
Analogous to the [ Latex booktabs package ](https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs) ,
there are pre-defined horizontal lines (ârulesâ):

  - ` #toprule ` : used at the top of the table, before the first row
  - ` #midrule ` : used to separate the header row, or to separate a totals row at the bottom
  - ` #bottomrule ` : used after the last row (technically the same as toprule, but may be useful later to define custom behaviour)

Addtionally, there is a ` #tablenote ` function to be used to place a table
note below the table.

A minimal usage example (taken from the typst documentation):



    // wrap everything in a #figure
    #figure(
      [
        #table(
          columns: 2,
          align: left,
          toprule, // separate table from other content
          table.header([Amount], [Ingredient]),
          midrule, // separation between table header and body
          [360g], [Baking flour],
          [250g], [Butter (room temp.)],
          [150g], [Brown sugar],
          [100g], [Cane sugar],
          [100g], [70% cocoa chocolate],
          [100g], [35-40% cocoa chocolate],
          [2], [Eggs],
          [Pinch], [Salt],
          [Drizzle], [Vanilla extract],
          bottomrule // separation after the last row
        )
        // tablenote goes after the #table
        #tablenote([Here are some additional notes.])
      ],
      // caption is part of the #figure
      caption: [Here is the table caption]
    )

= *prequery.md*

=  prequery

0.1.0

library for extracting metadata for preprocessing from a typst document

This package helps extracting metadata for preprocessing from a typst
document, for example image URLs for download from the web. Typst compilations
are sandboxed: it is not possible for Typst packages, or even just a Typst
document itself, to access the âouside worldâ. This sandboxing of Typst
has good reasons. Yet, it is often convenient to trade a bit of security for
convenience by weakening it. Prequery helps with that by providing some simple
scaffolding for supporting preprocessing of documents.

Hereâs an example for referencing images from the internet:



    #import "@preview/prequery:0.1.0"

    // toggle this comment or pass `--input prequery-fallback=true` to enable fallback
    // #prequery.fallback.update(true)

    #prequery.image(
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png",
      "assets/wikipedia.png")


Using ` typst query ` , the image URL(s) are extracted from the document:



    typst query --input prequery-fallback=true --field value \
        main.typ ''


This will output the following piece of JSON:



    [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "path": "assets/wikipedia.png"}]


Which can then be used to download all images to the expected locations.

See the [ manual
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/prequery/0.1.0/docs/manual.pdf)
for details.

===  How to add

0.1.1

Chinese lipsum text generator; ä¸­æä¹±æ°åæï¼Lorem Ipsumï¼çæå¨

` kouhu ` is a Chinese lipsum text generator for [ Typst ](https://typst.app/)
. It provides a set of built-in text samples containing both Simplified and
Traditional Chinese characters. You can choose from generated fake text,
classic or modern Chinese literature, or specify your own text.

` kouhu ` is inspired by [ zhlipsum ](https://ctan.org/pkg/zhlipsum) LaTeX
package and [ roremu ](https://typst.app/universe/package/roremu) Typst
package.

All [ sample text
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/kouhu/0.1.1/data/zhlipsum.json)
is excerpted from ` zhlipsum ` LaTeX package (see Appendix for details).

==  Usage



    #import "@preview/kouhu:0.1.0": kouhu

    #kouhu(indicies: range(1, 3)) // select the first 3 paragraphs from default text

    #kouhu(builtin-text: "zhufu", offset: 5, length: 100) // select 100 characters from the 5th paragraph of "zhufu" text

    #kouhu(custom-text: ("Foo", "Bar")) // provide your own text


See [ manual ](https://github.com/Harry-Chen/kouhu/blob/master/doc/manual.pdf)
for more details.

==  What does ` kouhu ` mean?

GitHub Copilot says:

> ` kouhu ` (å£è¡) is a Chinese term for reading aloud without understanding
> the meaning. It is often used in the context of learning Chinese language or
> reciting Chinese literature.

==  Changelog

===  0.1.1

  - Fix genearation of ` indicies ` when not specified by user.
  - Add repetition of text until ` length ` is reached.

===  0.1.0

  - Initial release.

==  Appendix

===  Generating ` zhlipsum.json `

First download the ` zhlipsum-text.dtx ` from [ CTAN
](https://ctan.org/pkg/zhlipsum) or from local TeX Live ( ` kpsewhich
zhlipsum-text.dtx ` ). Then run:



    python3 utils/generate_zhlipsum.py /path/to/zhlipsum-text.dtx src/zhlipsum.json


===  How to add

    - [ ` group ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/#group)

==  Input Format and Creation

The ` tabut ` function takes input in ârecordâ format, an array of
dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a single âobjectâ or
ârecordâ.

In the example below, each record is a listing for an office supply product.



    #let supplies = (
      (name: "Notebook", price: 3.49, quantity: 5),
      (name: "Ballpoint Pens", price: 5.99, quantity: 2),
      (name: "Printer Paper", price: 6.99, quantity: 3),
    )


==  Basic Table

Now create a basic table from the data.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies, // the source of the data used to generate the table
      ( // column definitions
        (
          header: [Name], // label, takes content.
          func: r => r.name // generates the cell content.
        ),
        (header: [Price], func: r => r.price),
        (header: [Quantity], func: r => r.quantity),
      )
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/basic.svg)

` funct ` takes a function which generates content for a given cell
corrosponding to the defined column for each record. ` r ` is the record, so `
r => r.name ` returns the ` name ` property of each record in the input data
if it has one.

The philosphy of ` tabut ` is that the display of data should be simple and
clearly defined, therefore each column and itâs content and formatting
should be defined within a single clear column defintion. One consequence is
you can comment out, remove or move, any column easily, for example:



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: [Price], func: r => r.price), // This column is moved to the front
        (header: [Name], func: r => r.name),
        (header: [Name 2], func: r => r.name), // copied
        // (header: [Quantity], func: r => r.quantity), // removed via comment
      )
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/rearrange.svg)

==  Table Styling

Any default Table style options can be tacked on and are passed to the final
table function.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: [Name], func: r => r.name),
        (header: [Price], func: r => r.price),
        (header: [Quantity], func: r => r.quantity),
      ),
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/styling.svg)

==  Header Formatting

You can pass any content or expression into the header property.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #let fmt(it) = {
      heading(
        outlined: false,
        upper(it)
      )
    }

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: fmt([Name]), func: r => r.name ),
        (header: fmt([Price]), func: r => r.price),
        (header: fmt([Quantity]), func: r => r.quantity),
      ),
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/title.svg)

==  Remove Headers

You can prevent from being generated with the ` headers ` paramater. This is
useful with the ` tabut-cells ` function as demonstrated in itâs section.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: [*Name*], func: r => r.name),
        (header: [*Price*], func: r => r.price),
        (header: [*Quantity*], func: r => r.quantity),
      ),
      headers: false, // Prevents Headers from being generated
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none,
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/no-headers.svg)

==  Cell Expressions and Formatting

Just like the headers, cell contents can be modified and formatted like any
content in Typst.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "usd.typ": usd
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: [*Name*], func: r => r.name ),
        (header: [*Price*], func: r => usd(r.price)),
      ),
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/format.svg)

You can have the cell content function do calculations on a record property.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "usd.typ": usd
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: [*Name*], func: r => r.name ),
        (header: [*Price*], func: r => usd(r.price)),
        (header: [*Tax*], func: r => usd(r.price * .2)),
        (header: [*Total*], func: r => usd(r.price * 1.2)),
      ),
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/calculation.svg)

Or even combine multiple record properties, go wild.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut

    #let employees = (
        (id: 3251, first: "Alice", last: "Smith", middle: "Jane"),
        (id: 4872, first: "Carlos", last: "Garcia", middle: "Luis"),
        (id: 5639, first: "Evelyn", last: "Chen", middle: "Ming")
    );

    #tabut(
      employees,
      (
        (header: [*ID*], func: r => r.id ),
        (header: [*Full Name*], func: r => [#r.first #r.middle.first(), #r.last] ),
      ),
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/combine.svg)

==  Index

` tabut ` automatically adds an ` _index ` property to each record.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: [*\#*], func: r => r._index),
        (header: [*Name*], func: r => r.name ),
      ),
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/index.svg)

You can also prevent the ` index ` property being generated by setting it to `
none ` , or you can also set an alternate name of the index property as shown
below.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,

    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/tablex.svg)

While technically seperate from table display, the following are examples of
how to perform operations on data before it is displayed with ` tabut ` .

Since ` tabut ` assumes an âarray of dictionariesâ format, then most data
operations can be performed easily with Typstâs native array functions. `
tabut ` also provides several functions to provide additional functionality.

==  CSV Data

By default, imported CSV gives a ârowsâ or âarray of arraysâ data
format, which can not be directly used by ` tabut ` . To convert, ` tabut `
includes a function ` rows-to-records ` demonstrated below.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut, rows-to-records
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #let titanic = {
      let titanic-raw = csv("example-data/titanic.csv");
      rows-to-records(
        titanic-raw.first(), // The header row
        titanic-raw.slice(1, -1), // The rest of the rows
      )
    }


Imported CSV data are all strings, so itâs usefull to convert them to ` int
` or ` float ` when possible.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut, rows-to-records
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #let auto-type(input) = {
      let is-int = (input.match(regex("^-?\d+$")) != none);
      if is-int { return int(input); }
      let is-float = (input.match(regex("^-?(inf|nan|\d+|\d*(\.\d+))$")) != none);
      if is-float { return float(input) }
      input
    }

    #let titanic = {
      let titanic-raw = csv("example-data/titanic.csv");
      rows-to-records( titanic-raw.first(), titanic-raw.slice(1, -1) )
      .map( r => {
        let new-record = (:);
        for (k, v) in r.pairs() { new-record.insert(k, auto-type(v)); }
        new-record
      })
    }


` tabut ` includes a function, ` records-from-csv ` , to automatically perform
this process.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": records-from-csv

    #let titanic = records-from-csv(csv("example-data/titanic.csv"));

==  ` tabut `

Takes data and column definitions and outputs a table.



    tabut(
      data-raw,
      colDefs,
      columns: auto,
      align: auto,
      index: "_index",
      transpose: false,
      headers: true,
      ..tableArgs
    ) -> content


===  Parameters

` data-raw `
This is the raw data that will be used to generate the table. The data is
expected to be in an array of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a
single record or object.

` colDefs `
These are the column definitions. An array of dictionaries, each representing
column definition. Must include the properties ` header ` and a ` func ` . `
header ` expects content, and specifies the label of the column. ` func `
expects a function, the function takes a record dictionary as input and
returns the value to be displayed in the cell corresponding to that record and
column. There are also two optional properties; ` align ` sets the alignment
of the content within the cells of the column, ` width ` sets the width of the
column.

` columns `
(optional, default: ` auto ` ) Specifies the column widths. If set to ` auto `
, the function automatically generates column widths by each columnâs column
definition. Otherwise functions exactly the ` columns ` paramater of the
standard Typst ` table ` function. Unlike the ` tabut-cells ` setting this to
` none ` will break.

` align `
(optional, default: ` auto ` ) Specifies the column alignment. If set to `
auto ` , the function automatically generates column alignment by each
columnâs column definition. If set to ` none ` no ` align ` property is
added to the output arg. Otherwise functions exactly the ` align ` paramater
of the standard Typst ` table ` function.

` index `
(optional, default: ` "_index" ` ) Specifies the property name for the index
of each record. By default, an ` _index ` property is automatically added to
each record. If set to ` none ` , no index property is added.

` transpose `
(optional, default: ` false ` ) If set to ` true ` , transposes the table,
swapping rows and columns.

` headers `
(optional, default: ` true ` ) Determines whether headers should be included
in the output. If set to ` false ` , headers are not generated.

` tableArgs `
(optional) Any additional arguments are passed to the ` table ` function, can
be used for styling or anything else.

==  ` tabut-cells `

The ` tabut-cells ` function functions as ` tabut ` , but returns ` arguments
` for use in either the standard ` table ` function or other tools such as `
tablex ` . If you just want the array of cells, use the ` pos ` function on
the returned value, ex ` tabut-cells(...).pos ` .

` tabut-cells ` is particularly useful when you need to generate only the cell
contents of a table or when these cells need to be passed to another function
for further processing or customization.

===  Function Signature



    tabut-cells(
      data-raw,
      colDefs,
      columns: auto,
      align: auto,
      index: "_index",
      transpose: false,
      headers: true,
    ) -> arguments


===  Parameters

` data-raw `
This is the raw data that will be used to generate the table. The data is
expected to be in an array of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a
single record or object.

` colDefs `
These are the column definitions. An array of dictionaries, each representing
column definition. Must include the properties ` header ` and a ` func ` . `
header ` expects content, and specifies the label of the column. ` func `
expects a function, the function takes a record dictionary as input and
returns the value to be displayed in the cell corresponding to that record and
column. There are also two optional properties; ` align ` sets the alignment
of the content within the cells of the column, ` width ` sets the width of the
column.

` columns `
(optional, default: ` auto ` ) Specifies the column widths. If set to ` auto `
, the function automatically generates column widths by each columnâs column
definition. If set to ` none ` no ` column ` property is added to the output
arg. Otherwise functions exactly the ` columns ` paramater of the standard
typst ` table ` function.

` align `
(optional, default: ` auto ` ) Specifies the column alignment. If set to `
auto ` , the function automatically generates column alignment by each
columnâs column definition. If set to ` none ` no ` align ` property is
added to the output arg. Otherwise functions exactly the ` align ` paramater
of the standard typst ` table ` function.

` index `
(optional, default: ` "_index" ` ) Specifies the property name for the index
of each record. By default, an ` _index ` property is automatically added to
each record. If set to ` none ` , no index property is added.

` transpose `
(optional, default: ` false ` ) If set to ` true ` , transposes the table,
swapping rows and columns.

` headers `
(optional, default: ` true ` ) Determines whether headers should be included
in the output. If set to ` false ` , headers are not generated.

==  ` records-from-csv `

Automatically converts a CSV data into an array of records.



    records-from-csv(
      data
    ) -> array


===  Parameters

` data `
The CSV data that needs to be converted, this can be obtained using the native
` csv ` function, like ` records-from-csv(csv(file-path)) ` .

This function simplifies the process of converting CSV data into a format
compatible with ` tabut ` . It reads the CSV data, extracts the headers, and
converts each row into a dictionary, using the headers as keys.

It also automatically converts data into floats or integers when possible.

==  ` rows-to-records `

Converts rows of data into an array of records based on specified headers.

This function is useful for converting data in a ârowsâ format (commonly
found in CSV files) into an array of dictionaries format, which is required
for ` tabut ` and allows easy data processing using the built in array
functions.



    rows-to-records(
      headers,
      rows,
      default: none
    ) -> array


===  Parameters

` headers `
An array representing the headers of the table. Each item in this array
corresponds to a column header.

` rows `
An array of arrays, each representing a row of data. Each sub-array contains
the cell data for a corresponding row.

` default `
(optional, default: ` none ` ) A default value to use when a cell is empty or
there is an error.

==  ` group `

Groups data based on a specified function and returns an array of grouped
records.



    group(
      data,
      function
    ) -> array


===  Parameters

` data `
An array of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a single record or
object.

` function `
A function that takes a record as input and returns a value based on which the
grouping is to be performed.

This function iterates over each record in the ` data ` , applies the `
function ` to determine the grouping value, and organizes the records into
groups based on this value. Each group record is represented as a dictionary
with two properties: ` value ` (the result of the grouping function) and `
group ` (an array of records belonging to this group).

In the context of ` tabut ` , the ` group ` function is particularly useful
for creating summary tables where records need to be categorized and
aggregated based on certain criteria, such as calculating total or average
values for each group.

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` short-title ` : Paper short title (for page header).
  - ` authors ` : An array of author dictionaries. Each of the author dictionaries must have a name key and can have the keys department, organization, location, and email.
  - ` last-names ` : List of authors last names (for page header).
  - ` keywords ` : Publication keywords (used in PDF metadata).
  - ` date ` : Creation date (used in PDF metadata).
  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or none. Appears at the top under the title.
  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the bibliography function or none. The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the paper.
  - ` appendix ` : Content to append after bibliography section.
  - ` pubdata ` : Dictionary with auxiliary information about publication. It contains editor name(s), paper id, volume, and submission/review/publishing dates.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` jmlr `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule at the top of your file.



    #import "@preview/classic-jmlr": jmlr

      title: [Sample JMLR Paper],

==  Issues

This template is developed at [ daskol/typst-templates
](https://github.com/daskol/typst-templates) repo. Please report all issues
there.

  - Original JMLR example paper is not not representative. It does not demonstrate appearance of figures, images, tables, lists, etc.

  - Leading in author affilations in in the original template is varying.

  - There is no bibliography CSL-style. The closest one is ` bristol-university-press ` .

  - Another issue is related to Typstâs inablity to produce colored annotation. In order to mitigte the issue, we add a script which modifies annotations and make them colored.

        ../colorize-annotations.py \
        example-paper.typst.pdf example-paper-colored.typst.pdf


See [ README.md ](https://github.com/daskol/typst-templates/#colored-
annotations) for details.

= *modpattern.md*

=  modpattern

0.1.0

Easily create patterns in typst.

This package provides exactly one function: ` modpattern `

Itâs primary goal is to create make this: ![comparison
table](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/modpattern/0.1.0/examples/comparison.png)

==  modpattern function

The function with the signature ` modpattern(size, body, dx: 0pt, dy: 0pt,
background: none) ` has the following parameters:

  - ` size ` is as size for patterns
  - ` body ` is the inside/body/content of the pattern
  - ` dx ` , ` dy ` allow for translations
  - ` background ` allows any type allowed in the box fill argument. It gets applied first

Notice that, in contrast to typst patterns, size is a positional argument.

Take a look at the example directory, to understand how to use this and to see
the reasoning behind the ` background ` argument.

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` modpattern `

    On peut aussi faire un #text(fill: insa-colors.secondary)[texte] avec les #text(fill: insa-colors.primary)[couleurs de l'INSA] !

    == Une autre slide

    Du texte

    #pause

    Et un autre texte qui apparaÃ®t plus tard !

    #section-slide[Une autre section][Avec une petite description]

    Coucou


==  Usage

===  Slide show rule

You call it with ` #show: insa-slides.with(..parameters) ` .

Parameter  |  Description  |  Type  |  Example
---|---|---|---
*title* |  Title of the presentation  |  content  |  ` [Titre de la prez] `
*title-visual* |  Content shown at the right of the title slide  |  content  |  none
*subtitle* |  Subtitle of the presentation  |  content  |  ` [Sous-titre] `
*insa* |  INSA name ( ` rennes ` , ` hdf ` â¦)  |  str  |  ` "rennes" `

If you assign a content to ` title-visual ` , the title slide will
automatically switch layout to the âvisualâ one from the graphic charter.
If you do not assign a visual content, the title slide will only contain the
title and subtitle and will choose the simple layout.

===  Section slide

A section slide is automatically created when you put a level-1 header in your
markup. For example:



    = Slide section
    Blablabla


Will create a section slide with the title âSlide sectionâ and will be
followed by a content slide containing âBlablablaâ.

If you want to put a subtitle in your section slide, you must explicitely use
the ` section-slide ` function like so:



    #section-slide[Titre de section][Description de section]


==  Fonts

The graphic charter recommends the fonts *League Spartan* for headings and
*Source Serif* for regular text. To have the best look, you should install
those fonts.

> You can download the fonts from [ here ](https://github.com/SkytAsul/INSA-
> Typst-Template/tree/main/fonts) .

To behave correctly on computers lacking those specific fonts, this template
will automatically fallback to similar ones:

  - *League Spartan* -> *Arial* (approved by INSAâs graphic charter, by default in Windows) -> *Liberation Sans* (by default in most Linux)
  - *Source Serif* -> *Source Serif 4* (downloadable for free) -> *Georgia* (approved by the graphic charter) -> *Linux Libertine* (default Typst font)

===  Note on variable fonts

If you want to install those fonts on your computer, Typst might not recognize
them if you install their _Variable_ versions. You should install the static
versions ( *League Spartan Bold* and most versions of *Source Serif* ).

Keep an eye on [ the issue in Typst bug tracker
](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/185) to see when variable fonts will
be used!

==  Notes

This template is being developed by Youenn LE JEUNE from the INSA de Rennes in
[ this repository ](https://github.com/SkytAsul/INSA-Typst-Template) .

For now it includes assets from the graphic charters of those INSAs:

  - Rennes ( ` rennes ` )
  - Hauts de France ( ` hdf ` )
  - Centre Val de Loire ( ` cvl ` ) Users from other INSAs can open a pull request on the repository with the assets for their INSA.

If you have any other feature request, open an issue on the repository.

= *mitex.md*

=  mitex

0.2.4

LaTeX support for Typst, powered by Rust and WASM.

*[ LaTeX ](https://www.latex-project.org/) support for [ Typst
](https://typst.app/) , powered by [ Rust ](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [
WASM ](https://webassembly.org/) . *

[ MiTeX ](https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex) processes LaTeX code into an
abstract syntax tree (AST). Then it transforms the AST into Typst code and
evaluates code into Typst content by ` eval ` function.

MiTeX has been proved to be practical on a large project. It has already
correctly converted 32.5k equations from [ OI Wiki ](https://github.com/OI-
wiki/OI-wiki) . Compared to [ texmath ](https://github.com/jgm/texmath) ,
MiTeX has a better display effect and performance in that wiki project. It is
also more easy to use, since importing MiTeX to Typst is just one line of
code, while texmath is an external program.

In addition, MiTeX is not only *SMALL* but also *FAST* ! MiTeX has a size
of just about 185 KB, comparing that texmath has a size of 17 MB. A not strict
but intuitive comparison is shown below. To convert 32.5k equations from OI
Wiki, texmath takes about 109s, while MiTeX WASM takes only 2.28s and MiTeX
x86 takes merely 0.085s.

Thanks to [ @Myriad-Dreamin ](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin) , he
completed the most complex development work: developing the parser for
generating AST.

==  MiTeX as a Typst Package

  - Use ` mitex-convert ` to convert LaTeX code into Typst code in string.
  - Use ` mi ` to render an inline LaTeX equation in Typst.
  - Use ` mitex(numbering: none, supplement: auto, ..) ` or ` mimath ` to render a block LaTeX equation in Typst.
  - Use ` mitext ` to render a LaTeX text in Typst.

PS: ` #set math.equation(numbering: "(1)") ` is also valid for MiTeX.

Following is [ a simple example ](https://github.com/mitex-
rs/mitex/blob/main/packages/mitex/examples/example.typ) of using MiTeX in
Typst:



    #import "@preview/mitex:0.2.4": *

    #assert.eq(mitex-convert("\alpha x"), "alpha  x ")

    Write inline equations like #mi("x") or #mi[y].

    Also block equations (this case is from #text(blue.lighten(20%), link("https://katex.org/")[katex.org])):

    #mitex(`
      \newcommand{\f}[2]{#1f(#2)}
      \f\relax{x} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
        \f\hat\xi\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
        \,d\xi
    `)

    We also support text mode (in development):

    #mitext(`
      \iftypst
        #set math.equation(numbering: "(1)", supplement: "equation")
      \fi

      \section{Title}

      A \textbf{strong} text, a \emph{emph} text and inline equation $x + y$.

      Also block \eqref{eq:pythagoras}.

      \begin{equation}
        a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \label{eq:pythagoras}
      \end{equation}
    `)


![example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/mitex/0.2.4/examples/example.png)

==  MiTeX as a CLI Tool

===  Installation

Install latest nightly version by ` cargo install --git
https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex mitex-cli ` .

===  Usage



    mitex compile main.tex
    # or (same as above)
    mitex compile main.tex mitex.typ


==  MiTeX as a Web App

===  MiTeX Online Math Converter

We can convert LaTeX equations to Typst equations in web by wasm. [
https://mitex-rs.github.io/mitex/ ](https://mitex-rs.github.io/mitex/)

===  Underleaf

We made a proof of concept online tex editor to show our conversion speed in
text mode. The PoC loads files from a git repository and then runs typst
compile in browser. As you see, each keystroking get response in preview
quickly.

](https://github.com/mitex-
rs/mitex/assets/34951714/0ce77a2c-0a7d-445f-b26d-e139f3038f83)

==  Implemented Features

  - [x] User-defined TeX (macro) commands, such as ` \newcommand{\mysym}{\alpha} ` .
  - [x] LaTeX equations support.
    - [x] Coloring commands ( ` \color{red} text ` , ` \textcolor{red}{text} ` ).
    - [x] Support for various environments, such as aligned, matrix, cases.
  - [x] Basic text mode support, you can use it to write LaTeX drafts.
    - [x] ` \section ` , ` \textbf ` , ` \emph ` .
    - [x] Inline and block math equations.
    - [x] ` \ref ` , ` \eqref ` and ` \label ` .
    - [x] ` itemize ` and ` enumerate ` environments.

==  Features to Implement

  - [ ] Pass command specification to MiTeX plugin dynamically. With that you can define a typst function ` let myop(it) = op(upright(it)) ` and then use it by ` \myop{it} ` .
  - [ ] Package support, which means that you can change set of commands by telling MiTeX to use a list of packages.
  - [ ] Better text mode support, such as figure, algorithm and description environments.

To achieve the latter two goals, we need a well-structured architecture for
the text mode, along with intricate work. Currently, we donât have very
clear ideas yet. If you are willing to contribute by discussing in the issues
or even submitting pull requests, your contribution is highly welcome.

==  Differences between MiTeX and other solutions

MiTeX has different objectives compared to [ texmath
](https://github.com/jgm/texmath) (a.k.a. [ pandoc ](https://pandoc.org/) ):

  - MiTeX focuses on rendering LaTeX content correctly within Typst, leveraging the powerful programming capabilities of WASM and typst to achieve results that are essentially consistent with LaTeX display.
  - texmath aims to be general-purpose converters and generate strings that are more human-readable.

For example, MiTeX transforms ` \frac{1}{2}_3 ` into ` frac(1, 2)_3 ` , while
texmath converts it into ` 1 / 2_3 ` . The latterâs display is not entirely
correct, whereas the former ensures consistency in display.

Another example is that MiTeX transforms ` (\frac{1}{2}) ` into ` \(frac(1,
2)\) ` instead of ` (frac(1, 2)) ` , avoiding the use of automatic Left/Right
to achieve consistency with LaTeX rendering.

*Certainly, the greatest advantage is that you can directly write LaTeX
content in Typst without the need for manual conversion!*

==  Submitting Issues

If you find missing commands or bugs of MiTeX, please feel free to submit an
issue [ here ](https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex/issues) .

==  Contributing to MiTeX

Currently, MiTeX maintains following three parts of code:

  - A TeX parser library written in *Rust* , see [ mitex-lexer ](https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex/tree/main/crates/mitex-lexer) and [ mitex-parser ](https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex/tree/main/crates/mitex-parser) .
  - A TeX to Typst converter library written in *Rust* , see [ mitex ](https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex/tree/main/crates/mitex) .
  - A list of TeX packages and comamnds written in *Typst* , which then used by the typst package, see [ MiTeX Command Specification ](https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex/tree/main/packages/mitex/specs) .

For a translation process, for example, we have:



    \frac{1}{2}

    ===[parser]===> AST ===[converter]===>

    #eval("$frac(1, 2)$", scope: (frac: (num, den) => $(num)/(den)$))


You can use the ` #mitex-convert() ` function to get the Typst Code generated
from LaTeX Code.

===  Add missing TeX commands

Even if you donât know Rust at all, you can still add missing TeX commands
to MiTeX by modifying [ specification files ](https://github.com/mitex-
rs/mitex/tree/main/packages/mitex/specs) , since they are written in typst!
You can open an issue to acquire the commands you want to add, or you can edit
the files and submit a pull request.

In the future, we will provide the ability to customize TeX commands, which
will make it easier for you to use the commands you create for yourself.

===  Develop the parser and the converter

See [ CONTRIBUTING.md ](https://github.com/mitex-
rs/mitex/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) .

= *diagraph.md*

=  diagraph

0.3.0

Draw graphs with Graphviz. Use mathematical formulas as labels.

A simple Graphviz binding for Typst using the WebAssembly plugin system.

==  Usage

===  Basic usage

You can render a Graphviz Dot string to a SVG image using the ` render `
function:



    #render("digraph { a -> b }")


Alternatively, you can use ` raw-render ` to pass a ` raw ` instead of a
string:



    #raw-render(
      ```dot
      digraph {
        a -> b
      }
      ```
    )

0.1.0

Build elegent slide decks with Typst

IPA: /ËlÉªniÉl/

Made up of, or having the characteristic of, lines.

Lineal is a Typst template for generating beautifully clean and configurably
awesome slides.

![Demo slide
deck](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lineal/0.1.0/assets/img/demo.gif)

==  Philosophy

As a long time user of TeX, I have developed and embedded countless LaTeX
applications into personal and corporate environments, e.g. automating
documentation, conference materials, posters, resumes, etc.

However, LaTeX is showing its age. Compiling a some 30-slide presentation, for
instance, takes perhaps a second, and may requires multiple renders to sync
TikZ positioning and cross-document referencing. Typst remediates these issues
in real-time and with better control and confidence in its data modelling.

Hence, Lineal was born. A professional set of slides produced near instantly,
readily equipped with configurable theming and a suite of flexible components.

==  Usage

Lineal is available through Typst Universe. Ensure you have installed Typst
locally or are familiar with the Typst [ web app ](https://typst.app/) or the
[ Tinymist LSP ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-
dreamin.tinymist) extensions for VS Code.

Get started by importing the package and populating your own `
/content/<slug>.typ ` files:



    #import "@preview/lineal:0.1.0": lineal-theme

    #show: lineal-theme.with(
      aspect-ratio: "16-9",
      config-info(
        title: [$bb("L")"ineal"$],
        subtitle: [A Typst slide template],
        author: [Author],
        date: datetime.today(),
        institution: [Institution],
        logo: [Logo],
      ),
    )

    #title-slide()

    #include "content/index.typ"


Marking up content is as you would with any other Typst document, where the
section ( ` = <section-title> ` ) and subsection ( ` == <slide-title> ` )
shorthands generate the new section slides with dynamic outline and new
tracked slides respectively.

==  Contributing

PRs are very welcome. If you think Lineal could be improved in any way or is
missing a feature, please raise a request ð

==  Acknowledgements

A heartfelt thank you to the team behind [ Typst
](https://github.com/typst/typst) , developing a product that not only
preserves the beauty of LaTeXâs typesetting, but improves on its developer
experience in every way, in line with ongoing community feedback.

This is a package for creating presentation slides in [ Typst
](https://typst.app/) . Read the [ book
](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book) to learn all about it and
click [ here ](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/changelog.html)

==  Quickstart

For the bare-bones, do-it-yourself experience, all you need is:



    // Get Polylux from the official package repository
    #import "@preview/polylux:0.3.1": *

    // Make the paper dimensions fit for a presentation and the text larger
    #set page(paper: "presentation-16-9")
    #set text(size: 25pt)

    // Use #polylux-slide to create a slide and style it using your favourite Typst functions
    #polylux-slide[
      #align(horizon + center)[
        = Very minimalist slides

        A lazy author

        July 23, 2023
      ]
    ]

    #polylux-slide[
      == First slide

      Some static text on this slide.
    ]

    #polylux-slide[
      == This slide changes!

      You can always see this.
      // Make use of features like #uncover, #only, and others to create dynamic content
      #uncover(2)[But this appears later!]
    ]


This code produces these PDF pages: ![minimal
example](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/minimal.png)

From there, you can either start creatively adapting the looks to your likings
or you can use one of the provided themes. The simplest one of them is called
` simple ` (what a coincidence!). It is still very unintrusive but gives you
some sensible defaults:



    #import "@preview/polylux:0.3.1": *

    #import themes.simple: *

    #set text(font: "Inria Sans")

    #show: simple-theme.with(
      footer: [Simple slides],
    )

    #title-slide[
      = Keep it simple!
      #v(2em)

      Alpha #footnote[Uni Augsburg] #h(1em)
      Bravo #footnote[Uni Bayreuth] #h(1em)
      Charlie #footnote[Uni Chemnitz] #h(1em)

      July 23
    ]

    #slide[
      == First slide

      #lorem(20)
    ]

    #focus-slide[
      _Focus!_

      This is very important.
    ]

    #centered-slide[
      = Let's start a new section!
    ]

    #slide[
      == Dynamic slide
      Did you know that...

      #pause
      ...you can see the current section at the top of the slide?
    ]


This time, we obtain these PDF pages: ![simple
example](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/themes/gallery/simple.png)

As you can see, a theme can introduce its own types of slides (here: ` title-
slide ` , ` slide ` , ` focus-slide ` , ` centered-slide ` ) to let you
quickly switch between different layouts. The book [ has more infos
](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/themes/themes.html) on how
to use (and create your own) themes.

For dynamic content, Polylux also provides [ a convenient API for complex
overlays
](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/dynamic/dynamic.html) .

If you use [ pdfpc ](https://pdfpc.github.io/) to display your slides, you can
rely on [ Polyluxâ support for it
](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/external/pdfpc.html) and
create speaker notes, hide slides, configure the timer and more!

Visit the [ book ](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book) for more
details or take a look at the [ demo PDF
](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/polylux/releases/latest/download/demo.pdf)
where you can see the features of this template in action.

= *boxr.md*

=  boxr

0.1.0

A modular, and easy to use, package for creating cardboard cutouts in Typst.

Boxr is a modular, and easy to use, package for creating cardboard cutouts in
Typst.

==  Usage

Create a boxr structure in your project with the following code:



    #import "@preview/boxr:0.1.0": *

    #render-structure(
      "box",
      width: 100pt,
      height: 100pt,
      depth: 100pt,
      tab-size: 20pt,
      [
        Hello from boxr!
      ]
    )


The ` render-structure ` function is the main function for boxr. It either
takes a path to one of the default structures provided by boxr (e.g.: ` "box"
` ) or an unpacked json file with your own custom structure (e.g.: ` json(my-
structure.json) ` ). These describe the structure of the cutout.
The other named arguments depend on the structure you are rendering. All
unnamed arguments are passed to the structure as content and will be rendered
on each box face (not triangles or tabs).

==  Creating your own structures

Structures are defined in ` .json ` files. An example structure that just
shows a box with a tab on one face is shown below:



    {
      "variables": ["height", "width", "tab-size"],
      "width": "width",
      "height": "height + tab-size",
      "offset-x": "",
      "offset-y": "tab-size",
      "root": {
        "type": "box",
        "id": 0,
        "width": "width",
        "height": "height",
        "children": {
          "top": "tab(tab-size, tab-size)"
        }
      }
    }


The ` variables ` key is a list of variable names that can be passed to the
structure. These will be required to be passed to the ` render-structure `
function.
The ` width ` and ` height ` keys are evaluated to calculate the width and
height of the structure.
The ` offset-x ` and ` offset-y ` keys are evaluated to place the structure in
the middle of its bounds. It is relative to the root node. In this case for
example, the top tab adds a ` tab-size ` on top of the box as opposed to the
bottom, where there is no tab. So this ` tab-size ` is added to the ` offset-y
` .
` root ` denotes the first node in the structure.
A node can be of the following types:

  - ` box ` :
    - The root node has a ` width ` and a ` height ` . All following nodes have a ` size ` . Child nodes use ` size ` and the parent nodeâs ` width ` and ` height ` to calculate their own width and height.
    - Can have ` children ` nodes.
    - Can have an ` id ` key that is used to place content on the face of the box. The id-th unnamed argument is placed on the face. Multiple faces can have the same id.
    - Can have a ` no-fold ` key. If this exists, no fold stroke will be drawn between this box and its parent.
  - ` triangle-<left|right> ` :
    - Has a ` width ` and ` height ` .
    - ` left ` and ` right ` denote the direction the other right angled line is facing relative to the base.
    - Can have ` children ` nodes.
    - Can have a ` no-fold ` key. If this exists, no fold stroke will be drawn between this triangle and its parent.
  - ` tab ` :
    - Is not a json object, but a string that denotes a tab. The tab is placed on the parent node.
    - Has a tab-size and a cutin-size inside the ` () ` separted by a ` , ` .
  - ` none ` :
    - Is not a json object, but a string that denotes no node. This is useful for deleting a cut-stroke between two nodes.

Every string value in the json file ( ` width: "__", height: "__", ... offset-x/y: "__" ` and the values between the ` | ` for tabs) is evaluated as regular typst code. This means that you can use all named variables passed to the structure. All inputs are converted to points and the result of the evaluation will be converted back to a length.

===  Utility Functions

These could be useful while writing your thesis!



    // A TODO marker. (inline: false -> margin note, inline: true -> box).
    #let todo(inline: false, body)

    // Like \section* in LaTeX. (unnumbered level 2 heading, not in ToC).
    #let section = heading.with(level: 2, outlined: false, numbering: none)

    // A neat inline-section in smallcaps and sans font.
    #let inline-section(title) = smallcaps[*#text(font: "Libertinus Sans", title)*]

    // Fully empty page, no page numbering.
    #let empty-page = page([], footer: [])

    // Subfigures (see chapters/introduction for syntax).
    #let subfigure(..)

    // A ParCIO-like table with a design taken from the LaTeX template.
    #let parcio-table(max-rows, ..args)

    // Nicer handling of (multiple) appendices. Specify `reset: true` with your first appendix to reset the heading counter!
    #let appendix(reset: false, label: none, body)


===  Translations

If you wish, you can provide custom translations for things like
âSectionâ, âContentsâ, etc. by providing a custom ` translations.toml
` (this template already comes with translations for English and German) with
the following schema:



    # Top-level dict name should follow ISO 639 language codes!
    default-lang = "en"

    [de]
    contents = "Inhaltsverzeichnis"
    chapter = "Kapitel"
    section = "Sektion"
    thesis = { value = "Arbeit", compound = true }

    [de.title-page]
    first-reviewer = "Erstgutachter"
    second-reviewer = "Zweitgutachter"
    supervisor = "Betreuer"

    [de.bibliography]
    bibliography = "Quellenverzeichnis"
    cited-on-page = "Zitiert auf Seite"
    cited-on-pages = "Zitiert auf Seiten"
    join = "und"

    [de.date]
    date-format = "[day]. [month repr:long] [year]"
    months = ["Januar", "Februar", "MÃ¤rz", "April", "Mai", "Juni", "Juli", "August", "September", "Oktober", "November", "Dezember"]


==  Fonts and OvGU Corporate Design

This template requires these three fonts to be installed on your system[^1]:

  - Libertinus Serif ( [ https://github.com/alerque/libertinus ](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus) )
  - Libertinus Sans ( [ https://github.com/alerque/libertinus ](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus) )
  - Inconsolata ( [ https://github.com/googlefonts/Inconsolata ](https://github.com/googlefonts/Inconsolata) )

We bundle the default âFaculty of Computer Scienceâ head banner and use it
as the ` header-logo ` . You can find yours at: [
https://www.cd.ovgu.de/FakultÃ¤ten.html
](https://www.cd.ovgu.de/Fakult%C3%A4ten.html) .

[^1]: Typst should already provide the Libertinus font family by default as it
is their standard font.

= *based.md*

=  based

0.2.0

Encoder and decoder for base64, base32, and base16.

A package for encoding and decoding in base64, base32, and base16.

==  Usage

The package comes with three submodules: ` base64 ` , ` base32 ` , and `
base16 ` . All of them have an ` encode ` and ` decode ` function. The package
also provides the function aliases

  - ` encode64 ` / ` decode64 ` ,
  - ` encode32 ` / ` decode32 ` , and
  - ` encode16 ` / ` decode16 ` .

Both base64 and base32 allow you to choose whether to use padding for encoding
via the ` pad ` parameter, which is enabled by default. Base64 also allows you
to encode with the URL-safe alphabet by enabling the ` url ` parameter, while
base32 allows you to encode or decode with the âextended hexâ alphabet via
the ` hex ` parameter. Both options are disabled by default. The base16
encoder uses lowercase letters, the decoder is case-insensitive.

You can encode strings, arrays and bytes. The ` encode ` function will return
a string, while the ` decode ` function will return bytes.

==  Example



    #import "@preview/based:0.2.0": base64, base32, base16

    #table(
      columns: 3,

      table.header[*Base64*][*Base32*][*Base16*],

      raw(base64.encode("Hello world!")),
      raw(base32.encode("Hello world!")),
      raw(base16.encode("Hello world!")),

      str(base64.decode("SGVsbG8gd29ybGQh")),
      str(base32.decode("JBSWY3DPEB3W64TMMQQQ====")),
      str(base16.decode("48656C6C6F20776F726C6421"))
    )

= *blind-cvpr.md*

![A preview of the blind-cvpr Typst
template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/blind-
cvpr-0.5.0-small.webp)

=  blind-cvpr

0.5.0

CVPR-style paper template to publish at the Computer Vision and Pattern
Recognition (CVPR) conferences.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=blind-cvpr&version=0.5.0)

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking _Start from
template_ on the dashboard and searching for ` blind-cvpr ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/blind-cvpr


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` cvpr2022 ` and ` cvpr2025 ` styling rule with the
following named arguments.

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` authors ` : An array of author dictionaries. Each of the author dictionaries must have a name key and can have the keys department, organization, location, and email.
  - ` keywords ` : Publication keywords (used in PDF metadata).
  - ` date ` : Creation date (used in PDF metadata).
  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or none. Appears at the top under the title.
  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the bibliography function or none. The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the paper.
  - ` appendix ` : Content to append after bibliography section.
  - ` accepted ` : If this is set to ` false ` then anonymized ready for submission document is produced; ` accepted: true ` produces camera-redy version. If the argument is set to ` none ` then preprint version is produced (can be uploaded to arXiv).
  - ` id ` : Identifier of a submission.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` cvpr2025
` function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use
this template, you can add a show rule at the top of your file.



    #import "@preview/blind-cvpr:0.5.0": cvpr2025

    #show: cvpr2025.with(
      title: [LaTeX Author Guidelines for CVPR Proceedings],
      authors: (authors, affls),
      keywords: (),
      abstract: [
        The ABSTRACT is to be in fully justified italicized text, at the top of the
        left-hand column, below the author and affiliation information. Use the
        word "Abstract" as the title, in 12-point Times, boldface type, centered
        relative to the column, initially capitalized. The abstract is to be in
        10-point, single-spaced type. Leave two blank lines after the Abstract,
        then begin the main text. Look at previous CVPR abstracts to get a feel for
        style and length.
      ],
      bibliography: bibliography("main.bib"),
      accepted: false,
      id: none,
    )


==  Issues

  - In case of US Letter, column sizes + gap does not equals to text width (2 * 3.25 + 5/16 != 6 + 7/8). It seems that correct gap should be 3/8.

  - At the moment of Typst v0.11.0, it is impossible to indent the first paragraph in a section (see [ typst/typst#311 ](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/311) ). The workaround is to add indentation manually as follows.

        == H2

    #h(12pt)  Manually as space for the first paragraph.
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do.

    // The second one is just fine.
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do.


Also, we add ` indent ` constant as a shortcut for ` h(12pt) ` .

This issue is relevant to CVPR 2022. In the 2025 template there is no
indentaino of the first paragraph in section.

  - At the moment Typst v0.11.0 does not allow flexible customization of citation styles. Specifically, CVPR 2022 citation lookes like ` [42] ` where number is colored hyperlink. In order to achive this, we shouuld provide custom CSL-style and then colorize number and put it into square parenthesis in typst markup.

  - CVPR 2022 requires simple ruler which enumerates lines in regular intervals whilst CVPR2025 already requires a ruler which add line numers per line in paragraph or heading. Thus we need the next major Typst release v0.12.0 for ruler. With the next Typst release, we can do the following.

        set par.line(numbering: "1")
    show figure: set par.line(numbering: none)


For implementation details see [ typst/typst#4516
](https://github.com/typst/typst/pull/4516) .

  - CVPR 2022 and 2025 requires IEEE-like bibliography style but does not follow its guidelines closely. Since writing CSL-style files is tedious task, we adopt close enough bibliography style from Zotero.

= *i-figured.md*

=  i-figured

0.2.4

Configurable figure and equation numbering per section.

Configurable figure numbering per section.

==  Examples

===  Basic

Have a look at the source [ here
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/i-figured/0.2.4/examples/basic.typ)
.

![Example:
basic](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/i-figured/0.2.4/examples/basic.png)

===  Two levels deep

Have a look at the source [ here
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/i-figured/0.2.4/examples/level-
two.typ) .

![Example: two levels
deep](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/i-figured/0.2.4/examples/level-
two.png)

==  Usage

The package mainly consists of two customizable show rules, which set up all
the numbering. There is also an additional function to make showing an outline
of figures easier.

Because the [ ` show-figure() `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/i-figured/0.2.4/#show-
figure) function must internally create another figure element, attached
labels cannot directly be used for references. To circumvent this, a new label
is attached to the internal figure, with the same name but prefixed with `
fig: ` , ` tbl: ` , or ` lst: ` for images (and all other types of generic
figures), tables, and raw code figures (aka listings) respectively. These new
labels can be used for referencing without problems.



    // import the package
    #import "@preview/i-figured:0.2.4"

    // make sure you have some heading numbering set
    #set heading(numbering: "1.")

    // apply the show rules (these can be customized)
    #show heading: i-figured.reset-counters
    #show figure: i-figured.show-figure

    // show an outline
    #i-figured.outline()

    = Hello World

    #figure([hi], caption: [Bye World.]) <bye>

    // when referencing, the label names must be prefixed with `fig:`, `tbl:`,
    // or `lst:` depending on the figure kind.
    @fig:bye displays the text "hi".


==  Reference

===  ` reset-counters `

Reset all figure counters. To be used in a heading show rule like ` #show
heading: i-figured.reset-counters ` .



    #let reset-counters(
      it,
      level: 1,
      extra-kinds: (),
      equations: true,
      return-orig-heading: true,
    ) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` it ` : [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The heading element from the show rule.
  - ` level ` : [ ` int ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/int/) â At which heading level to reset the counters. A value of ` 2 ` will cause the counters to be reset at level two _and_ level one headings.
  - ` extra-kinds ` : [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) of ( [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or [ ` function ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/) ) â Additional custom figure kinds. If you have any figures with a ` kind ` other than ` image ` , ` table ` , or ` raw ` , you must add the ` kind ` here for its counter to be reset.
  - ` equations ` : [ ` bool ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) â Whether the counter for math equations should be reset.
  - ` return-orig-heading ` : [ ` bool ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) â Whether the original heading element should be included in the returned content. Set this to false if you manually want to construct a heading instead of using the default.

*Returns:* [ ` content `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The unmodified
heading.

===  ` show-figure `

Show a figure with per-section numbering. To be used in a figure show rule
like ` #show figure: i-figured.show-figure ` .



    #let show-figure(
      it,
      level: 1,
      zero-fill: true,
      leading-zero: true,
      numbering: "1.1",
      extra-prefixes: (:),
      fallback-prefix: "fig:",
    ) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` it ` : [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The figure element from the show rule.
  - ` level ` : [ ` int ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/int/) â How many levels of the current heading counter should be added in front. Note that you can control this individually from the ` level ` parameter on [ ` reset-counters() ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/i-figured/0.2.4/#reset-counters) .
  - ` zero-fill ` : [ ` bool ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) â If ` true ` and assuming a ` level ` of ` 2 ` , a figure after a ` 1. ` heading but before a ` 1.1. ` heading will show ` 1.0.1 ` as numbering, else the middle zero is excluded. Note that if set to ` false ` , not all figure numberings are guaranteed to have the same length.
  - ` leading-zero ` : [ ` bool ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) â Whether figures before the first top-level heading should have a leading ` 0 ` . Note that if set to ` false ` , not all figure numberings are guaranteed to have the same length.
  - ` numbering ` : [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or [ ` function ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/) â The actual numbering pattern to use for the figures.
  - ` extra-prefixes ` : [ ` dictionary ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/) of [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) to [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) pairs â Additional label prefixes. This can optionally be used to specify prefixes for custom figure kinds, otherwise they will also use the fallback prefix.
  - ` fallback-prefix ` : [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) â The label prefix to use for figure kinds which donât have another prefix set.

*Returns:* [ ` content `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The modified
figure.

===  ` show-equation `

Show a math equation with per-section numbering. To be used in a show rule
like ` #show math.equation: i-figured.show-equation ` .



    #let show-equation(
      it,
      level: 1,
      zero-fill: true,
      leading-zero: true,
      numbering: "(1.1)",
      prefix: "eqt:",
      only-labeled: false,
      unnumbered-label: "-",
    ) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

For the arguments ` level ` , ` zero-fill ` , ` leading-zero ` , and `
numbering ` refer to [ ` show-figure() `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/i-figured/0.2.4/#show-
figure) .

  - ` it ` : [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The equation element from the show rule.
  - ` prefix ` : [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) â The label prefix to use for all equations.
  - ` only-labeled ` : [ ` bool ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) â Whether only equations with labels should be numbered.
  - ` unnumbered-label ` : [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) â A label to explicitly disable numbering for an equation.

*Returns:* [ ` content `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The modified
equation.

===  ` outline `

Show the outline for a kind of figure. This is just the same as calling `
outline(target: figure.where(kind: i-figured._prefix + repr(target-kind)), ..)
` , the function just exists for convenience and clarity.



    #let outline(target-kind: image, title: [List of Figures], ..args) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` target-kind ` : [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or [ ` function ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/) â Which kind of figure to list.
  - ` title ` : [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) or ` none ` â The title of the outline.
  - ` ..args ` â Other arguments to pass to the underlying [ ` outline() ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/) call.

*Returns:* [ ` content `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The outline
element.

0.1.0

Serialization module for Typst

serialize the Typst objects into bytes and deserialize the bytes into Typst
objects

==  Reason

I want to interactive between the wasm and typst. But I found that the input
arguments and output argument are all bytes. It is not convenient for me to
use WASM. So I designed the serialization protocol and implemented this
serialization module for reference.

Although there have been some serialization APIs like cbor, yaml, json and
others, this is a good learning material and a good example to show the
abilities of Typst.

==  Example

Have a look at the example [ here
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/yats/0.1.0/example.typ)
.

==  Usage

Simply import 2 functions : ` serialize ` , ` deserialize ` .

And enjoy it



    #import "@preview/yats:0.1.0": serialize, deserialize
    #{
      let obj = (
        name : "0warning0error",
        age : 100,
        height : 1.8,
        birthday : datetime(year : 1998,month : 7,day:8)
      )
      deserialize(serialize(obj))
    }


==  Supported Types

  - ` none `
  - ` bool `
  - ` type ` : type is a type
  - ` int `
  - ` float ` : (implemented in string, for convenience)
  - ` datetime ` : only support ` year ` , ` month ` , ` day ` ; ` hour ` , ` minute ` , ` second ` ; both combined.
  - ` duration `
  - ` bytes `
  - ` string `
  - ` regex ` : (dealing with it is a little tricky)
  - ` array ` : the element in it can be anything listed.
  - ` dictionary ` : the value in it can be anything listed.

==  ` Yats ` function



    #let serialize(
      data : any
    ) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` data ` : [ ` any ` ] â Any supported object .

*Return*

The serialized bytes.



    #let deserialize(
      data : array
    ) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` data ` : [ ` bytes ` ] â serialized objects represented by bytes .

*Return*

binary array. (the first one is the object deserialized, the second one is the
valid length of the bytes)

==  Potential Problems and limitation

  - Some problem can be caused by changes of ` repr ` . For example, the serialization of ` regex ` relies on the ` repr ` of ` regex ` . And there are no method to directly catch the inner ` string ` .

  - Because of lack of time, only basic types are supported. But more types can be supported in Typst.

0.3.1

Convert Chinese text between Traditional/Simplified and regional variants.
ä¸­æç®ç¹åå°åè©è½æ

zhconv-typst converts Chinese text between Traditional, Simplified and
regional variants in typst, utilizing [ zhconv-rs
](https://github.com/Gowee/zhconv-rs) .

==  Usage

To use the ` zhconv ` plugin in your Typst project, import it as follows:



    #import "@preview/zhconv:0.3.1": zhconv


===  Text Conversion

The primary function provided by this package is ` zhconv ` , which converts
strings or nested contents to a target Chinese variant.



    #zhconv(content, "target-variant", wikitext: false)


  - ` content ` : The text or content to be converted.
  - ` target-variant ` : The target Chinese variant (e.g., ` "zh-hant" ` , ` "zh-hans" ` , ` "zh-cn" ` , ` "zh-tw" ` , ` "zh-hk" ` ).
  - ` wikitext ` : An optional boolean flag to specify if the text should be processed as wikitext (default is ` false ` ).

====  Example

=====  Convert a string



    #let text = "äºèç½"
    Original: #text
    - #emph([zh-HK]): #zhconv(text, "zh-hk")
    - #emph([zh-TW]): #zhconv(text, "zh-tw")

0.5.3

Hand Picked Index for Typst.

Automatically create a handcrafted index in [ typst ](https://typst.app/) .
This typst component allows the automatic creation of an Index page with
entries that have been manually marked in the document by its authors. This,
in times of advanced search functionality, seems somewhat outdated, but a
handcrafted index like this allows the authors to point the reader to just the
right location in the document.

â ï¸ Typst is in beta and evolving, and this package evolves with it. As a
result, no backward compatibility is guaranteed yet. Also, the package itself
is under development and fine-tuning.

    - [ v0.0.2 ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/in-dexter/0.5.3/#v002)

==  Usage

==  Importing the Component

To use the index functionality, the component must be available. This can be
achieved by importing the package ` in-dexter ` into the project:

Add the following code to the head of the document file(s) that want to use
the index:



      #import "@preview/in-dexter:0.5.3": *


Alternatively it can be loaded from the file, if you have it copied into your
project.



      #import "in-dexter.typ": *


==  Remarks for new version

In previous versions (before 0.0.6) of in-dexter, it was required to hide the
index entries with a show rule. This is not required anymore.

==  Marking Entries

To mark a word to be included in the index, a simple function can be used. In
the following sample code, the word âelitâ is marked to be included into
the index.



    = Sample Text
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing #index[elit], sed do eiusmod tempor
    incididunt ut labore et dolore.


Nested entries can be created - the following would create an entry `
adipiscing ` with sub entry ` elit ` .



    = Sample Text
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit#index("adipiscing", "elit"), sed do eiusmod
    tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore.


The marking, by default, is invisible in the resulting text, while the marked
word will still be visible. With the marking in place, the index component
knows about the word, as well as its location in the document.

==  Generating the Index Page

The index page can be generated by the following function:



    = Index
    #columns(3)[
      #make-index(title: none)
    ]


This sample uses the optional title, outline, and use-page-counter parameters:



    #make-index(title: [Index], outlined: true, use-page-counter: true)


The ` make-index() ` function takes three optional arguments: ` title ` , `
outlined ` , and ` use-page-counter ` .

  - ` title ` adds a title (with ` heading ` ) and
  - ` outlined ` is ` false ` by default and is passed to the heading function
  - ` use-page-counter ` is ` false ` by default. If set to ` true ` it will use ` counter(page).display() ` for the page number text in the index instead of the absolute page position (the absolute position is still used for the actual link target)

If no title is given the heading should never appear in the layout. Note: The
heading is (currently) not numbered.

The first sample emits the index in three columns. Note: The actual appearance
depends on your template or other settings of your document.

You can find a preview image of the resulting page on [ in-dexterÂ´s GitHub
repository ](https://github.com/RolfBremer/in-dexter) .

You may have noticed that some page numbers are displayed as bold. These are
index entries which are marked as âmainâ entries. Such entries are meant
to be the most important for the given entry. They can be marked as follows:



    #index(fmt: strong, [Willkommen])


or you can use the predefined semantically helper function



    #index-main[Willkommen]


===  Brief Sample Document

This is a very brief sample to demonstrate how in-dexter can be used. The next
chapter contains a more fleshed out sample.



    #import "@preview/in-dexter:0.5.3": *


    = My Sample Document with `in-dexter`

    In this document the usage of the `in-dexter` package is demonstrated to create
    a hand picked #index[Hand Picked] index. This sample #index-main[Sample]
    document #index[Document] is quite short, and so is its index.


    = Index

    This section contains the generated Index.

    #make-index()


===  Full Sample Document



    #import "@preview/in-dexter:0.5.3": *

    #let index-main(..args) = index(fmt: strong, ..args)

    // Document settings
    #set page("a5")
    #set text(font: ("Arial", "Trebuchet MS"), size: 12pt)


    = My Sample Document with `in-dexter`

    In this document #index[Document] the usage of the `in-dexter` package #index[Package]
    is demonstrated to create a hand picked index #index-main[Index]. This sample document
    is quite short, and so is its index. So to fill this sample with some real text,
    letÂ´s elaborate on some aspects of a hand picked #index[Hand Picked] index. So, "hand
    picked" means, the entries #index[Entries] in the index are carefully chosen by the
    author(s) of the document to point the reader, who is interested in a specific topic
    within the documents domain #index[Domain], to the right spot #index[Spot]. Thats, how
    it should be; and it is quite different to what is done in this sample text, where the
    objective #index-main[Objective] was to put many different index markers
    #index[Markers] into a small text, because a sample should be as brief as possible,
    while providing enough substance #index[Substance] to demo the subject
    #index[Subject]. The resulting index in this demo is somewhat pointless
    #index[Pointless], because all entries are pointing to few different pages
    #index[Pages], due to the fact that the demo text only has few pages #index[Page].
    That is also the reason for what we chose the DIN A5 #index[DIN A5] format, and we
    also continue with some remarks #index[Remarks] on the next page.


    == Some more demo content without deeper meaning

    #lorem(50) #index[Lorem]

    #pagebreak()

    == Remarks

    Here are some more remarks #index-main[Remarks] to have some content on a second page, what
    is a precondition #index[Precondition] to demo that Index #index[Index] entries
    #index[Entries] may point to multiple pages.


    = Index

    This section #index[Section] contains the generated Index #index[Index], in a nice
    two-column-layout.

    #set text(size: 10pt)
    #columns(2)[
        #make-index()
    ]


The following image shows a generated index page of another document, with
additional formatting for headers applied.

  - Add a sample for raw display.

===  v0.5.2

  - Fix a bug with bang notation.
  - Add compiler to toml file.

===  v0.5.1

  - Migrate deprecated locate to context.

===  v0.5.0

  - Support page numbering formats (i.e. roman), when ` use-page-counter ` is set to true. Thanks to @ThePuzzlemaker!

===  v0.4.3

  - Suppress extra space character emitted by the ` index() ` function.
  - Fix a bug where math formulas are not displayed.
  - Introduce ` apply-casing ` parameter to ` index() ` to suppress entry-casing for individual entries.

===  v0.4.2

  - Improve internal method ` as-text ` to be more robust.
  - tidy up sample-usage.typ.

===  v0.4.1

  - Bug fixed: Fix a bug where an index entry with same name as a group hides the group.
  - Fixed typos in the sample-usage document.

===  v0.4.0

  - Support for a ` display ` parameter for entries. This allows the usage of complex content, like math expressions in the index. (based on suggestions by @lukasjuhrich)
  - Also support a tuple value for display and key parameters of the entry.
  - Improve internal robustness and fix some errors in the sample document.

===  v0.3.2

  - Fix initial parsing and returning fist letter (thanks to @lukasjuhrich, #14)

===  v0.3.1

  - Fix handling of trailing or multiple spaces and crlf in index entries.

===  v0.3.0

  - Support multiple named indexes. Also allow the generation of combined index pages.
  - Support for LaTeX index group syntax ( ` #index("Group1!Group2@Entry" ` ).
  - Support for advanced case handling for the entries in the index. Note: The new default ist to ignore the casing for the sorting of the entries. The behavior can be changed by providing a ` sort-order() ` function to the ` make-index ` function.
  - The casing for the index entry can also be altered by providing a ` entry-casing() ` function to the ` make-index ` function. So it is possible that all entries have an uppercase first letter (which is also the new default!).

===  v0.2.0

  - Allow index to respect unnumbered physical pages at the start of the document (Thanks to @jewelpit). See âSkipping physical pagesâ in the sample-usage document.

===  v0.1.0

  - Implemented:
    - nested entries.
    - custom initials + custom sorting.

===  v0.0.6

  - Change internal index marker to use metadata instead of figures. This allows a cleaner implementation and does not require a show rule to hide the marker-figure anymore.
  - This version requires Typst 0.8.0 due to the use of metadata().
  - Consolidated the ` PackageReadme.md ` into a single ` README.md ` .

===  v0.0.5

  - Address change in ` figure.caption ` in typst (commit: 976abdf ).

===  v0.0.4

![A preview of the bloated-neurips Typst
template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/bloated-
neurips-0.5.1-small.webp)

=  bloated-neurips

0.5.1

NeurIPS-style paper template to publish at the Conference and Workshop on
Neural Information Processing Systems

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=bloated-neurips&version=0.5.1)

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking _Start from
template_ on the dashboard and searching for ` bloated-neurips ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/bloated-neurips


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` neurips2023 ` and ` neurips2024 ` function with
the following named arguments.

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` authors ` : An array of author dictionaries. Each of the author dictionaries must have a name key and can have the keys department, organization, location, and email.
  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or none. Appears at the top under the title.
  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the bibliography function or none. The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the paper.
  - ` appendix ` : A content which is placed after bibliography.
  - ` accepted ` : If this is set to ` false ` then anonymized ready for submission document is produced; ` accepted: true ` produces camera-redy version. If the argument is set to ` none ` then preprint version is produced (can be uploaded to arXiv).

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the `
neurips2024 ` function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing
project to use this template, you can add a show rule at the top of your file
as follows.



    #import "@preview/bloated-neurips:0.5.1": neurips2024

    #show: neurips2024.with(
      title: [Formatting Instructions For NeurIPS 2024],
      authors: (authors, affls),
      keywords: ("Machine Learning", "NeurIPS"),
      abstract: [
        The abstract paragraph should be indented Â½ inch (3 picas) on both the
        left- and right-hand margins. Use 10 point type, with a vertical spacing
        (leading) of 11 points. The word *Abstract* must be centered, bold, and in
        point size 12. Two line spaces precede the abstract. The abstract must be
        limited to one paragraph.
      ],
      bibliography: bibliography("main.bib"),
      appendix: [
        #include "appendix.typ"
        #include "checklist.typ"
      ],
      accepted: false,
    )

    #lorem(42)


With template of version v0.5.1 or newer, one can override some parts.
Specifically, ` get-notice ` entry of ` aux ` directory parameter of show rule
allows to adjust the NeurIPS 2024 template to Science4DL workshop as follows.



    #import "@preview/bloated-neurips:0.5.1": neurips

    #let get-notice(accepted) = if accepted == none {
      return [Preprint. Under review.]
    } else if accepted {
      return [
        Workshop on Scientific Methods for Understanding Deep Learning, NeurIPS
        2024.
      ]
    } else {
      return [
        Submitted to Workshop on Scientific Methods for Understanding Deep
        Learning, NeurIPS 2024.
      ]
    }

    #let science4dl2024(
      title: [], authors: (), keywords: (), date: auto, abstract: none,
      bibliography: none, appendix: none, accepted: false, body,
    ) = {
      show: neurips.with(
        title: title,
        authors: authors,
        keywords: keywords,
        date: date,
        abstract: abstract,
        accepted: false,
        aux: (get-notice: get-notice),
      )
      body
    }


==  Issues

  - The biggest and the most important issues is related to line ruler. We are not aware of universal method for numbering lines in the main body of a paper. Fortunately, line numbering support has been implemented at [ typst/typst#4516 ](https://github.com/typst/typst/pull/4516) . Letâs wait for the next major release v0.12.0!

  - There is an issue in Typst with spacing between figures and between figure with floating placement. The issue is that there is no way to specify gap between subsequent figures. In order to have behaviour similar to original LaTeX template, one should consider direct spacing adjacemnt with ` v(-1em) ` as follows.

        #figure(
      rect(width: 4.25cm, height: 4.25cm, stroke: 0.4pt),
      caption: [Sample figure caption.#v(-1em)],
      placement: top,
    )
    #figure(
      rect(width: 4.25cm, height: 4.25cm, stroke: 0.4pt),
      caption: [Sample figure caption.],
      placement: top,
    )


  - Another issue is related to Typstâs inablity to produce colored annotation. In order to mitigte the issue, we add a script which modifies annotations and make them colored.

        ../colorize-annotations.py \
        example-paper.typst.pdf example-paper-colored.typst.pdf


See [ README.md ](https://github.com/daskol/typst-templates/#colored-
annotations) for details.

  - NeurIPS 2023/2024 instructions discuss bibliography in vague terms. Namely, there is not specific requirements. Thus we stick to ` ieee ` bibliography style since we found it in several accepted papers and it is similar to that in the example paper.

  - It is unclear how to render notice in the bottom of the title page in case of final ( ` accepted: true ` ) or preprint ( ` accepted: none ` ) submission.

    #import "@preview/ttt-utils:0.1.0": components


then you can access the modules function with:

` #components.lines(4) ` or ` #components.caro(5) ` , â¦

or import the wanted functions:



    #import "@preview/ttt-utils:0.1.0": components, assignments

    #import assignments: assignment, question, answer
    #import components: caro as grid_pattern

    // Add a question.

    #assignment[First assignment

        #question[
            #answer(field: grid_pattern(5))
        ]
    ]

= *pyrunner.md*

=  pyrunner

0.2.0

Run python code in typst.

Run python code in [ typst ](https://typst.app/) using [ RustPython
](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython) .



    #import "@preview/pyrunner:0.1.0" as py

    #let compiled = py.compile(
    ```python
    def find_emails(string):
        import re
        return re.findall(r"\b[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}\b", string)

    def sum_all(*array):
        return sum(array)
    ```)

    #let txt = "My email address is john.doe@example.com and my friend's email address is jane.doe@example.net."

    #py.call(compiled, "find_emails", txt)
    #py.call(compiled, "sum_all", 1, 2, 3)


Block mode is also available.



    #let code = ```
    f'{a+b=}'
    ```

    #py.block(code, globals: (a: 1, b: 2))

    #py.block(code, globals: (a: "1", b: "2"))


The result will be ` a+b=3 ` and ` a+b='12' ` .

==  Current limitations

Due to restrictions of typst and its plugin system, some Python function will
not work as expected:

  - File and network IO will always raise an exception.
  - ` datatime.now ` will always return 1970-01-01.

Also, there is no way to import third-party modules. Only bundled stdlib
modules are available. We might find a way to lift this restriction, so feel
free to submit an issue if you want this functionality.

= *diverential.md*

=  diverential

0.2.0

Format differentials conveniently.

` diverential ` is a [ Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) package
simplifying the typesetting of differentials. It is the equivalent to
LaTeXâs ` diffcoeff ` , though not as mature.

==  Overview

` diverential ` allows normal, partial, compact, and separated derivatives
with smart degree calculations.



    #import "@preview/diverential:0.2.0": *

    $ dv(f, x, deg: 2, eval: 0) $
    $ dvp(f, x, y, eval: 0, evalsym: "[") $
    $ dvpc(f, x) $
    $ dvps(f, #([x], 2), #([y], [n]), #([z], [m]), eval: 0) $


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/diverential/0.2.0/examples/overview.jpg)

==  ` dv `

` dv ` is an ordinary derivative. It takes the function as its first argument and the variable as its second one. A degree can be specified with ` deg ` . The derivate can be specified to be evaluated at a point with ` eval ` , the brackets of which can be changed with ` evalsym ` . ` space ` influences the space between derivative and evaluation bracket. Unless defined otherwise, no space is set by default, except for ` | ` , where a small gap is introduced.

===  ` dvs `

Same as ` dv ` , but separates the function from the derivative.
Example: $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} f $$

===  ` dvc `

Same as ` dv ` , but uses a compact derivative.
Example: $$ \mathrm{d}_x f $$

==  ` dvp `

` dv ` is a partial derivative. It takes the function as its first argument
and the variable as the rest. For information on ` eval ` , ` evalsym ` , and
` space ` , read the description of ` dv ` .
The variable can be one of these options:

  - plain variable, e.g. ` x `
  - list of variables, e.g. ` x, y `
  - list of variables with higher degrees (type ` (content, integer) ` ), e.g. ` x, #([y], 2) ` The degree is smartly calculated: If all degrees of the variables are integers, the total degree is their sum. If some are content, the integer ones are summed (arithmetically) up and added to the visual sum of the content degrees. Example: ` #([x], n), #([y], 2), z ` â $\frac{\partial^{n+3}}{\partial x^n,\partial y^2,\partial z}$
Specifying ` deg ` manually is always possible and might be required in more
complicated cases.

===  ` dvps `

Same as ` dvp ` , but separates the function from the derivative.
Example: $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} f $$

===  ` dvpc `

Same as ` dvp ` , but uses a compact derivative.
Note: If supplying multiple variables, ` deg ` is ignored.
Example: $$ \partial_x f $$

= *subpar.md*

=  subpar

0.2.0

Create sub figures easily.

Subpar is a [ Typst ](https://typst.app/) package for creating sub figures.



    #import "@preview/subpar:0.2.0"

    #set page(height: auto)
    #set par(justify: true)

    #subpar.grid(
      figure(image("/assets/andromeda.jpg"), caption: [

= *t4t.md*

=  t4t

0.3.2

A utility package for typst package authors

> A utility package for typst package authors.

*Tools for Typst* ( ` t4t ` in short) is a utility package for [ Typst
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/t4t/0.3.2/typst/typst)
package and template authors. It provides solutions to some recurring tasks in
package development.

The package can be imported or any useful parts of it copied into a project.
It is perfectly fine to treat ` t4t ` as a snippet collection and to pick and
choose only some useful functions. For this reason, most functions are
implemented without further dependencies.

Hopefully, this collection will grow over time with _Typst_ to provide
solutions for common problems.

==  Usage

Either import the package from the Typst preview repository:



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": *


If only a few functions from ` t4t ` are needed, simply copy the necessary
code to the beginning of the document.

==  Reference

- * *

*Note:* This reference might be out of date. Please refer to the manual for
a complete overview of all functions.

- * *

The functions are categorized into different submodules that can be imported
separately.

The modules are:

  - ` is `
  - ` def `
  - ` assert `
  - ` alias `
  - ` math `
  - ` get `

Any or all modules can be imported the usual way:



    // Import as "t4t"
    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2"
    // Import all modules
    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": *
    // Import specific modules
    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": is, def


In general, the main value is passed last to the utility functions. ` #def.if-
none() ` , for example, takes the default value first and the value to test
second. This is somewhat counterintuitive at first, but allows the use of `
.with() ` to generate derivative functions:



    #let is-foo = eq.with("foo")


===  Test functions



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": is


These functions provide shortcuts to common tests like ` #is.eq() ` . Some of
these are not shorter as writing pure Typst code (e.g. ` a == b ` ), but can
easily be used in ` .any() ` or ` .find() ` calls:



    // check all values for none
    if some-array.any(is-none) {
    	...
    }

    // find first not none value
    let x = (none, none, 5, none).find(is.not-none)

    // find position of a value
    let pos-bar = args.pos().position(is.eq.with("|"))


There are two exceptions: ` is-none ` and ` is-auto ` . Since keywords canât
be used as function names, the ` is ` module canât define a function to do `
is.none() ` . Therefore the methods ` is-none ` and ` is-auto ` are provided
in the base module of ` t4t ` :



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": is-none, is-auto


The ` is ` submodule still has these tests, but under different names ( ` is.n
` and ` is.non ` for ` none ` and ` is.a ` and ` is.aut ` for ` auto ` ).

  - ` #is.neq( test ) ` : Creates a new test function that is ` true ` when ` test ` is ` false ` . Can be used to create negations of tests like ` #let not-raw = is.neg(is.raw) ` .

  - ` #is.eq( a, b ) ` : Tests if values ` a ` and ` b ` are equal.

  - ` #is.neq( a, b ) ` : Tests if values ` a ` and ` b ` are not equal.

  - ` #is.n( ..values ) ` : Tests if any of the passed ` values ` is ` none ` .

  - ` #is.non( ..values ) ` : Alias for ` is.n ` .

  - ` #is.not-none( ..values ) ` : Tests if all of the passed ` values ` are not ` none ` .

  - ` #is.not-n( ..values ) ` : Alias for ` is.not-none ` .

  - ` #is.label( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is of type ` label ` .

===  Default values



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": def


These functions perform a test to decide if a given ` value ` is _invalid_ .
If the test _passes_ , the ` default ` is returned, the ` value ` otherwise.

Almost all functions support an optional ` do ` argument, to be set to a
function of one argument, that will be applied to the value if the test fails.
For example:



    // Sets date to a datetime from an optional
    // string argument in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"
    #let date = def.if-none(
    	datetime.today(), 	// default
    	passed_date, 		// passed-in argument
    	do: (d) >= {		// post-processor
    		d = d.split("-")
    		datetime(year=d[0], month=d[1], day=d[2])
    	}
    )


  - ` #def.if-true( test, default, do:none, value ) ` : Returns ` default ` if ` test ` is ` true ` , ` value ` otherwise.
  - ` #def.if-false( test, default, do:none, value ) ` : Returns ` default ` if ` test ` is ` false ` , ` value ` otherwise.
  - ` #def.if-none( default, do:none, value ) ` : Returns ` default ` if ` value ` is ` none ` , ` value ` otherwise.
  - ` #def.if-auto( default, do:none, value ) ` : Returns ` default ` if ` value ` is ` auto ` , ` value ` otherwise.
  - ` #def.if-any( ..compare, default, do:none, value ) ` : Returns ` default ` if ` value ` is equal to any of the passed-in values, ` value ` otherwise. ( ` #def.if-any(none, auto, 1pt, width) ` )
  - ` #def.if-not-any( ..compare, default, do:none, value ) ` : Returns ` default ` if ` value ` is not equal to any of the passed-in values, ` value ` otherwise. ( ` #def.if-not-any(left, right, top, bottom, position) ` )
  - ` #def.if-empty( default, do:none, value ) ` : Returns ` default ` if ` value ` is _empty_ , ` value ` otherwise.
  - ` #def.as-arr( ..values ) ` : Always returns an array containing all ` values ` . Any arrays in ` values ` will be flattened into the result. This is useful for arguments, that can have one element or an array of elements: ` #def.as-arr(author).join(", ") ` .

===  Assertions



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": assert


This submodule overloads the default ` assert ` function and provides more
asserts to quickly check if given values are valid. All functions use ` assert
` in the background.

Since a module in Typst is not callable, the ` assert ` function is now
available as ` assert.that() ` . ` assert.eq ` and ` assert.ne ` work as
expected.

All assert functions take an optional argument ` message ` to set the error
message shown if the assert fails.

  - ` #assert.that( test ) ` : Asserts that the passed ` test ` is ` true ` .

  - ` #assert.that-not( test ) ` : Asserts that the passed ` test ` is ` false ` .

  - ` #assert.eq( a, b ) ` : Asserts that ` a ` is equal to ` b ` .

  - ` #assert.ne( a, b ) ` : Asserts that ` a ` is not equal to ` b ` .

  - ` #assert.neq( a, b ) ` : Alias for ` assert.ne ` .

  - ` #assert.not-none( value ) ` : Asserts that ` value ` is not equal to ` none ` .

  - ` #assert.any( ..values, value ) ` : Asserts that ` value ` is one of the passed ` values ` .

  - ` #assert.not-any( ..values, value ) ` : Asserts that ` value ` is not one of the passed ` values ` .

  - ` #assert.any-type( ..types, value ) ` : Asserts that the type of ` value ` is one of the passed ` types ` .

  - ` #assert.not-any-type( ..types, value ) ` : Asserts that the type of ` value ` is not one of the passed ` types ` .

  - ` #assert.all-of-type( t, ..values ) ` : Asserts that the type of all passed ` values ` is equal to ` t ` .

  - ` #assert.none-of-type( t, ..values ) ` : Asserts that the type of all passed ` values ` is not equal to ` t ` .

  - ` #assert.not-empty( value ) ` : Asserts that ` value ` is not _empty_ .

  - ` #assert.new( test ) ` : Creates a new assert function that uses the passed ` test ` . ` test ` is a function with signature ` (any) => boolean ` . This is a quick way to create an assertion from any of the ` is ` functions:

        #let assert-foo = assert.new(is.eq.with("foo"))

    #let assert-length = assert.new(is.length)


==  Element helpers



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": get


This submodule is a collection of functions, that mostly deal with content
elements and _get_ some information from them. Though some handle other types
like dictionaries.

  - ` #get.dict( ..values ) ` : Create a new dictionary from the passed ` values ` . All named arguments are stored in the new dictionary as is. All positional arguments are grouped in key-value pairs and inserted into the dictionary:

        #get.dict("a", 1, "b", 2, "c", d:4, e:5)

    // (a:1, b:2, c:none, d:4, e:5)


  - ` #get.dict-merge( ..dicts ) ` : Recursively merges the passed-in dictionaries:

        #get.dict-merge(
    	(a: 1),
    	(a: (one: 1, two:2)),
    	(a: (two: 4, three:3))
    )

    // (a:(one:1, two:4, three:3))


  - ` #get.args( args, prefix: "" ) ` : Creates a function to extract values from an argument sink ` args ` .

The resulting function takes any number of positional and named arguments and
creates a dictionary with values from ` args.named() ` . Positional arguments
are present in the result if they are present in ` args.named() ` . Named
arguments are always present, either with their value from ` args.named() ` or
with the provided value.

A ` prefix ` can be specified, to extract only specific arguments. The
resulting dictionary will have all keys with the prefix removed, though.


        #let my-func( ..options, title ) = block(
    	..get.args(options)(
    		"spacing", "above", "below",
    		width:100%
    	)
    )[
    	#text(..get.args(options, prefix:"text-")(
    		fill:black, size:0.8em
    	), title)
    ]

    #my-func(
    	width: 50%,
    	text-fill: red, text-size: 1.2em
    )[#lorem(5)]


  - ` #get.text( element, sep: "" ) ` : Recursively extracts the text content of a content element. If present, all child elements are converted to text and joined with ` sep ` .

  - ` #get.stroke-paint( stroke, default: black ) ` : Returns the color of ` stroke ` . If no color information is available, ` default ` is used. (Deprecated, use ` stroke.paint ` instead.)

  - ` #get.stroke-thickness( stroke, default: 1pt ) ` : Returns the thickness of ` stroke ` . If no thickness information is available, ` default ` is used. (Deprecated, use ` stroke.thickness ` instead.)

  - ` #get.stroke-dict( stroke, ..overrides ) ` : Creates a dictionary with the keys necessary for a stroke. The returned dictionary is guaranteed to have the keys ` paint ` , ` thickness ` , ` dash ` , ` cap ` and ` join ` .

If ` stroke ` is a dictionary itself, all key-value pairs are copied to the
resulting stroke. Any named arguments in ` overrides ` will override the
previous value.

  - ` #get.inset-at( direction, inset, default: 0pt ) ` : Returns the inset (or outset) in a given ` direction ` , ascertained from ` inset ` .

  - ` #get.inset-dict( inset, ..overrides ) ` : Creates a dictionary usable as an inset (or outset) argument.

The resulting dictionary is guaranteed to have the keys ` top ` , ` left ` , `
bottom ` and ` right ` .

If ` inset ` is a dictionary itself, all key-value pairs are copied to the
resulting stroke. Any named arguments in ` overrides ` will override the
previous value.

  - ` #get.x-align( align, default:left ) ` : Returns the alignment along the x-axis from the passed-in ` align ` value. If none is present, ` default ` is returned. (Deprecated, use ` align.x ` instead.)

        #get.x-align(top + center) // center


  - ` #get.y-align( align, default:top ) ` : Returns the alignment along the y-axis from the passed-in ` align ` value. If none is present, ` default ` is returned. (Deprecated, use ` align.y ` instead.)

==  Math functions



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": math


Some functions to complement the native ` calc ` module.

  - ` #math.minmax( a, b ) ` : Returns an array with the minimum of ` a ` and ` b ` as the first element and the maximum as the second:

        #let (min, max) = math.minmax(a, b)


  - ` #math.clamp( min, max, value ) ` : Clamps a value between ` min ` and ` max ` . In contrast to ` calc.clamp() ` this function works for other values than numbers, as long as they are comparable.

        text-size = math.clamp(0.8em, 1.2em, text-size)


  - ` #lerp( min, max, t ) ` : Calculates the linear interpolation of ` t ` between ` min ` and ` max ` .

        #let width = math.lerp(0%, 100%, x)


` t ` should be a value between 0 and 1, but the interpolation works with
other values, too. To constrain the result into the given interval, use `
math.clamp ` :


        #let width = math.lerp(0%, 100%, math.clamp(0, 1, x))


  - ` #map( min, max, range-min, range-max, value ) ` : Maps a ` value ` from the interval ` [min, max] ` into the interval ` [range-min, range-max] ` :

        #let text-weight = int(math.map(8pt, 16pt, 400, 800, text-size))


==  Alias functions



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": alias


Some of the native Typst function as aliases, to prevent collisions with some
common argument names.

For example using ` numbering ` as an argument is not possible if the value is
supposed to be passed to the ` numbering() ` function. To still allow argument
names that are in line with the common Typst names (like ` numbering ` , `
align ` â¦), these alias functions can be used:



    #let excercise( no, numbering: "1)" ) = [
    	Exercise #alias.numbering(numbering, no)
    ]


The following functions have aliases right now:

  - ` numbering `
  - ` align `
  - ` type `
  - ` label `
  - ` text `
  - ` raw `
  - ` table `
  - ` list `
  - ` enum `
  - ` terms `
  - ` grid `
  - ` stack `
  - ` columns `

Manual](https://img.shields.io/badge/doc-.pdf-mediumpurple)
](https://github.com/maucejo/elsearticle/blob/main/docs/manual.pdf)

` elsearticle ` is a Typst template that aims to mimic the Elsevier article
LaTeX class, a.k.a. ` elsearticle.cls ` , provided by Elsevier to format
manuscript properly for submission to their journals.

==  Basic usage

This section provides the minimal amount of information to get started with
the template. For more detailed information, see the [ manual
](https://github.com/maucejo/elsearticle/blob/main/docs/manual.pdf) .

To use the ` elsearticle ` template, you need to include the following line at
the beginning of your ` typ ` file:



    #import "@preview/elsearticle:0.4.0": *


===  Initializing the template

After importing ` elsearticle ` , you have to initialize the template by a
show rule with the ` #elsearticle() ` command. This function takes an optional
argument to specify the title of the document.

  - ` title ` : Title of the paper
  - ` author ` : List of the authors of the paper
  - ` abstract ` : Abstract of the paper
  - ` journal ` : Name of the journal
  - ` keywords ` : List of keywords of the paper
  - ` format ` : Format of the paper. Possible values are ` preprint ` , ` review ` , ` 1p ` , ` 3p ` , ` 5p `
  - ` numcol ` : Number of columns of the paper. Possible values are 1 and 2
  - ` line-numbering ` : Enable line numbering. Possible values are ` true ` and ` false `

==  Additional features

The ` elsearticle ` template provides additional features to help you format
your document properly.

===  Appendix

To activate the appendix environment, all you have to do is to place the
following command in your document:



    #show: appendix

    // Appendix content here


===  Subfigures

Subfigures are not built-in features of Typst, but the ` elsearticle `
template provides a way to handle them. It is based on the ` subpar ` package
that allows you to create subfigures and properly reference them.



      #subfigure(
        figure(image("image1.png"), caption: []), <figa>,
        figure(image("image2.png"), caption: []), <figb>,
        columns: (1fr, 1fr),
        caption: [(a) Left image and (b) Right image],
        label: <fig>
      )


===  Equations

The ` elsearticle ` template provides the ` #nonumeq() ` function to create
unnmbered equations. The latter function can be used as follows:



    #nonumeq[$
      y = f(x)
      $
    ]


==  Roadmap

_Article format_

  - [x] Preprint
  - [x] Review
  - [x] 1p
  - [x] 3p
  - [x] 5p

_Environment_

  - [x] Implementation of the ` appendix ` environment

_Figures and tables_

  - [x] Implementation of the ` subfigure ` environment

![A preview of the modern-acad-cv Typst
template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/modern-acad-
cv-0.1.1-small.webp)

=  modern-acad-cv

0.1.1

A CV template for academics based on moderncv LaTeX package.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=modern-acad-cv&version=0.1.1)

This template for an academic CV serves the peculiarities of academic CVs. If
you are not an academic, this template is not useful. Most of the times in
academics, applicants need to show everything they have done. This makes it a
bit cumbersome doing it by single entries. In addition, academics might apply
to institutions around the globe, making it necessary to send translated CVs
or at least translations of some parts (i.e., title of papers in different
languages).

This template serves these special needs in introducting automated sections
based on indicated ` yaml ` -files. Furthermore, it has a simplified
multilingual support by setting different headers, title etc. for different
languages (by the user in the ` yaml ` -fields). With this template, it might
be more handy to keep your CV easier on track, especially when you need in
different languages, since managing a ` yaml ` -file is easier than checking
typesetting files against each other.

This template is influenced by LaTeXâs [ moderncv
](https://github.com/moderncv/moderncv) and its typst translation [ moderner-
cv ](https://github.com/DeveloperPaul123/modern-cv) .

==  Fonts

In this template, the use of FontAwesome icons via the [ fontawesome typst
package ](https://typst.app/universe/package/fontawesome) is possible, as well
as the icons from Academicons [ use-academicons typst package
](https://typst.app/universe/package/use-academicons) . To use these icons
properly, you need to install each fonts on your system. You can download [
fontawesome here ](https://fontawesome.com/download) and [ academicons here
](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) . Both typst packages will be load
by the template itself.

Furthermore, I included my favorite font [ Fira Sans
](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) . You can download it here [
here ](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) , or just change the font
argument in ` modern-acad-cv() ` .

==  Usage

The main function to load the construct of the academic CV is ` modern-acad-
cv() ` . After importing the template, you can call it right away. If you
donât have [ Fira Sans ](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans)
installed, choose a different font. Examples are given below.



    #import "@preview/modern-acad-cv:0.1.1": *

    #show: modern-acad-cv.with(
      metadata,
      multilingual,
      lang: "en",
      font: ("Fira Sans", "Andale Mono", "Roboto"),
      show-date: true,
      body
    )

    // ...


In the remainder, I show basic settings and how to use the automated functions
with the corresponding ` yaml ` -file.

===  Setting up the main file and the access to the ` yaml ` -files

A first step in your document is to invoke the template. Second, since this
template works with ` yaml ` -files in the background you need to specify
paths to each ` yaml ` -file you want to use throughout the document.

The template comes along with the ` metadata.yaml ` . In the beginning of this
yaml-file you set colors. Feel free to change it to your preferred color
scheme.



    colors:
      main_color: "#579D90"
      lightgray_color: "#d5d5d5"
      gray_color: "#737373"
      ...


At the beginning of your document, you just set then set the metadata-object:



    #import "@preview/modern-acad-cv:0.1.0": *

    #let metadata = yaml("metadata.yaml")


Initially, the ` metadata.yaml ` is located on the same level as the `
example.typ ` . All other ` yaml ` -files are saved in the folder ` dbs ` .
Since ` typ ` -documents search for paths from the root of the document in
that the function is called, you have to give the databases for the entry
along the ` metadata.yaml ` within each function call.

===  socials

Contact details are important. In this CV template, you have the possibility
to use fontawesome icons and academicons. To use socials, you just need to
specify in ` metadata.yaml ` , the wanted entries.

As you can see below, you set a category, i.e. email or lattes and then you
have to define four arguments: ` username ` , ` prefix ` , ` icon ` , and `
set ` . The ` username ` will be used for constructing the link and will be
shown next to the logo. The ` prefix ` is needed to build the valid link. The
` icon ` is the name of the icon in the respective set, which is chosen in `
set ` .



    personal:
      name: ["Mustermensch, Momo"]
      socials:
        email:
          username: momo@mustermensch.com
          prefix: "mailto:"
          icon: paper-plane
          set: fa
        homepage:
          username: momo.github.io
          prefix: https://
          icon: globe
          set: fa
        orcid:
          username: 0000-0000-0000-0000
          prefix: https://orcid.org
          icon: orcid
          set: ai
        lattes:
          username: "1234567891234567"
          prefix: http://lattes.cnpq.br/
          icon: lattes
          set: ai
        ...


===  Language setting & headers

In order to support changing headers, you need to specify the language and the
different content for each header in each language in the ` i18n.yaml ` in the
folder ` dbs ` .

The structure of the yaml is simple:



    lang:
      de:
        subtitle: Short CV
        education: Hochschulbildung
        work: Akademische Berufserfahrung (Auswahl)
        grants: FÃ¶rdermittel, Stipendien & Preise
        ...
      en:
        subtitle: Short CV
        education: Higher education
        work: Academic work experience (selection)
        grants: Scholarships & awards
        ...
      pt:
        subtitle: CurrÃ­culo
        education: FormaÃ§Ã£o acadÃªmica
        work: AtuaÃ§Ã£o profissional (seleÃ§Ã£o)
        grants: Bolsas de estudo e prÃ©mios
        ...


For each language, you want to use later, you have to define all the entries.
Reminder, donât change the entry names, since the functions wonât find it
under different names without changing the functions.

First you have to set up a variable that inherits the ISO-language code, save
the database into an object (here ` multilingual ` ) and then give the object
` multilingual ` and ` language ` to the function ` create-headers ` :



    // set the language of the document
    #let language = "pt"

    // loading multilingual database
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/i18n.yaml")

    // defining variables
    #let headerLabs = create-headers(multilingual, lang: language)


You create an object ` headerLabs ` that uses the function ` create-headers()
` which will define the headers as you provided in the ` yaml ` . Then by
switching the language object, all headers (if used accordingly to the naming
in the ` yaml ` ) will change directly.

Throughout the document you then reference the created ` headerLabs ` object.
If you change language, and values are provided, these automatically change.



    = #headerLabs.at("work")

    ...

    = #headerLabs.at("education")

    ...

    = #headerLabs.at("grants")


===  Automated functions

All of the following functions share common arguments: ` what ` , `
multilingual ` , and ` lang ` . In ` what ` , you always declare the database
you want to use with the function.

For example, to get work entries, you choose ` work ` , which you defined
beforehand as input from ` work.yaml ` . In the ` multilingual ` argument, you
just pass the ` multilingual ` object. In ` lang ` you pass your ` language `
object.



    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let work = yaml("dbs/work.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"

    // Function call with objects
    #cv-auto-stc(work, multilingual, lang: language)



===  Sorting publications and referencing your own name or correpsonding

Since ` typst ` so far does not support multiple bibliographies or subsetting
these, this function let you choose specific entries via the ` entries `
argument or group of entries by the ` tag ` argument. Furthermore, you can
indicate a string in ` me ` that can be highlighted in every output entry
(i.e., your formatted name). So far, this function leads to another function
that create APA-style format, if you want to use any other citation style, you
need to download the template on [ github ](https://github.com/bpkleer/modern-
acad-cv) , introduce your own styling and then add it in the ` cv-refs() `
function.



    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let refs = yaml("dbs/refs/yaml")

    // function call of group of peer-reviewed with tag `peer`
    #cv-refs(refs, multilingual, tag: "peer", me: [Mustermensch, M.], lang: language)


You see in the example pictures that I used this function to built five
different subheaders, i.e. for peer reviewed articles ( ` tag: "peer" ` ) and
chapters in edited books ( ` tag: "edited" ` ). You can define the tags how
you want, however, they need to put them into ` tag: <str> ` .

Sometimes, it is not only necessary to highlight your own name, you might also
want to indicate yourself as corresponding author. This can be done through
the ` refs.yaml ` which adhere to [ Hayagriva
](https://github.com/typst/hayagriva) . By adding an argument ` corresponding
` in the yaml and setting the value to ` true ` , a small ` C ` will appear
next to your name.



    Mustermensch2023:
      type: "article"
      date: 2023
      page-range: 55-78
      title: "Populism and Social Media: A Comparative Study of Political Mobilization"
      tags: "peer"
      author: [ "Mustermensch, Momo", "Rivera, Casey" ]
      corresponding: true
      parent:
        title: "Journal of Political Communication"
        volume: 41
        issue: 3
      serial-number:
        doi: "10.1016/j.jpolcom.2023.102865"


For applications abroad, it might be worth to translate at least title of the
publications so that other persons easily can see what the paper is about. In
every ` title ` argument, you can therefore provide a dictionary with the
language codes and the titles. Keep the original title in ` main ` and the
translations with the corresponding language shortcut (i.e., ` "en" ` or `
"pt" ` ). The function prints the main and translated title, depending on the
provided translation in the ` refs.yaml ` . Be aware, here you find not ` de `
in the dictionary, instead you find ` main ` . The original title needs to be
wrapped in ` main ` .



    Mustermensch2023:
      type: "article"
      date: 2023
      page-range: 55-78
      title:
        main: "Populismus und soziale Medien: Eine vergleichende Studie zur politischen Mobilisierung"
        en: "Populism and Social Media: A Comparative Study of Political Mobilization"
        pt: "Populismo e redes sociais: Um Estudo Comparativo de MobilizaÃ§Ã£o PolÃ­tica"
      tags: "peer"
      author: [ "Mustermensch, Momo", "Rivera, Casey" ]
      corresponding: true
      parent:
        title: "Journal of Political Communication"
        volume: 41
        issue: 3
      serial-number:
        doi: "10.1016/j.jpolcom.2023.102865"


===  cv-auto-skills()

Instead of just enumerating your skills or your knowledge of specific
software, you can build a skill-matrix with this function. In this skill-
matrix, you can have sections, i.e. _Computer Languages_ , _Programs_ and
_Languages_ . These sections are the highest level in the corresponding `
skills.yaml ` :



    computer:
      ...
    programs:
      ...
    languages:
      ...



You can then define in each categories specific skills, i.e. German and
Portuguese in ` languages ` :



    computer:
      ...
    programs:
      ...
    languages:
      german:
        ...
      portugues:
       ...



For each entry, you have to define ` name ` , ` level ` and ` description ` .



    languages:
      ...
      pt:
        name:
          de: Portugiesisch
          en: Portuguese
          pt: PortuguÃªs
        level: 3
        description:
          de: fortgeschritten
          en: advanced
          pt: avanÃ§ado


As you can see, you can again define language-dependent names in ` name ` and
descriptions in ` description ` . ` level ` is a numeric value and indicates
how many of the four boxes are filled to indicate you level of proficiency. If
you donât have the need for a CV of different languages, you can directly
define ` name ` or ` description ` .

You have to call the function with three objects ` skills ` , ` multilingual `
, and ` metadata ` and the corresponding ` language ` of the document:



    #let skills = yaml("dbs/skills.yaml")
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let metadata = yaml("dbs/metadata.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"

    #cv-auto-skills(skills, multilingual, metadata, lang: language)


===  Print your info without any formatting

The function ` cv-auto ` is the base function for printing the provided infos
in the specified ` yaml ` file with no further formatting. The functions ` cv-
auto-stc ` and ` cv-auto-stp ` do only differ in the point that ` cv-auto-stc
` both give the title in bold, ` cv-auto-stp ` puts the subtitle in
parentheses and ` cv-auto-stc ` puts the subtitle after a comma.

The structure of the corresponding ` yaml ` files is simple: in each entry you
can have the following entries: ` title ` , ` subtitle ` , ` location ` , `
description ` and ` left ` . ` title ` is mandatory, ` subtitle ` , ` location
` , and ` description ` are voluntary. In all functions you need to specify `
left ` , which indicates period of time, or year. For ` title ` , ` subtitle `
, ` location ` , and ` description ` , you can provide a dictionary for
different languages (see below).



    master:
      title:
        de: Master of Arts
        en: Master of Arts
        pt: PÃ³s-GraduaÃ§Ã£o
      subtitle:
        de: Sozialwissenschaften
        en: Social Sciences
        pt: CiÃªncias Sociais
      location:
        de: Exzellenz-UniversitÃ¤t
        en: University of Excellence
        pt: Universidade de ExcelÃªncia
      description:
        de: mit Auszeichnung
        en: with distinction
        pt: com distinÃ§Ã£o
      left: "2014"


In your main document, you then easily call the function and transfer the
standard arguments ` what ` , ` metadata ` , and ` lang ` .



    // section of education
    #let education = yaml("dbs/education.yaml")
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"

    #cv-auto-stp(education, multilingual, lang: language)

    // section of work positions
    #let work = yaml("dbs/work.yaml")
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"

    #cv-auto-stc(work, multilingual, lang: language)

    // section of given talks
    #let talks = yaml("dbs/talks.yaml")
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"

    #cv-auto(talks, multilingual, lang: language)


===  Creating a list instead of single entrie

Sometimes, instead of giving every entry, you want to group by year. Another
example for this case could be that you want to summarize your memberships or
reviewer duties.

The function ` cv-auto-list ` uses just the standard input:



    #let conferences = yaml("dbs/conferences.yaml")
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"

    #cv-auto-list(conferences, multilingual, lang: language)


The corresponding ` yaml ` file is differently organized: The entry point in
the file is the corresponding year. In every year, you organize your entries
(i.e. conference participations). In each entry in a year, you have the ` name
` and ` action ` entry. You can provide a dictionary for the ` name ` . For `
action ` , I used ` P ` and ` C ` , for _paper/presentation_ and _chair_ . You
can then manually define this upfront the function call for the reader, or you
use the ` i18n.yaml ` , indicate the explanations for each language in ` exp-
confs ` and then it automatically changes with the specific language code.



    "2024":
      conference2:
        name: European Conference on Gender and Politics
        action: P
      conference1:
        name: ECPR General Conference
        action: P, C


The action will be added after each conference name in superscripts.

===  Creating a table

This case is mostly used for listing your prior teaching experience. The
corresponding ` teaching.yaml ` for this description, is organized as
followed:



    "2024":
      course1:
        summer: T
        name:
          de: "Statistik+: Einstieg in R leicht gemacht"
          en: "Statistics+: Starting with R (de)"
          pt: "EstatÃ­stica+: ComeÃ§ando com R (de)"
        study:
          de: Bachelor
          en: Bachelor
          pt: GraduaÃ§Ã£o
      ...


First you indicate the year ` "2024" ` and then you organize all courses you
gave within that year (i.e. here ` course1 ` ). Mandatory are ` name ` and `
study ` . For both you can indicate a single value or a dictionary
corresponding to your chosen languages. You can provide ` summer ` if you want
to indicate differences for terms. This is ` boolean ` , the specific word is
then given in the ` i18n.yaml ` under ` table-winter ` resp. ` table-summer `
.

The function then uses again just the standard arguments and plots a table
with the indicated year, name, and study area.



    #let teaching = yaml("dbs/teaching.yaml")
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"

    #cv-table-teaching(teaching, multilingual, lang: language)


===  cv-auto-cats()

In case you want to directly print entries from categories that belong to one
` yaml ` -file, you can use ` cv-auto-cats ` . This will print the header for
each subcategory and then the belonging entries.

An example is given in ` training.yaml ` . In this file, further training is
given by categories (i.e., methods and didactics). Within the categories you
have here courses and then ` title ` , ` location ` , and ` left ` . `
location ` and ` title ` can be dictionaries if you want to translate between
different languages.



    methods:
      course2:
        title: Bayesian modelling in the Social Sciences
        location: An expensive Spring Seminar
        left: "2024"
      ...
    didactics:
      course2:
        title:
          de: Konfliktkompetenz I + II
          en: Conflict competence I + II
          pt: CompetÃªncia de conflitos I + II
        location:
          de: UniversitÃ¤tsallianz
          en: University Alliance
          pt: AlianÃ§a UniversitÃ¡ria
        left: "2019"


Call the function as usal:



    #let training = yaml("dbs/training.yaml")
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"
    #let headerLabs = create-headers(multilingual, lang: language)

    #cv-auto-cats(training, multilingual, headerLabs, lang: language)


===  Special cases: long names

If you have a long name that crosses the social media side, just set the
argument ` split ` to ` true ` within ` metadata.yaml ` :



    ...
      personal:
        name: ["Mustermensch, Momo"]
        split: true
      ...

This package provides functions that replace actual text with random
characters, which is useful for redacting confidential information or sharing
the design and structure of an existing document without disclosing the
content itself. A variety of ready-made sets of characters for replacement are
available (75 in total; termed _alphabets_ ), representing diverse writing
systems, codes, notations and symbols. Some of these are more conservative
(such as emulating redaction using a wide black pen) and many are more
whimsical, as demonstrated by the following example:



    #baffle(alphabet: "welsh")[Hello]. My #tippex[name] is #baffle(alphabet: "underscore")[Inigo Montoya]. You #baffle(alphabet: "alchemy")[killed] my #baffle(alphabet: "shavian")[father]. Prepare to #redact[die].

    Using show rules strings, regular expressions and other selectors can be redacted automatically:

    #show "jan Maja": baffle.with(alphabet: "sitelen-pona")
    #show regex("[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&â*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*"): baffle.with(alphabet: "maze-3")

    Iâm jan Maja, and my email is `foo@digitalwords.net`.

Using  Babel  is quite straightforward. A [ *comprehensive manual*
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/babel/0.1.1/docs/manual.pdf)
covers:

  - Introductory background.
  - How to use the provided functions ( ` baffle() ` , ` redact() ` and ` tippex() ` ).
  - A list of the provided alphabets, each demonstrated by a line of random text.

If the version of the precompiled manual doesnât match the version of the
package, it means no difference between the two versions is reflected in the
manual.

If you wish to share the Typst source files of your document, not just the
precompiled output, a tool called [ _Typst Mutilate_
](https://github.com/frozolotl/typst-mutilate) might be useful for you. Unlike
Babel  , it is not a Typst package but an external tool, written in Rust. It
replaces the content of a Typst document with random words selected from a
wordlist or random characters (similarly to  Babel  ), changing the document
in place (so make sure to run it on a _copy_ !). As a package for Typst,
Babel  cannot change your source files.

= *outline-summaryst.md*

=  outline-summaryst

0.1.0

A basic template for including a summary for each entry in the table of
contents. Useful for writing books.

==  Description

` outline-summaryst ` is a basic package designed for including a summary for
each entry in the table of contents, particularly useful for writing books. It
provides a simple structure for organizing content and generating formatted
documents with summary sections.

==  Features

  - A template for the outline, which styles both the heading and their summaries.
  - A macro for creating new headings and a summary for each heading.

==  Note:

Because of the way the project is implemented, only the headings created with
the provided ` make-heading("heading name", "summary") ` are shown in in the
outline. Headings created with the default ` = Heading ` syntax will not show
in said outline (though they will show up in the document itself).

==  Example Usage:



    #import "@preview/outline-summaryst:0.1.0": style-outline, make-heading


    // you can set `outline-title: none` in order not to display any title
    #show outline: style-outline.with(outline-title: "Table of Contents")

    #outline()


    #make-heading("Part One", "This is the summary for part one")
    #lorem(500)

    #make-heading("Chapter One", "Summary for chapter one in part one", level: 2)
    #lorem(300)

    #make-heading("Chapter Two", "This is the summary for chapter two in part one", level: 2)
    #lorem(300)

    #make-heading("Part Two", "And here we have the summary for part two")
    #lorem(500)

    #make-heading("Chapter One", "Summary for chapter one in part two", level: 2)
    #lorem(300)

    #make-heading("Chapter Two", "Summary for chapter two in part two", level: 2)
    #lorem(300)


==  Known limitations

  - Currently, we do not provide a way for styling the table of contents or headings

= *blinky.md*

=  blinky

0.1.0

Typesets paper titles in bibliographies as hyperlinks.

This package permits the creation of Typst bibliographies in which paper
titles are typeset as hyperlinks. Hereâs an example (with links typeset in
blue):

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexanderkoller/typst-
blinky/main/examples/screenshot.png)

The bibliography is generated from a Bibtex file, and citations are done with
the usual Typst mechanisms. The hyperlinks are specified through DOI or URL
fields in the Bibtex entries; if such a field is present, the title of the
entry will be automatically typeset as a hyperlink.

See [ here ](https://github.com/alexanderkoller/typst-
blinky/tree/main/examples) for a full example.

==  Usage

Adding hyperlinks to your bibliography is a two-step process: (a) use a CSL
style with magic symbols (explained below), and (b) enclose the ` bibliography
` command with the ` link-bib-urls ` function:



    #import "@preview/blinky:0.1.0": link-bib-urls

    ... @cite something ... @cite more ...

    #let bibsrc = read("custom.bib")
    #link-bib-urls(bibsrc)[
      #bibliography("custom.bib", style: "./association-for-computational-linguistics-blinky.csl")
    ]


Observe that the Bibtex file ` custom.bib ` is loaded twice: once to load into
` link-bib-urls ` and once in the standard Typst ` bibliography ` command.
Obviously, this needs to be the same file twice. See under âAlternative
solutionsâ below why this canât be simplified further at the moment.

If a Bibtex entry contains a DOI field, the title will become a hyperlink to
the DOI. Otherwise, if the Bibtex entry contains a URL field, the title will
become a hyperlink to this URL. Otherwise, the title will be shown as normal,
without a link.

==  CSL with magic symbols

Blinky generates the hyperlinked titles through a regex show rule that
replaces a âmagic symbolâ with a [ link
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/link/) command. This âmagic
symbolâ is a string of the form ` !!BIBENTRY!<key>!! ` , where ` <key> ` is
the Bibtex citation key of the reference.

You will therefore need to tweak your CSL style to use it with Blinky.
Specifically, in every place where you would usually have the paper title,
i.e.





or similar, your CSL file now instead needs to print a decorated version of
the paperâs citation-key (= Bibtex key):





You can have more prefix before and suffix after the ` !!BIBENTRY! ` and ` !!
` , as in the example, but these magic symbols need to be there so Blinky can
find the places in the document where the hyperlinked title needs to be
inserted.

You can check the [ example CSL file
](https://github.com/alexanderkoller/typst-
blinky/blob/main/examples/association-for-computational-linguistics-
blinky.csl) to see what this looks like in practice; compare to [ the
unmodified original ](https://github.com/citation-style-
language/styles/blob/master/association-for-computational-linguistics.csl) .

==  Alternative solutions

The current mechanism in Blinky is somewhat heavy-handed: a Typst plugin uses
the [ biblatex ](https://github.com/typst/biblatex) crate to parse the Bibtex
file (independently of the normal operations of the ` bibliography ` command),
and then all occurrences of the magic symbol in the Typst bibliography are
replaced by the hyperlinked titles.

It would be great to replace this mechanism by something simpler, but it is
actually remarkably tricky to make bibliography titles hyperlinks with the
current version of Typst (0.11.1). All the alternatives that I could think of
donât work. Here are some of them:

  - Print the URL/DOI using the CSL style, and then use a regex show rule to convert it into a ` link ` around the title somehow. This does not work because most URLs contain a colon character (:), and these [ cause trouble with Typst regexes ](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/86) .
  - Make the CSL style output text of the form ` #link(url)[title] ` . This does not work because the content generated by CSL is not evaluated further by Typst. Also, Typst [ does not support show rules for the individual bibliography items ](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/942) , which makes it tricky to call [ eval ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/eval/) on them.
  - Create a show rule for ` link ` . Some CSL styles already generate ` link ` elements if a URL/DOI is present in the bib entry - one could consider replacing it with a ` link ` whose URL is the same as before, but the text is a link symbol or some such. However, a show rule for a link that generates another link runs into an infinite recursion; Typst made [ the deliberate decision ](https://github.com/typst/typst/pull/3327) to handle such recursions only for ` text ` show rules.
  - The best solution would be to simply use an unmodified CSL file, but it is not clear to me how one would pick out the paper title from the bibliography in a general way. Iâm afraid that any solution that hyperlinks titles will require modifications to the CSL style.

It would furthermore be desirable to hide the fact that we are reading the
same Bibtex file twice behind a single function call. However, code in a Typst
package [ resolves all filenames relative to the package directory
](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2126) , which means that the package
cannot access a bibliography file outside of the package directory. We may be
able to simplify this once [ #971 ](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/971)
gets addressed.

=  linguify

0.4.1

Load strings for different languages easily

Load strings for different languages easily. This can be useful if you create
a package or template for multilingual usage.

==  Usage

The usage depends if you are using it inside a package or a template or in
your own document.

===  For end users and own templates

You can use linguify global database.

Example:



    #import "@preview/linguify:0.4.0": *

    #let lang_data = toml("lang.toml")
    #set-database(lang_data);

    #set text(lang: "de")

    #linguify("abstract")  // Shows "Zusammenfassung" in the document.


The ` lang.toml ` musst look like this:



    [conf]
    default-lang = "en"

    [en]
    title = "A simple linguify example"
    abstract = "Abstract"

    [de]
    title = "Ein einfaches Linguify Beispiel"
    abstract = "Zusammenfassung"


===  Inside a package

So that multiple packages can use linguify simultaneously, they should contain
their own database. A linguify database is just a dictionary with a certain
structure. (See database structure.)

Recommend is to store the database in a separate file like ` lang.toml ` and
load it inside the document. And specify it in each ` linguify() ` function
call.

Example:



    #import "@preview/linguify:0.4.0": *

    #let database = toml("lang.toml")

    #linguify("key", from: database, default: "key")


==  Features

  - Use a ` toml ` or other file to load strings for different languages. You need to pass a typst dictionary which follows the structure of the shown toml file.
  - Specify a *default-lang* . If none is specified it will default to ` en `
  - *Fallback* to the default-lang if a key is not found for a certain language.
  - [ Fluent ](https://projectfluent.org/) support

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` linguify `



    #import "@preview/linguify:0.4.1"

0.0.4

Complex tables, written concisely

This is a library for [ Typst ](https://typst.app/) built upon Pg Bielâs
fabulous [ ` tablex ` ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex) library.

It allows the creation of complex tables in Typst using a compact syntax based
on the ` tbl ` preprocessor for the traditional UNIX TROFF typesetting system.
There are also some novel features that are not currently offered by Typst
itself or ` tablex ` , namely:

  - Decimal point alignment (using the ` decimalpoint ` region option and ` N ` -classified columns)
  - Columns of equal width (using the ` e ` column modifier)
  - Columns with a guaranteed minimum width (using the ` w ` column modifier)
  - Cells that are ignored when calculating column widths (using the ` z ` column modifier)
  - Equation tables (using the ` mode: "math" ` region option)

Many other features exist to condense common configurations to a concise
syntax.

For example:



    #import "@preview/tbl:0.0.4"
    #show: tbl.template.with(box: true, tab: "|")

    ```tbl
          R | L
          R   N.
    software|version
    _
         AFL|2.39b
        Mutt|1.8.0
        Ruby|1.8.7.374
    TeX Live|2015
    ```

Many other examples and copious documentation are provided in the [ `
README.pdf ` ](https://maxre.es/tbl.typ/v0.0.4.pdf) file.

[ The source repository ](https://github.com/maxcrees/tbl.typ) also includes a
test suite based on those examples, which can be ran using the GNU ` make `
command. See ` make help ` for details.

= *alchemist.md*

=  alchemist

0.1.2

A package to render skeletal formulas using cetz

Featured  Package

Alchemist is a typst package to draw skeletal formulae. It is based on the [
chemfig ](https://ctan.org/pkg/chemfig) package. The main goal of alchemist is
not to reproduce one-to-one chemfig. Instead, it aims to provide an interface
to achieve the same results in Typst.



    #skeletize({
      molecule(name: "A", "A")
      single()
      molecule("B")
      branch({
        single(angle: 1)
        molecule(
          "W",
          links: (
            "A": double(stroke: red),
          ),
        )
        single()
        molecule(name: "X", "X")
      })
      branch({
        single(angle: -1)
        molecule("Y")
        single()
        molecule(
          name: "Z",
          "Z",
          links: (
            "X": single(stroke: black + 3pt),
          ),
        )
      })
      single()
      molecule(
        "C",
        links: (
          "X": cram-filled-left(fill: blue),
          "Z": single(),
        ),
      )
    })


![links](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robotechnic/alchemist/master/images/links1.png)

Alchemist uses cetz to draw the molecules. This means that you can draw cetz
shapes in the same canvas as the molecules. Like this:



    #skeletize({
      import cetz.draw: *
      double(absolute: 30deg, name: "l1")
      single(absolute: -30deg, name: "l2")
      molecule("X", name: "X")
      hobby(
        "l1.50%",
        ("l1.start", 0.5, 90deg, "l1.end"),
        "l1.start",
        stroke: (paint: red, dash: "dashed"),
        mark: (end: ">"),
      )
      hobby(
        (to: "X.north", rel: (0, 1pt)),
        ("l2.end", 0.4, -90deg, "l2.start"),
        "l2.50%",
        mark: (end: ">"),
      )
    })


![cetz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robotechnic/alchemist/master/images/cetz1.png)

==  Usage

To start using alchemist, just use the following code:



    #import "@preview/alchemist:0.1.2": *

    #skeletize({
      // Your molecule here
    })


For more information, check the [ manual
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robotechnic/alchemist/master/doc/manual.pdf)
.

=  showman

0.1.2

Eval & show typst code outputs inline with their source

![](https://www.github.com/ntjess/showman/raw/v0.1.0/showman.jpg)

- * *

Automagic tools to smooth the package documentation & development process.

  - Package your files for local typst installation or PR submission in one command

  - Provide your readme in typst format with code block examples, and let ` showman ` do the rest! In one command, it will the readme to markdown and render code block outputs as included images.

    - Bonus points â let ` showman ` know your repository path and it will ensure images will properly appear in your readme even after your package has been distributed through typstâs registry.
  - Execute non-typst code blocks and render their outputs

*Prerequisites* : Make sure you have ` typst ` and ` pandoc ` available from
the command line. Then, in a python virtual environment, run:



    pip install showman


Create a typst file with ` ```example ` code blocks that show the output you
want to include in your readme. For instance:



    #import "@preview/cetz:0.1.2"
    // Just to avoid showing this heading in the readme itself
    #set heading(outlined: false)

    = Hello, world!
    Let's do something complicated:

    #cetz.canvas({
      import cetz.plot
      import cetz.palette
      cetz.draw.set-style(axes: (tick: (length: -.05)))
      // Plot something
      plot.plot(size: (3,3), x-tick-step: 1, axis-style: "left", {
          for i in range(0, 3) {
          plot.add(domain: (-4, 2),
          x => calc.exp(-(calc.pow(x + i, 2))),
          fill: true, style: palette.tango)
        }
      })
    })


![Example
1](https://www.github.com/ntjess/showman/raw/v0.1.0/assets/example-1.png)

Then, run the following command:



    showman md


Congrats, you now have a readme with inline images ð

You can optionally specify your workspace root, output file name, image
folder, etc. These options are visible under ` showman md --help ` .

*Note* : You can customize the appearance of these images by providing `
showman ` the template to use when creating them. In your file to be rendered,
create a variable called ` showman-config ` at the outermost scope:



    // Render images with a black background and red text
    #let showman-config = (
      template: it => {
        set text(fill: red)
        rect(fill: black, it)
      }
    )


Behind the scenes, showman imports your file as a module and looks for this
variable. If it is found, your template and a few other options are injected
into the example rendering process.

*Note* : If every example has the same setup (package imports, etc.), and
you donât want the text to be included in your examples, you can pass `
eval-kwargs ` in this config as well to specify a string that gets prefixed to
every example. Alternatively, pass variables in a scope directly:



    // Setup either through providing scope or import prefixes
    #let my-variable = 5
    #let showman-config = (
      eval-kwargs: (
        prefix: "#import \"@preview/cetz:0.1.2\"
      ),
      // Now you can use `my-var` in your examples
      scope: (my-var: my-variable)
    )


==  Caveats

  - ` showman ` uses the beautiful ` pandoc ` to do most of the markdown conversion heavy lifting. So, if your document canât be processed by pandoc, you may need to adjust your syntax until pandoc is happy making a markdown document.

  - Typst doesnât allow page styling inside containers. Since ` showman ` must use containers to extract each rendered example, you canât use ` #set page(...) ` or ` #pagebreak() ` inside your examples.

If you donât care about converting your readme to markdown, itâs even
easier to have example rendered alongside their code. Simply add the following
preamble to your file:



    #import "@preview/showman:0.1.1"
    #show: showman.formatter.template

    The code below will be rendered side by side with its output:

    ``` typst
    = Hello world!
    ```
    ![Example 2](https://www.github.com/ntjess/showman/raw/v0.1.0/assets/example-2.png)

    Several keywords can be privded to customize appearance and more. See `showman.formatter.template` for more details.


Youâve done the hard work of creating a beautiful, well-documented manual.
Now itâs time to share it with the world. ` showman ` can help you package
your files for distribution in one command, after some minimal setup.

  1. Make sure you have a ` typst.toml ` file that follows typst [ packaging guidelines ](https://github.com/typst/packages)

  2. Add a new block to your toml file as follows:



    [tool.packager]
    paths = [...]


Where ` paths ` is a list of files and directories you want to include in your
package.

  3. Run the following command from the root of your repository:



    showman package


  4. Without any other arguments, youâve just installed your package in your systemâs local typst packages folder. Now you can import it with ` typst #import "@local/mypackage:<version>" ` .

     - You can alternatively specify the path to your fork of ` typst/packages ` to prep your files for a PR, or specify a ` --namespace ` other than ` local ` .

*Note* : You can see the full list of command options with ` showman package
--help ` .

This package also executes non-typst code (currently bash on non-windows,
python, and c++). You can use ` showman execute ./path/to/file.typ ` to
execute code blocks in these languages, and the output will be captured in a `
.coderunner.json ` file in the root directory you specified. To enable this
feature, you need to add the following preamble to your file:



    #import "@preview/showman:0.1.1": runner

    #let cache = json("/.coderunner.json").at("path/to/file.typ", default: (:))
    #let show-rule = runner.external-code.with(result-cache: cache)

    // Now, apply the show rule to languages that have a `showman execute` result:
    #show raw.where(lang: "python"): show-rule


You can optionally style ` <example-input> ` and ` <example-output> ` labels
to customize how input and output blocks appear. For even deeper
customization, you can specify the ` container ` that displays the input and
output blocks that accepts a keyword ` direction ` and positional ` input `
and ` output ` .

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` showman `

Scrutinize is a library for building exams, tests, etc. with Typst. It has
three general areas of focus:

  - It helps with grading information: record the points that can be reached for each question and make them available for creating grading keys.
  - It provides a selection of question writing utilities, such as multiple choice or true/false questions.
  - It supports the creation of sample solutions by allowing to switch between the normal and âpre-filledâ exam.

Right now, providing a styled template is not part of this packageâs scope.
Also, visual customization of the provided question templates is currently
nonexistent.

See the [ manual
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scrutinize/0.3.0/docs/manual.pdf)
for details.

= *latedef.md*

=  latedef

0.1.0

Use now, define later

_Use now, define later!_

==  Basic usage

This package exposes a single function, ` latedef-setup ` .



    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(simple: true)

    My #undef is #undef.
    #def("dog")
    #def("cool")


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/latedef/0.1.0/example-
images/1.png)

Note that the definition doesnât actually have to come _after_ the usage,
but if you want to define something beforehand, youâre better off using a
variable instead.



    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(simple: true)

    // Instead of
    #def("A")
    The first letter is #undef.

    // you should use
    #let A = "A"
    The first letter is #A.


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/latedef/0.1.0/example-
images/2.png)

==  The ` simple ` parameter

When ` simple: false ` (which is the default), ` undef ` becomes a function
you have to call. It takes an optional positional or named parameter ` id ` of
type ` str ` , which can be used to define things out of order.



    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup() // or `latedef-setup(simple: false)`

    // Note that you can still call it without an id, which works just like when `simple: true`.
    My letters are #undef("1"), #undef(id: "2"), and #undef().

    // `def` now takes one positional and either another positional or a named parameter.
    #def("C")
    #def(id: "2", "B")
    #def("1", "A")


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/latedef/0.1.0/example-
images/3.png)

==  The ` footnote ` parameter

This is a convenience feature that automatically wraps ` undef ` in ` footnote
` , either directly (when ` simple: true ` ) or as a function (when ` simple:
false ` ).

This corresponds to LaTeXâs ` \footnotemark ` and ` \footnotetext ` , hence
the different names in the example.



    #let (fmark, ftext) = latedef-setup(simple: true, footnote: true)
    Do#fmark you#fmark believe#fmark in God?#fmark

    #let wdym = "What do you mean"
    #ftext[#wdym "Do"?]
    #ftext[#wdym "you"?]
    #ftext[#wdym "believe"?]
    #ftext[And w#wdym.slice(1) "God"?]


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/latedef/0.1.0/example-
images/4.png)

==  The ` stand-in ` parameter

This is a function that takes a single positional parameter ( ` id ` ) of type ` none | str ` and produces a stand-in value that gets shown when a late-defined value is missing a corresponding definition.


    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup()
    // This is the default stand-in
    #undef()
    #undef("with an id")

    // Custom stand-in
    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(stand-in: id => emph[No #id!])
    #undef()
    #undef("id")


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/latedef/0.1.0/example-
images/5.png)

Since ` stand-in ` is a function, which is only called when a definition is
actually missing, you can even set it to panic to enforce that all late-
defined values have a definiton.



    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(stand-in: id => panic("Missing definition for value with id " + repr(id)))
    #undef()
    #undef("id")


The output will look something like



    error: panicked with: "Missing definition for value with id none"
      ââ example.typ:1:50
      â
      â #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(stand-in: id => panic("Missing definition for value with id " + repr(id)))
      â                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    error: panicked with: "Missing definition for value with id \"id\""
      ââ example.typ:1:50
      â
      â #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(stand-in: id => panic("Missing definition for value with id " + repr(id)))
      â                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


And there is no error when everything has a definition:



    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(stand-in: id => panic("Missing definition for value with id " + repr(id)))
    #undef() is #undef("id").
    #def("This")
    #def("id", "fine")


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/latedef/0.1.0/example-
images/6.png)

==  The ` group ` parameter

Sometimes you may want to use multiple instances of ` latedef ` in parallel.
This is done using the ` group ` parameter, which can be ` none ` (the
default) or any ` str ` .

Note that using ` footnote: true ` sets the default group to ` "footnote" `
instead.



    // Use a group for the figure stuff...
    #let (caption-undef, caption) = latedef-setup(simple: true, group: "figure")
    #let figure = std.figure.with(caption: caption-undef)
    // ...so you can still use the regular mechanism in parallel.
    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(simple: true)

    #figure(raw(block: true, lorem(5)))
    #caption[The #undef _lorem ipsum_.]
    #def("classic")

images/7.png)

0.4.0

Paper template for submission to International Conference on Learning
Representations (ICLR)

Featured  Template

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=clear-iclr&version=0.4.0)

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking _Start from
template_ on the dashboard and searching for ` clear-iclr ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/clear-iclr


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` iclr ` function with the following named
arguments.

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.

  - ` authors ` : An array of author dictionaries. Each of the author dictionaries must have a name key and can have the keys department, organization, location, and email.

        #let authors = (
      ...,
      (
        names: ([Coauthor1], [Coauthor2]),
        affilation: [Affiliation],
        address: [Address],
        email: "correspondent@example.org",
      ),
      ...
    )


  - ` keywords ` : Publication keywords (used in PDF metadata).

  - ` date ` : Creation date (used in PDF metadata).

  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or none. Appears at the top under the title.

  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the bibliography function or none. The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the paper.

  - ` appendix ` : Content to append after bibliography section (can be included).

  - ` accepted ` : If this is set to ` false ` then anonymized ready for submission document is produced; ` accepted: true ` produces camera-redy version. If the argument is set to ` none ` then preprint version is produced (can be uploaded to arXiv).

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` iclr `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule at the top of your file.

==  Issues

This template is developed at [ daskol/typst-templates
](https://github.com/daskol/typst-templates) repo. Please report all issues
there.

  - Common issue is related to Typstâs inablity to produce colored annotation. In order to mitigte the issue, we add a script which modifies annotations and make them colored.

        ../colorize-annotations.py \
        example-paper.typst.pdf example-paper-colored.typst.pdf


See [ [ README.md ](http://readme.md/) ][3] for details.

  - The author instructions says that preferable font is MS Times New Roman but the official example paper uses serifs like Computer Modern and Nimbus font families. Monospace fonts are not specified.

  - ICML-like bibliography style. The bibliography slightly differs from the one in the original example paper. The main difference is that we prefer to use authorâs lastname at first place to search an entry faster.

An official report template for the 'Informatique et systÃ¨mes de

(HEI) in Sion, Switzerland.

Officially affiliated

](https://hevs.ch/isc)

This is an official template for students reports for the [ ISC degree
programme ](https://isc.hevs.ch/) at the School of engineering in Sion.

==  Using the template

In the ` Typst ` web application, start with the ` isc-hei-report ` and voilÃ
! Using the CLI, you can initialize the project with the command :



    typst init @preview/isc-hei-report:0.1.5


This template will initialize an sample report with sensible default values.

==  Installing fonts locally

If you are running ` typst ` locally, you might miss some of the required
fonts. For your convenience, a font download script is included in this repos.
As all the fonts are released under the [ SIL Open Font License
](https://openfontlicense.org/) , there are no file inclusion issues here.

To the install the fonts locally in a Linux environment, simply type



    source install_fonts.sh


from within the ` fonts ` directory.

==  PDF images inclusion

Unfortunately, ` typst ` does not support PDF file types inclusion at the time
of writing this documentation. As a temporary workaround, PDF files can be
converted to SVG via ` pdf2svg ` .

When used locally, creating a PDF is straightforward with the command



    typst compile report.typ


Even nicer, the following command compiles the report every time the file is
modified.



    typst watch report.typ


Another nice possibility is of course to use a VScod[e | ium] via the ` Typst LSP ` plugin which enables direct compilation.

In the future, several things _might_ be updated, such as :

  - [ ] State diagrams and UML diagrams examples
  - [ ] Glossary inclusion
  - [ ] Master thesis version of this template
  - [ ] Themes for code
  - [ ] Other nice things
  - [x] Appendix
  - [x] Acronyms inclusion
  - [x] Basic support for including code files

If you need any help for installing or running those tools, do not hesitate to
get in touch with its maintainer [ pmudry ](https://github.com/pmudry) .

You can of course also propose changes using PR or raise issues if something
is not clear. Have fun writing reports!

Randziffern in Typst

[ _Randziffern_
](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Randnummer&oldid=231943223) (also
called _Randnummern_ ) are a way to reference text passages in a document,
independent of the page number or the section number. They are used in many
German legal texts, for example. This package provides a way to create
_Randziffern_ in Typst.

==  Demo

![left page with Randziffern on the left of the text](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/jurz/0.1.0/demo-2.svg) |  ![right page with Randziffern on the right of the text](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/jurz/0.1.0/demo-3.svg)
---|---
View source



    #show: init-jurz.with(
      gap: 1em,
      two-sided: true
    )

    #rz #lorem(50)

    #lorem(20)

    #rz<abc> #lorem(30)

    #rz #lorem(40)

    #rz #lorem(50)

    #lorem(20)

    #rz #lorem(24)

    Fur further information, look at @abc.


==  Reference

===  ` init-jurz `

A show rule that initializes the _Randziffern_ for the document. This rule
should be placed at the beginning of the document. It also allows customizing
the behavior of the _Randziffern_ .

====  Usage



    #show: init-jurz.with(
     // parameters
     // two-sided: true,
     // gap: 1em,
     // supplement: "Rz.",
     // reset-level: 0,
    )


====  Parameters

  - ` two-sided ` (optional): If ` true ` , the _Randziffern_ are placed on the outer margin of the page. If ` false ` , they are placed on the left margin. Default is ` true ` .
  - ` gap ` (optional): The distance between the _Randziffer_ and the text. Default is ` 1em ` .
  - ` supplement ` (optional): The text that is placed before the _Randziffer_ when referencing it. Default is ` "Rz." ` .
  - ` reset-level ` (optional): The heading level at which the _Randziffern_ are reset. If set to ` 3 ` , for example, the numbering of the _Randziffern_ restarts after every heading of levels ` 1 ` , ` 2 ` , or ` 3 ` . Default is ` 0 ` .

===  ` rz `

Adds a _Randziffer_ to the text. The _Randziffer_ is a unique identifier that
can be referenced in the text.

You can add references the same way you can with headings. In fact, the
_Randziffer_ is treated as a heading of level ` 99 ` under the hood.

====  Usage



    #rz #lorem(100)
    #rz<abc> #lorem(100)

    See also @abc.

==  Usage

> If you are using Typst online editor, you donât have to follow local
> development steps.

===  1\. Install Fonts

In order to make Typst render correctly, you will have to install the required
fonts [ *Roboto* ](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) , [ *Source
Sans Pro* ](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3) (or *Source
Sans 3* ) as well as [ Fontawesome 6 ](https://fontawesome.com/download) in
your local system.

_NOTE: For online editor, Source Sans Pro are already included; however you
will still have to manually upload the` .otf ` or ` .ttf ` files of
*Fontawesome* and *Roboto* to your project, by creating a folder ` fonts `
and put all the ` otf ` files there. See [ Issue
](https://github.com/typst/webapp-issues/issues/401) _

===  2\. Check Documentation

A [ documentation ](https://mintyfrankie.github.io/brilliant-CV/docs.pdf) on
CV functions is provided for reference.

===  3\. Bootstrap Template

You have two ways to bootstrap the template, according to your need and tech-
savvy level.

====  3.1 With Typst CLI

In your local system, just working like ` git clone ` , boostrap the template
using this command:



    typst init @preview/brilliant-cv:


Replace the ` <version> ` with the latest or any releases (after 2.0.0).

====  3.2 With ` utpm ` pakcage manager

[ utpm ](https://github.com/Thumuss/utpm) is a WIP packager manager for Typst.
Install it with official instructions.

Git clone then this repository on your local system, and within the workspace,
run ` utpm workspace link --force ` .

You will have to take care of templating by yourself, though.

===  4\. Compile Files

Adapt the ` metadata.toml ` to suit your needs, then ` typst c cv.typ ` to get
your first CV!

===  5\. Beyond

It is recommended to:

  1. Use ` git ` to manage your project, as it helps trace your changes and version control your CV.
  2. Use ` typstyle ` and ` pre-commit ` to help you format your CV.
  3. Use ` typos ` to check typos in your CV if your main locale is English.
  4. (Advanced) Use ` LTex ` in your favorite code editor to check grammars and get language suggestions.

==  How to upgrade version

For the time being, upgrade can be achieved by manually âfind and replaceâ
the import statements in batch in your favorite IDE. For example:



    #import "@preview/brilliant-cv:2.0.0" -> #import "@preview/brilliant-cv:2.0.3"


*Make sure you read the release notes to notice any breaking changes. We
estimate that there would still be some as Typst has not reached to a stable
release neither.*

==  Migration from ` v1 `

> The version ` v1 ` is now deprecated, due to the compliance to Typst
> Packages standard. However, if you want to continue to develop on the older
> version, please refer to the ` v1-legacy ` branch.

With an existing CV project using the ` v1 ` version of the template, a
migration is needed, including replacing some files / some content in certain
files.

  1. Delete ` brilliant-CV ` folder, ` .gitmodules ` . (Future package management will directly be managed by Typst)
  2. Migrate all the config on ` metadata.typ ` by creating a new ` metadata.toml ` . Follow the example toml file in the repo, it is rather straightforward to migrate.
  3. For ` cv.typ ` and ` letter.typ ` , copy the new files from the repo, and adapt the modules you have in your project.
  4. For the module files in ` /modules_* ` folders:
    1. Delete the old import ` #import "../brilliant-CV/template.typ": * ` , and replace it by the import statements in the new template files.
    2. Due to the Typst path handling mecanism, one cannot directly pass the path string to some functions anymore. This concerns, for example, the ` logo ` argument in ` cvEntry ` , but also on ` cvPublication ` as well. Some parameter names were changed, but most importantly, *you should pass a function instead of a string (i.e.` image("logo.png") ` instead of ` "logo.png" ` ). * Refer to new template files for reference.
  5. You might need to install ` Roboto ` and ` Source Sans Pro ` on your local system now, as new Typst package discourages including these large files.
  6. Run ` typst c cv.typ ` without passing the ` font-path ` flag. All should be good now, congrats!

Feel free to raise an issue for more assistance should you encounter a problem
that you cannot solve on your own :)

=  chronos

0.2.0

A package to draw sequence diagrams with CeTZ

A Typst package to draw sequence diagrams with CeTZ

- * *

This package lets you render sequence diagrams directly in Typst. The
following boilerplate code creates an empty sequence diagram with two
participants:

*Typst* |  *Result*
---|---


    #import "@preview/chronos:0.2.0"
    #chronos.diagram({
      import chronos: *
      _par("Alice")
      _par("Bob")
    })


|
![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/chronos/0.2.0/gallery/readme/boilerplate.png)

> _Disclaimer_
>  The package cannot parse PlantUML syntax for the moment, and thus requires
> the use of element functions, as shown in the examples. A PlantUML parser is
> in the TODO list, just not the top priority

==  Basic sequences

You can make basic sequences using the ` _seq ` function:

*Typst* |  *Result*
---|---


    #chronos.diagram({
      import chronos: *
      _par("Alice")
      _par("Bob")

      _seq("Alice", "Bob", comment: "Hello")
      _seq("Bob", "Bob", comment: "Think")
      _seq("Bob", "Alice", comment: "Hi")
    })


|
![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/chronos/0.2.0/gallery/readme/simple_sequence.png)

You can make lifelines using the following parameters of the ` _seq `
function:

  - ` enable-dst ` : enables the destination lifeline
  - ` create-dst ` : creates the destination lifeline and participant
  - ` disable-dst ` : disables the destination lifeline
  - ` destroy-dst ` : destroys the destination lifeline and participant
  - ` disable-src ` : disables the source lifeline
  - ` destroy-src ` : destroy the source lifeline and participant

*Typst* |  *Result*
---|---


    #chronos.diagram({
      import chronos: *
      _par("A", display-name: "Alice")
      _par("B", display-name: "Bob")
      _par("C", display-name: "Charlie")
      _par("D", display-name: "Derek")

      _seq("A", "B", comment: "hello", enable-dst: true)
      _seq("B", "B", comment: "self call", enable-dst: true)
      _seq("C", "B", comment: "hello from thread 2", enable-dst: true, lifeline-style: (fill: rgb("#005500")))
      _seq("B", "D", comment: "create", create-dst: true)
      _seq("B", "C", comment: "done in thread 2", disable-src: true, dashed: true)
      _seq("B", "B", comment: "rc", disable-src: true, dashed: true)
      _seq("B", "D", comment: "delete", destroy-dst: true)
      _seq("B", "A", comment: "success", disable-src: true, dashed: true)
    })

= *crudo.md*

=  crudo

0.1.1

Take slices from raw blocks

Crudo allows conveniently working with ` raw ` blocks in terms of individual
lines. It allows you to e.g.

  - filter lines by content
  - filter lines by range (slicing)
  - transform lines
  - join multiple raw blocks

While transforming the content, the original [ parameters
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/raw/#parameters) specified on the
given raw block will be preserved.

==  Getting Started

The full version of this example can be found in [ gallery/thumbnail.typ
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/crudo/0.1.1/gallery/thumbnail.typ)
.



    From

    #let preamble = ```typ
    #import "@preview/crudo:0.1.0"

    ```
    #preamble

    and

    #let example = ````typ
    #crudo.r2l(```c
    int main() {
      return 0;
    }
    ```)
    ````
    #example

    we get

    #let full-example = crudo.join(preamble, example)
    #full-example

    If you execute that, you get

    #eval(full-example.text, mode: "markup")


![Example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/crudo/0.1.1/thumbnail.png)

==  Usage

The template is now ready to be used, and can be called supplying the
following arguments. ` ? ` means the argument can be null if not applicable.

Argument  |  Default value  |  Type  |  Description
---|---|---|---
` titre ` |  ` none ` |  ` content? ` |  The title of your report.
` auteurs ` |  ` none ` |  ` array<str> | content? ` |  One or multiple authors to be credited in the report.
` groupe ` |  ` none ` |  ` content? ` |  Your class number/letter/identifier. Will be displayed right after the author(s).
` numero-tp ` |  ` none ` |  ` content? ` |  The number/identifier of the lab work/practical youâre writing this report for.
` numero-poste ` |  ` none ` |  ` content? ` |  Number of your lab bench.
` date ` |  ` none ` |  ` datetime | content? ` |  Date at which the lab work/practical was carried out.
` sommaire ` |  ` true ` |  ` bool ` |  Display the table of contents ?
` logo ` |  ` image("logo-insa-lyon.png") ` |  ` image? ` |  University logo to use.
` point-legende ` |  ` false ` |  ` bool ` |  Enable automatic enforcement of full stops at the end of figuresâ captions. (still somewhat experimental).

A single positional argument is accepted, being the reportâs body.

You can call the template using the following syntax :



    // Local import
    // #import "ttuile.typ": *

    // Universe import
    #import "@preview/ttuile:0.1.1": *

    #show: ttuile.with(
      titre: [Â« #lorem(8) Â»],
      auteurs: (
          "Theresa Tungsten",
          "Jean Dupont",
          "Eugene Deklan",
      ),
      groupe: "TD0",
      numero-tp: 0,
      numero-poste: "0",
      date: datetime.today(),
      // sommaire: false,
      // logo: image("path_to/logo.png"),
      // point-legende: true,
    )


==  ð Documentation

The package ` ttuile.typ ` exposes multiple functions, find out more about
them in the _documentation_ .

[ To the documentation ](https://github.com/vitto4/ttuile/blob/main/DOC.EN.md)

An example file is also available in [ ` template/main.typ `
](https://github.com/vitto4/ttuile/blob/main/template/main.typ)

==  ð Notes

  - Beware, all of the labels will be in french (authors != auteurs, appendix != annexe, â¦)

  - If you really want to use this template despite not being an INSA student, you can probably figure out what to change in the code (namely labels mentioned above). You can remove the INSA logo by setting ` logo: none `

Should you still need help, no worries, feel free to reach out !

  - The code - variable names and comments - is all in french. Thatâs on me, I didnât really think it through when first writing the template haha. I might consider translating sometime in the future.

  - The MIT license doesnât apply to the file ` logo-insa-lyon.png ` , it was retrieved from [ INSA Lyon - Ã©lÃ©ments graphiques ](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/fr/elements-graphiques) . It doesnât apply either to the âINSAâ branding.

==  ð§© Contributing

Contributions are welcome ! Parts of the template are very much spaghetti
code, especially where the spacing between different headings is handled
(seriously, itâs pretty bad).

If you know the proper way of doing this, an issue or PR would be greatly
appreciated :)

=  silky-letter-insa

0.2.2

A template made for letters and short documents of INSA, a French engineering
school.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=silky-letter-insa&version=0.2.2)

Typst Template for short documents and letters for the french engineering
school INSA.

==  Example

By default, the template initializes with the ` insa-letter ` show rule, with
parameters that you must fill in by yourself.

Here is an example of filled template:



    #import "@preview/silky-letter-insa:0.2.2": *
    #show: doc => insa-letter(
      author: "Youenn LE JEUNE, Kelian NINET",
      insa: "rennes"
      doc)

    #v(15pt)
    #align(center, text(size: 22pt, weight: "bold", smallcaps("ProbabilitÃ©s - Annale 2022 (V1)")))
    #v(5pt)

    #set heading(numbering: "1.")
    #show heading.where(level: 2): it => [
      #counter(heading).display()
      #text(weight: "medium", style: "italic", size: 13pt, it.body)

    ]

    = Intervalle de confiance
    == Calculer sur lâÃ©chantillon une estimation de la moyenne.
    $ overline(x_n) = 1/n sum_(i=1)^n x_i = 1885 $

    == Calculer sur lâÃ©chantillon une estimation de la variance.
    $
    "Variance biaisÃ©e :" s^2 &= 1/n sum_(i=1)^n (x_i - overline(x_n))^2 = 218^2\
    "Variance corrigÃ©e :" s'^2 &=  n/(n-1) s^2 = 231^2
    $

    Le bon estimateur est le second.

    == Ãcrire le code R permettant dâÃ©valuer les deux bornes de lâintervalle de confiance du temps dâexÃ©cution avec une confiance de 92%.
    Nous sommes dans le cas d'une recherche de moyenne avec variance inconnue, l'intervalle sera donc
    $ [overline(X) + t_(n-1)(alpha/2) S'/sqrt(n), quad overline(X) + t_(n-1)(1 - alpha/2) S'/sqrt(n)] $
    En R, avec l'Ã©chantillon nommÃ© `data`, Ã§a donne
    ```R
    data = c(1653, 2059, 2281, 1813, 2180, 1721, 1857, 1677, 1728)
    moyenne = mean(data)
    s_prime = sqrt(var(data)) # car la variance de R est dÃ©jÃ  corrigÃ©e
    n = 9
    alpha = 0.08

    IC_min = moyenne + qt(alpha / 2, df = n - 1) * s_prime / sqrt(n)
    IC_max = moyenne + qt(1 - alpha / 2, df = n - 1) * s_prime / sqrt(n)
    ```

    Ici on a $[1730, 2040]$.


==  Fonts

The graphic charter recommends the fonts *League Spartan* for headings and
*Source Serif* for regular text. To have the best look, you should install
those fonts.

To behave correctly on computers without those specific fonts installed, this
template will automatically fallback to other similar fonts:

  - *League Spartan* -> *Arial* (approved by INSAâs graphic charter, by default in Windows) -> *Liberation Sans* (by default in most Linux)
  - *Source Serif* -> *Source Serif 4* (downloadable for free) -> *Georgia* (approved by the graphic charter) -> *Linux Libertine* (default Typst font)

===  Note on variable fonts

If you want to install those fonts on your computer, Typst might not recognize
them if you install their _Variable_ versions. You should install the static
versions ( *League Spartan Bold* and most versions of *Source Serif* ).

Keep an eye on [ the issue in Typst bug tracker
](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/185) to see when variable fonts will
be used!

==  Notes

This template is being developed by Youenn LE JEUNE from the INSA de Rennes in
[ this repository ](https://github.com/SkytAsul/INSA-Typst-Template) .

For now it includes assets from the graphic charters of those INSAs:

  - Rennes ( ` rennes ` )
  - Hauts de France ( ` hdf ` )
  - Centre Val de Loire ( ` cvl ` ) Users from other INSAs can open a pull request on the repository with the assets for their INSA.

If you have any other feature request, open an issue on the repository as
well.

==  License

The typst template is licensed under the [ MIT license
](https://github.com/SkytAsul/INSA-Typst-Template/blob/main/LICENSE) . This
does _not_ apply to the image assets. Those image files are property of Groupe
INSA.

==  Changelog

===  0.2.2

  - Added INSA CVL assets

===  0.2.1

  - Added ` insa ` option
  - Added INSA HdF assets

![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/cmarker/0.1.1/examples/simple.png)

This document is available in [ Markdown
](https://github.com/SabrinaJewson/cmarker.typ/tree/main#cmarker) and [
rendered PDF
](https://github.com/SabrinaJewson/cmarker.typ/blob/main/README.pdf) formats.

==  API

We offer a single function:



    render(
      markdown,
      smart-punctuation: true,
      blockquote: none,
      math: none,
      h1-level: 1,
      raw-typst: true,
      scope: (:),
      show-source: false,
    ) -> content


The parameters are as follows:

  - ` markdown ` : The [ CommonMark ](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/) Markdown string to be processed. Parsed with the [ pulldown-cmark ](https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark) Rust library. You can set this to ` read("somefile.md") ` to import an external markdown file; see the [ documentation for the read function ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/data-loading/read/) .

    - Accepted values: Strings and raw text code blocks.
    - Required.
  - ` smart-punctuation ` : Automatically convert ASCII punctuation to Unicode equivalents:

    - nondirectional quotations (" and ') become directional (ââ and ââ);
    - three consecutive full stops (â¦) become ellipses (â¦);
    - two and three consecutive hypen-minus signs (-- and â) become en and em dashes (â and â).

Note that although Typst also offers this functionality, this conversion is
done through the Markdown parser rather than Typst.

    - Accepted values: Booleans.
    - Default value: ` true ` .
  - ` blockquote ` : A callback to be used when a blockquote is encountered in the Markdown, or ` none ` if blockquotes should be treated as normal text. Because Typst does not support blockquotes natively, the user must configure this.

    - Accepted values: Functions accepting content and returning content, or ` none ` .
    - Default value: ` none ` .

For example, to display a black border to the left of the text one can use:


        box.with(stroke: (left: 1pt + black), inset: (left: 5pt, y: 6pt))


  - ` math ` : A callback to be used when equations are encountered in the Markdown, or ` none ` if it should be treated as normal text. Because Typst does not support LaTeX equations natively, the user must configure this.

    - Accepted values: Functions that take a boolean argument named ` block ` and a positional string argument (often, the ` mitex ` function from [ the mitex package ](https://typst.app/universe/package/mitex) ), or ` none ` .
    - Default value: ` none ` .

For example, to render math equation as a Typst math block, one can use:


        #import "@preview/mitex:0.2.4": mitex
    #cmarker.render(`$\int_1^2 x \mathrm{d} x$`, math: mitex)


  - ` h1-level ` : The level that top-level headings in Markdown should get in Typst. When set to zero, top-level headings are treated as text, ` ## ` headings become ` = ` headings, ` ### ` headings become ` == ` headings, et cetera; when set to ` 2 ` , ` # ` headings become ` == ` headings, ` ## ` headings become ` === ` headings, et cetera.

    - Accepted values: Integers in the range [0, 255].
    - Default value: 1.
  - ` raw-typst ` : Whether to allow raw Typst code to be injected into the document via HTML comments. If disabled, the comments will act as regular HTML comments.

    - Accepted values: Booleans.
    - Default value: ` true ` .

For example, when this is enabled, ` <!--raw-typst #circle(radius: 10pt) --> `
will result in a circle in the document (but only when rendered through
Typst). See also ` <!--typst-begin-exclude--> ` and ` <!--typst-end-exclude-->
` , which is the inverse of this.

  - ` scope ` : When ` raw-typst ` is enabled, this is a dictionary providing the context in which the evaluated Typst code runs. It is useful to pass values in to code inside ` <!--raw-typst--> ` blocks.

    - Accepted values: Any dictionary.
    - Default value: ` (:) ` .
  - ` show-source ` : A debugging tool. When set to ` true ` , the Typst code that would otherwise have been displayed will be instead rendered in a code block.

    - Accepted values: Booleans.
    - Default value: ` false ` .

This function returns the rendered ` content ` .

==  Supported Markdown Syntax

We support CommonMark with a couple extensions.

  - Paragraph breaks: Two newlines, i.e. one blank line.
  - Hard line breaks (used more in poetry than prose): Put two spaces at the end of the line.
  - ` _emphasis_ ` or ` _emphasis_ ` : _emphasis_
  - ` *strong* ` or ` __strong__ ` : *strong*
  - ` ~strikethrough~ ` : ~strikethrough~
  - ` [links](https://example.org) ` : [ links ](https://example.org/)
  - ` ### Headings ` , where ` # ` is a top-level heading, ` ## ` a subheading, ` ### ` a sub-subheading, etc
  - ` `inline code blocks` ` : ` inline code blocks `
  *     ```
    out of line code blocks
    ```


Syntax highlighting can be achieved by specifying a language after the opening
backticks:


        ```rust
    let x = 5;
    ```


giving:


        let x = 5;


  - ` --- ` , making a horizontal rule:

- * *

  *     - Unordered
    - lists


    - Unordered
    - Lists
  *     1. Ordered
    1. Lists


    1. Ordered
    2. Lists
  - ` $x + y$ ` or ` $$x + y$$ ` : math equations, if the ` math ` parameter is set.
  - ` > blockquotes ` , if the ` blockquote ` parameter is set.
  - Images: ` ![Some tiled hexagons](examples/hexagons.png) ` , giving ![Some tiled hexagons](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/cmarker/0.1.1/examples/hexagons.png)

==  Interleaving Markdown and Typst

Sometimes, you might want to render a certain section of the document only
when viewed as Markdown, or only when viewed through Typst. To achieve the
former, you can simply wrap the section in ` <!--typst-begin-exclude--> ` and
` <!--typst-end-exclude--> ` :



    Hello from not Typst!



Most Markdown parsers support HTML comments, so from their perspective this is
no different to just writing out the Markdown directly; but ` cmarker.typ `
knows to search for those comments and avoid rendering the content in between.

Note that when the opening comment is followed by the end of an element, `
cmarker.typ ` will close the block for you. For example:



    >
    > One

    Two


In this code, âTwoâ will be given no matter where the document is
rendered. This is done to prevent us from generating invalid Typst code.

Conversely, one can put Typst code inside a HTML comment of the form ` <!--
raw-typst [â¦]--> ` to have it evaluated directly as Typst code (but only if
the ` raw-typst ` option to ` render ` is set to ` true ` , otherwise it will
just be seen as a regular comment and removed):





==  MarkdownâTypst Polyglots

This project has a manual as a PDF and a README as a Markdown document, but by
the power of this library they are in fact the same thing! Furthermore, one
can read the ` README.md ` in a markdown viewer and it will display correctly,
but one can _also_ run ` typst compile README.md ` to generate the Typst-
typeset ` README.pdf ` .

How does this work? We just have to be clever about how we write the README:



    (Typst preamble content)
    #"


    Regular Markdown goes hereâ¦




The same code but syntax-highlighted as Typst code helps to illuminate it:



    <picture>
    (Typst preamble content)
    #"</picture>
    <!--".slice(0,0)
    #import "@preview/cmarker:0.1.1"
    #let markdown = read("README.md")
    #markdown = markdown.slice(markdown.position("</picture>") + "</picture>".len())
    #cmarker.render(markdown, h1-level: 0)
    /_-->

    Regular Markdown goes hereâ¦

    <!--_///-->


==  Limitations

  - We do not currently support HTML tags, and they will be stripped from the output; for example, GitHub supports writing ` <sub>text</sub> ` to get subscript text, but we will render that as simply âtextâ. In future it would be nice to support a subset of HTML tags.
  - We do not currently support Markdown tables and footnotes. In future it would be good to.
  - Although I tried my best to escape everything correctly, I wonât provide a hard guarantee that everything is fully sandboxed even if you set ` raw-typst: false ` . That said, Typst itself is well-sandboxed anyway.

==  Development

  - Build the plugin with ` ./build.sh ` , which produces the ` plugin.wasm ` necessary to use this.
  - Compile examples with ` typst compile examples/{name}.typ --root . ` .
  - Compile this README to PDF with ` typst compile README.md ` .

= *equate.md*

=  equate

0.2.1

Breakable equations with improved numbering.

Featured  Package

A package for improved layout of equations and mathematical expressions.

When applied, this package will split up multi-line block equations into
multiple elements, so that each line can be assigned a separate number. By
default, the equation counter is incremented for each line, but this behavior
can be changed by setting the ` sub-numbering ` argument to ` true ` . In this
case, the equation counter will only be incremented once for the entire block,
and each line will be assigned a sub-number like ` 1a ` , ` 2.1 ` , or
similar, depending on the set equation numbering. You can also set the `
number-mode ` argument to ` "label" ` to only number labelled lines. If a
label is only applied to the full equation, all lines will be numbered.

This splitting also makes it possible to spread equations over page boundaries
while keeping alignment in place, which can be useful for long derivations or
proofs. This can be configured by the ` breakable ` parameter of the ` equate
` function, or by setting the ` breakable ` parameter of ` block ` for
equations via a show-set rule. Additionally, the alignment of the equation
number is improved, so that it always matches the baseline of the equation.

If you want to create a âstandardâ equation with a single equation number
centered across all lines, you can attach the ` <equate:revoke> ` label to the
equation. This will disable the effect of this package for the current
equation. This label can also be used in single lines of an equation to
disable numbering for that line only.

==  Usage

The package comes with a single ` equate ` function that is supposed to be
used as a template. It takes two optional arguments for customization:

Argument  |  Type  |  Description  |  Default
---|---|---|---
` breakable ` |  ` boolean ` , ` auto ` |  Whether to allow the equation to break across pages.  |  ` auto `
` sub-numbering ` |  ` boolean ` |  Whether to assign sub-numbers to each line of an equation.  |  ` false `
` number-mode ` |  ` "line" ` , ` "label" ` |  Whether to number all lines or only those with a label.  |  ` "line" `

To reference a specific line of an equation, include the label at the end of
the line, like in the following example:



    #import "@preview/equate:0.2.1": equate

    #show: equate.with(breakable: true, sub-numbering: true)
    #set math.equation(numbering: "(1.1)")

    The dot product of two vectors $arrow(a)$ and $arrow(b)$ can
    be calculated as shown in @dot-product.

    $
      angle.l a, b angle.r &= arrow(a) dot arrow(b) \
                           &= a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + ... a_n b_n \
                           &= sum_(i=1)^n a_i b_i. #<sum>
    $ <dot-product>

    The sum notation in @sum is a useful way to express the dot
    product of two vectors.

![Result of example code \(page
2\).](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/equate/0.2.1/assets/example-2.svg)

===  Local Usage

If you only want to use the package features on selected equations, you can
also apply the ` equate ` function directly to the equation. This will
override the default behavior for the current equation only. Note, that this
will require you to use the ` equate ` function as a show rule for references,
as shown in the following example:



    #import "@preview/equate:0.2.1": equate

    // Allow references to a line of the equation.
    #show ref: equate

    #set math.equation(numbering: "(1.1)", supplement: "Eq.")

    #equate($
      E &= m c^2 #<short> \
        &= sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4) #<long>
    $)

    While @short is the famous equation by Einstein, @long is a
    more general form of the energy-momentum relation.


![Result of example
code.](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/equate/0.2.1/assets/example-
local.svg)

As an alternative to the show rule, it is also possible to manually wrap each
reference in an ` equate ` function, though this is less convenient and more
prone to mistakes.

=  titleize

0.1.1

Turn strings into title case

Small wrapper around the [ titlecase ](https://crates.io/crates/titlecase)
library to convert text to title case. It follows the [ rules defined by John
Gruber ](https://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case) . For more details,
refer to the library.

` titlecase ` applies a show rule, that by default transforms every string of
at least four characters. This limit can be changed with the ` limit `
parameter. Especially with equations, the results can be a bit unpredictable,
so proceed with care.



    #import "@preview/titleize:0.1.1": titlecase

    #for s in (
      "Being productive on linux",
      "Finding an alternative to Mac OS X â part 2",
      [an example with small words and sub-phrases: "the example"],
    ) [
      #s => #titlecase(s) \
    ]

    #let debug-print(x) = {
      if type(x) == content {
        let fields = x.fields()
        let func = x.func()
        [
          #repr(func)
          #for (k, v) in fields [
            - #k: #debug-print(v)
          ]
        ]
      } else {

          array
          #for y in x [

        ] else [
          #repr(type(x)) (#repr(x))
        ]
      }
    }

    #show: titlecase

    = This is a test, even with math $a = b + c$

    In math, text can appear in various places:

1.0.1

A no-frills curriculum vitae (CV) template using Typst and YAML to version
control CV data.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=imprecv&version=1.0.1)

[ ![Apache-2
License](https://img.shields.io/badge/Star%20Repo-%E2%AD%90-1081c2.svg)

[ ![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/jskherman/imprecv)
](https://github.com/jskherman/imprecv/releases)

` imprecv ` is a no-frills curriculum vitae (CV) template for [ Typst
](https://github.com/typst/typst) that uses a YAML file for data input in
order to version control CV data easily.

This is based on the [ popular template on Reddit
](https://web.archive.org/https://old.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/)
by [ u/SheetsGiggles
](https://web.archive.org/https://old.reddit.com/user/SheetsGiggles) and the
recommendations of the [ r/EngineeringResumes wiki
](https://web.archive.org/https://old.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/m2cc65/new_and_improved_wiki)
.

==  Demo

See [ *example CV*
](https://github.com/jskherman/imprecv/releases/latest/download/example.pdf)
and [ @jskhermanâs CV ](https://go.jskherman.com/cv) :

![Sample CV Page

![Sample CV Page
2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jskherman/imprecv/main/assets/thumbnail.2.png)

==  Usage

This ` imprecv ` is intended to be used by importing the templateâs [
package entrypoint
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/imprecv/1.0.1/cv.typ)
from a âcontentâ file (see [ ` template.typ `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/imprecv/1.0.1/template/template.typ)
as an example). In this content file, call the functions which apply document
styles, show CV components, and load CV data from a YAML file (see [ `
template.yml `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/imprecv/1.0.1/template/template.yml)
as an example). Inside the content file you can modify several style variables
and even override existing function implementations to your own needs and
preferences.

===  With the [ Typst CLI ](https://github.com/typst/typst)

The recommended usage with the Typst CLI is by running the command ` typst
init @preview/imprecv:1.0.1 ` in your project directory. This will create a
new Typst project with the ` imprecv ` template and the necessary files to get
started. You can then run ` typst compile template.typ ` to compile your file
to PDF.

Take a look at the [ example setup ](https://github.com/jskherman/cv.typ-
example-repo) for ideas on how to get started. It includes a GitHub action
workflow to compile the Typst files to PDF and upload it to Cloudflare R2.

===  With [ typst.app ](https://typst.app/)

From the Dashboard, select âStart from templateâ, search and choose the `
imprecv ` template. From there, decide on a name for your project and click
âCreateâ. You can now edit the template files and preview the result on
the right.

You can also click the ` Create project in app ` button in [ Typst Universe
](https://typst.app/universe/package/imprecv) to create a new project with the
` imprecv ` template.

==  Contributing

[ Iâm ](https://github.com/jskherman) only doing programming as a hobby so
it might take me a while to respond to issues and pull requests. If you would
like to contribute to this project, I would be happy to review your pull
requests when I can. Thank you for your understanding.

= *funarray.md*

=  funarray

0.4.0

Package providing convenient functional functions to use on arrays.

This package provides some convinient functional functions for [ typst
](https://typst.app/) to use on arrays.

==  Usage

To use this package simply ` #import "@preview/funarray:0.3.0" ` . To import
all functions use ` : * ` and for specific ones, use either the module or as
described in the [ typst docs
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/scripting#modules) .

==  Important note

Almost all functions are one-liners, which could, instead of being loaded via
a package import, also be just copied directly into your source files.

==  Dokumentation

A prettier und easier to read version of the documentation exists in the
example folder, which is done in typst and exported to pdf. Otherwise, bellow
is the markdown version.

==  Functions

Let us define ` a = (1, "not prime", 2, "prime", 3, "prime", 4, "not prime",
5, "prime") `

===  chunks

The chunks function translates the array to an array of array. It groups the
elements to chunks of a given size and collects them in an bigger array.

` chunks(a, 2) = ( (1, "not prime"), (2, "prime"), (3, "prime"), (4, "not
prime"), (5, "prime") ) `

===  unzip

The unzip function is the inverse of the zip method, it transforms an array of
pairs to a pair of vectors. You can also give input an array of ` n ` -tuples
resulting in in ` n ` arrays.

` unzip(b) = ( (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), ( "not prime", "prime", "prime", "not prime",
"prime" ) ) `

===  cycle

The cycle function concatenates the array to itself until it has a given size.



    let c = cycle(range(5), 8)
    c = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2)


Note that there is also the functionality to concatenate with ` + ` and ` * `
in typst.

===  windows and circular-windows

This function provides a running window

` windows(c, 5) = ( (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3, 4, 0), (2, 3, 4, 0, 1), (3, 4,
0, 1, 2) ) `

whereas the circular version wraps over.

` circular-windows(c, 5) = ( (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3, 4, 0), (2, 3, 4, 0,
1), (3, 4, 0, 1, 2), (4, 0, 1, 2, 4), (0, 1, 2, 4, 0), (1, 2, 4, 0, 1), (2, 4,
0, 1, 2) ) `

===  partition and partition-map

The partition function seperates the array in two according to a predicate
function. The result is an array with all elements, where the predicate
returned true followed by an array with all elements, where the predicate
returned false.



    let (primesp, nonprimesp) = partition(b, x => x.at(1) == "prime")
    primesp = ((2, "prime"), (3, "prime"), (5, "prime"))
    nonprimesp = ((1, "not prime"), (4, "not prime"))


There is also a partition-map function, which after partition also applies a
second function on both collections.



    let (primes, nonprimes) = partition-map(b, x => x.at(1) == "prime", x => x.at(0))
    primes = (2, 3, 5)
    nonprimes = (1, 4)


===  group-by

This functions groups according to a predicate into maximally sized chunks,
where all elements have the same predicate value.



    let f = (0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1)
    let g = group-by(f, x => x == 0)
    g = ((0, 0), (1, 1, 1), (0, 0), (1,))


===  flatten

Typst has a ` flatten ` method for arrays, however that method acts
recursively. For instance

` (((1,2,3), (2,3)), ((1,2,3), (1,2))).flatten() = (1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1,
2) `

Normally, one would only have flattened one level. To do this, we can use the
typst array concatenation method +, or by folding, the sum method for arrays:

` (((1,2,3), (2,3)), ((1,2,3), (1,2))).sum() = ((1, 2, 3), (2, 3), (1, 2, 3),
(1, 2)) `

To handle further depth, one can use flatten again, so that in our example:

` (((1,2,3), (2,3)), ((1,2,3), (1,2))).sum().sum() = (((1,2,3), (2,3)),
((1,2,3), (1,2))).flatten() `

===  intersperse

This function has been removed in version 0.3, as typst 0.8 provides such
functionality by default.

===  take-while and skip-while

These functions do exactly as they say.



    take-while(h, x => x < 1) = (0, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75)
    skip-while(h, x => x < 1) = (1, 1, 1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)


==  Unsafe Functions

The core functions are defined in ` funarray-unsafe.typ ` . However,
assertions (error checking) are not there and it is generally not being
advised to use these directly. Still, if being cautious, one can use the
imported ` funarray-unsafe ` module in ` funarray(.typ) ` . All function names
are the same.

To do this from the package, do as follows:



    #import @preview/funarray:0.3.0

    #funarray.funarray-unsafe.chunks(range(10), 3)


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` funarray `



    #import "@preview/funarray:0.4.0"

0.3.0

Create beautiful booklets with ease.

Create beautiful booklets with ease.

The current version of this library (0.3.0) contains a single function to take
in an array of content blocks and order them into a ready to print booklet,
bulletin, etc. No need to fight with printer settings or document converters.

===  Example Output

Here is an example of the output generated by the ` sig ` function (short for
a bookâs signature) with default parameters and some sample content:

![Example1](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/bookletic/0.3.0/example/basic.png)

Here is an example with some customization applied:

![Example2](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/bookletic/0.3.0/example/fancy.png)

==  ` sig ` Function

The ` sig ` function is used to create a signature (booklet) layout from
provided content. It takes various parameters to automatically configure the
layout.

===  Parameters

  - ` page_margin_binding ` : The binding margin for each page in the booklet (space between pages).
  - ` page_border ` : Takes a color space value to draw a border around each page. If set to none no border will be drawn.
  - ` draft ` : A boolean value indicating whether to output an unordered draft or final layout.
  - ` p-num-layout ` : A configuration for page numbering styles, allowing multiple layouts that apply to specified page ranges. Each layout can be provided as a dictonary specifying the following options:
    - ` p-num-start ` : Starting page number for this layout
    - ` p-num-alt-start ` : Alternative starting page number (e.g., for chapters)
    - ` p-num-pattern ` : Pattern for page numbering (e.g., ` "1" ` , ` "i" ` , ` "a" ` , ` "A" ` )
    - ` p-num-placment ` : Placement of page numbers ( ` top ` or ` bottom ` )
    - ` p-num-align-horizontal ` : Horizontal alignment of page numbers ( ` left ` , ` center ` , or ` right ` )
    - ` p-num-align-vertical ` : Vertical alignment of page numbers ( ` top ` , ` horizon ` , or ` bottom ` )
    - ` p-num-pad-left ` : Extra padding added to the left of the page number
    - ` p-num-pad-horizontal ` : Horizontal padding for page numbers
    - ` p-num-size ` : Size of page numbers
    - ` p-num-border ` : The border color for the page numbers. If set to none no border will be drawn.
    - ` p-num-halign-alternate ` : A boolean for whether to alternate horizontal alignment between left and right pages.
  - ` pad_content ` : The padding around the page content.
  - ` contents ` : The content to be laid out in the booklet. This should be an array of blocks.

===  Usage

To use the ` sig ` function, first set your desired page settings using the
native page function. Then simply call the sig function with the desired
parameters and provide the content to be laid out in the booklet:



    #set page(flipped: true, paper: "us-letter")
    #bookletic.sig(
      contents: [
        ["Page 1 content"],
        ["Page 2 content"],
        ["Page 3 content"],
        ["Page 4 content"],
      ],
    )


This will create a signature layout with the provided content, using the
default values for the other parameters.

You can customize the layout by passing different values for the various
parameters. For example:



    #set page(flipped: true, paper: "us-legal", margin: (top: 1in, bottom: 1in, left: 1in, right: 1in))
    #bookletic.sig(
      page_margin_binding: 0.5in,
      page_border: none,
      draft: true,
      p-num-layout: (
        bookletic.num-layout(
          p-num-start: 1,
          p-num-alt-start: none,
          p-num-pattern: "~ 1 ~",
          p-num-placment: bottom,
          p-num-align-horizontal: right,
          p-num-align-vertical: horizon,
          p-num-pad-left: -5pt,
          p-num-pad-horizontal: 0pt,
          p-num-size: 16pt,
          p-num-border: rgb("#ff4136"),
          p-num-halign-alternate: false,
        ),
      ),
      pad_content: 10pt,
      contents: (
        ["Page 1 content"],
        ["Page 2 content"],
        ["Page 3 content"],
        ["Page 4 content"],
      ),
    )


This will create an unordered draft signature layout with US Legal paper size,
larger margins, no page borders, page numbers at the bottom right corner with
a red border, and more padding around the content.

===  Notes

  - The ` sig ` function is currently hardcoded to only handle two-page single-fold signatures. Other more complicated signatures may be supported in the future.
  - The ` num-layout ` function is a helper to create page number layouts with default values.
  - The ` booklet ` function is a placeholder for automatically breaking a single content block into pages dynamically. It is not implemented yet but will be added in coming versions.

==  Collaboration

I would love to see this package eventually turn into a community effort. So
any interest in collaboration is very welcome! You can find the github
repository for this library here: [ Bookletic Repo
](https://github.com/harrellbm/Bookletic) . Feel free to file an issue, pull
request, or start a discussion.

==  Changlog

====  0.3.0

  - Remove internal dependency on native page function. This allows the user to set the page function separately with full control over paper type, outer margins and everything else defined by the native page function.
  - Add p-num-halign-alternate to page number layout allowing setting page numbers to alternate on facing pages making it possible to place page numbers along the outside or inside edges of facing pages.
  - Internal improvements for ordering algorithm.
  - Add ` num-layout ` function helper.

====  0.2.0

  - Handle odd number of pages by inserting a blank back cover
  - Implements page number layouts to allow defining different page numbers for different page ranges.
  - Add various other page number options

====  0.1.0

![A preview of the basic-resume Typst
template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/basic-
resume-0.2.0-small.webp)

=  basic-resume

0.2.0

A simple, standard resume, designed to work well with ATS.

Featured  Template

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=basic-resume&version=0.2.0)

Version 0.2.0

This is a template for a simple resume. It is intended to be used as a good
starting point for quickly crafting a standard resume that will properly be
parsed by ATS systems. Inspiration is taken from [ Jakeâs Resume
](https://github.com/jakegut/resume) and [ guided-resume-starter-cgc
](https://typst.app/universe/package/guided-resume-starter-cgc/) . Iâm
currently a college student and was unable to find a Typst resume template
that fit my needs, so I wrote my own. I hope this template can be useful to
others as well.

==  Sample Resume

![example resume](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stuxf/basic-typst-resume-
template/main/example-resume.png)

==  Quick Start

A barebones resume looks like this, which you can use to get started.



    #import "@preview/basic-resume:0.2.0": *

    // Put your personal information here, replacing mine
    #let name = "Stephen Xu"
    #let location = "San Diego, CA"
    #let email = "stxu@hmc.edu"
    #let github = "github.com/stuxf"
    #let linkedin = "linkedin.com/in/stuxf"
    #let phone = "+1 (xxx) xxx-xxxx"
    #let personal-site = "stuxf.dev"

    #show: resume.with(
      author: name,
      // All the lines below are optional.
      // For example, if you want to to hide your phone number:
      // feel free to comment those lines out and they will not show.
      location: location,
      email: email,
      github: github,
      linkedin: linkedin,
      phone: phone,
      personal-site: personal-site,
      accent-color: "#26428b",
      font: "New Computer Modern",
    )

    /*
    - Lines that start with == are formatted into section headings
    - You can use the specific formatting functions if needed
    - The following formatting functions are listed below
    - #edu(dates: "", degree: "", gpa: "", institution: "", location: "")

= *shiroa.md*

=  shiroa

0.1.2

A simple tool for creating modern online books in pure typst.

[ _shiroa_ ](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/shiroa) ( _Shiro A_ , or _The
White_ , or _äºç¬º_ ) is a simple tool for creating modern online (cloud)
books in pure typst.

==  Installation (shiroa CLI)

There are multiple ways to install the [ shiroa ](https://github.com/Myriad-
Dreamin/shiroa) CLI tool. Choose any one of the methods below that best suit
your needs.

===  Pre-compiled binaries

Executable binaries are available for download on the [ GitHub Releases page
](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/shiroa/releases) . Download the binary for
your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and extract the archive. The archive
contains an ` shiroa ` executable which you can run to build your books.

To make it easier to run, put the path to the binary into your ` PATH ` .

===  Build from source using Rust

To build the ` shiroa ` executable from source, you will first need to install
Yarn, Rust, and Cargo. Follow the instructions on the [ Yarn installation page
](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and [ Rust installation page
](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) . shiroa currently requires at
least Rust version 1.75.

To build with precompiled artifacts, run the following commands:



    cargo install --git https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/shiroa --locked shiroa-cli


To build from source, run the following commands:



    git clone https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/shiroa.git
    git submodule update --recursive --init
    cargo run --bin shiroa-build
    # optional: install it globally
    cargo install --path ./cli


With global installation, to uninstall, run the command ` cargo uninstall
shiroa ` .

Again, make sure to add the Cargo bin directory to your ` PATH ` .

===  Get started

See the [ Get-started ](https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/shiroa/guide/get-
started.html) online documentation.

===  Setup for writing your book

We donât provide a watch command, but ` shiroa ` is designated to embracing
all of the approaches to writing typst documents. Itâs feasible to preview
your documents by following approaches (like previewing normal documents):

  - via [ Official Web App ](https://typst.app/) .

  - via VSCod(e,ium), see [ Tinymist ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) and [ Typst Preview ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgt19937.typst-preview) .

  - via other editors. For example of neovim, see [ typst.vim ](https://github.com/kaarmu/typst.vim) and [ Typst Preview ](https://github.com/Enter-tainer/typst-preview#use-without-vscode) .

  - via ` typst-cli watch ` , See [ typst-cli watch ](https://github.com/typst/typst#usage) .

===  Acknowledgement

  - The [ mdbook theme ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/shiroa/0.1.2/themes/mdbook/) is borrowed from [ mdBook ](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/tree/master/src/theme) project.

  - Compile the document with awesome [ Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) .

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` shiroa `



    #import "@preview/shiroa:0.1.2"

=  badformer

0.1.0

Retro-gaming in Typst. Reach the goal and complete the mission.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=badformer&version=0.1.0)

Reach the goal in this retro-inspired wireframing platformer. Play in 3
dimensions and compete for the lowest number of steps to win!

This small game is playable in the Typst editor and best enjoyed with the web
app or ` typst watch ` . It was first released for the 24 Days to Christmas
campaign in winter of 2023.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` badformer ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/badformer


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

Move with WASD and jump with space. You can also display a minimap by pressing
E.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` game ` function, which accepts a positional
argument for the game input.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` game `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/badformer:0.1.0": game
    #show: game(read("main.typ"))

    // Move with WASD and jump with space.

=  uo-pup-thesis-manuscript

0.1.0

Unofficial Typst template for PUP (Polytechnic University of the Philippines)
undergraduate thesis manuscript

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=uo-pup-thesis-
manuscript&version=0.1.0)

Unofficial [ typst ](https://typst.app/) template for undergraduate thesis
manuscript for PUP (Polytechnic University of the Philippines). This template
adheres to the Universityâs Thesis and Dissertation Manual as of 2017 (ISBN:
978-971â95208-8-7 (Online)). An example manuscript is also provided (see `
./thesis.pdf ` ).

==  Setup

Using [ Typst CLI ](https://github.com/typst/typst?tab=readme-ov-
file#installation) :



    typst init @preview/uo-pup-thesis-manuscript my-thesis
    cd my-thesis
    typst compile thesis.typ  # to compile to PDF


or run



    typst watch thesis.typ  # to automatically compiles PDF on save


==  Usage

The template already provided an example structure and some guides. But to
start from nothing, make an entrypoint file with a basic structure like this:



    // thesis.typ
    #import "@preview/uo-pup-thesis-manuscript:0.1.0": *


    #show: template.with(
      [<your thesis title here>],
      ("Author 1", "Author 2", ..., "Author N"),
      "name of your college here",
      "name of your deg. program here",
      "Month YYYY"
    )


    // Main content starts here

    // This provides a customized heading for
    // chapters that follows the manual
    #chapter(1, "Chapter 1 Title")

    // Since #chapter() provides a heading level 1,
    // start each headings under chapters with level 2
    // to avoid messing up the generated Table of Contents
    == Introduction

    ...

    #chapter(2, "Chapter 2 Title")

    == Topic A

    ...

    // End of main content


    // Bibliography formatting setup
    #set par(first-line-indent: 0pt, hanging-indent: 0.5in)
    #set page(header: context [#h(1fr) #counter(page).get().first()])
    #align(center)[ #heading("REFERENCES") ]
    #set par(spacing: 1.5em)

    // Get the apa.csl file from `template/` folder
    #bibliography(title: none, style: "./apa.csl", "path/to/your/bibtex/file.bib")


    // Appendices
    #show: appendices-section

    #appendix(1, "Appendix Title")

    ...

    #pagebreak()

    #appendix(2, "Appendix Title")

    ...


There are also provided utilities for some parts that have a specific way of
formatting.

For example, in ` Definition of Terms ` and ` Significance of the Study `
sections, use ` #description ` function:



    == Significance of the Study
    #description(
      (
        (term: [Topic A], desc: [#lorem(30)]),
        (term: [Topic B], desc: [#lorem(30)]),
        (term: [Topic C], desc: [#lorem(30)]),
      )
    )

    ...

    == Definition of Terms
    #description(
      (
        (term: [Topic A], desc: [#lorem(30)]),
        (term: [Topic B], desc: [#lorem(30)]),
      )
    )

If thereâs any mistakes, wrong formatting (e.g., not actually following the
manual), etc., file an issue or a pull request.

= *iconic-salmon-fa.md*

=  iconic-salmon-fa

1.0.0

A Typst library for Social Media references with icons based on Font Awesome.

The ` iconic-salmon-fa ` package is designed to help you create your
curriculum vitae (CV). It allows you to easily reference your social media
profiles with the typical icon of the service plus a link to your profile.
The package name is a combination of the acronym _SociAL Media icONs_ and the
word _iconic_ because all these icons have an iconic design (and iconic also
contains the word _icon_ ).

==  Features

  - Support for popular social media, developer and career platforms
  - Uniform design for all entries
  - Based on the Internetâs icon library [ Font Awesome ](https://fontawesome.com/)
  - Easy to use
  - Allows the customization of the look (extra args are passed to [ ` text ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/) )

==  Fonts Installation

===  Linux

  1. [ Download Font Awesome for Desktop ](https://fontawesome.com/download)
  2. Unzip the file
  3. Switch into the ` otfs ` folder within the unzipped folder
  4. Run ` mkdir -p /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ `
  5. Run ` install -m644 'Font Awesome 6 Brands-Regular-400.otf' /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ `
  6. Unfortunately not all brands are included in the brands font file, so you must also run ` install -m644 'Font Awesome 6 Free-Regular-400.otf' /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ `

==  Usage

===  Using Typstâs package manager

You can install the library using the [ typst packages
](https://github.com/typst/packages) :



    #import "@preview/iconic-salmon-fa:1.0.0": *


===  Install manually

Put the ` iconic-salmon-fa.typ ` file in your project directory and import it:



    #import "iconic-salmon-fa.typ": *


===  Minimal Example



    // #import "@preview/iconic-salmon-fa:1.0.0": github-info, gitlab-info
    #import "iconic-salmon-fa.typ": github-info, gitlab-info

    This project was created by #github-info("Bi0T1N"). You can also find me on #gitlab-info("GitLab", rgb("#811052"), url: "https://gitlab.com/Bi0T1N").


===  Examples

See the [ ` examples.typ `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/iconic-salmon-
fa/1.0.0/examples/examples.typ) file for a complete example. The [ generated
PDF files
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/iconic-salmon-
fa/1.0.0/examples/) are also available for preview.

=  ofbnote

0.2.0

A document template using French Office for biodiversity design guidelines

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=ofbnote&version=0.2.0)

This is a Typst template to help formatting documents according to the French
office for biodiversity design guidelines.

==  Usage

You can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/ofbnote


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` ofbnote ` function with one named argument called
` meta ` which should be a dictionary of metadata for the document. The ` meta
` dictionary can contain the following fields:

  - ` title ` : The documentâs title as a string or content.
  - ` authors ` : The documentâs author(s) as a string.
  - ` date ` : The documentâs date as a string or content.
  - ` version ` : The documentâs version as a string.

It may contains other values, but they have no effect on the final document.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
paper.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` ofbnote
` function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use
this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/ofbnote:0.2.0": *

    #show: ofbnote.with( meta:(
      title: "My note",
      authors: "Me",
      date: "March 23rd, 2023",
      version: "1.0"

2.0.0

A guided starter resume for people looking to focus on highlighting their
experience -- without having to worry about the hassle of formatting.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=guided-resume-starter-
cgc&version=2.0.0)

This template is a starter resume for people looking to focus on the content
of their resume, without having to worry about the hassle of formatting.

==  Get Started!

===  Quickstart: Typst Universe

  1. If you havenât already, [ create a (free!) Typst account ](https://typst.app/) .
  2. Once you have an account, go to the template on [ Typst Universe ](https://typst.app/universe/package/resume-starter-cgc)
  3. Click on âCreate Project in Appâ, give your project a title, and press âCreateâ.
  4. Start editing! This copy is your own personal copy to edit however you want!

There are two files included in this project:

  - ` starter.typ ` contains the full template, along with a written guide to help you put your best (single-paged) foot forward!
  - ` resume.typ ` is the same template, but without the full guide included.
  - ` templates/resume.template.typ ` contains the formatting and style for the underlying pieces.

*I would highly recommend reading` starter.typ ` or skimming through the [
online guide ](https://blog.chaoticgood.computer/writing/notes/typst-resume-
template) to understand best practices when using the template. *

===  Alternative: Typst CLI

If youâd prefer to simply download & modify the template, you can use the [
Typst CLI ](https://github.com/typst/typst) to download it instead:



    typst init @preview/resume-starter-cgc


==  Layout

===  Header

The resume can be created with a header with the following attributes:

  - ` author ` : Your name
  - ` location ` : The city, state/province, and country you reside in.
  - ` contacts ` : A list of contact information and additional information

====  Header Example



    #show: resume.with(
      author: "Dr. Emmit \"Doc\" Brown",
      location: "Hill Valley, CA",
      contacts: (
        [#link("mailto:your_email@yourmail.com")[Email]],
        [#link("https://your-cool-site.com")[Website]],
        [#link("https://github.com/your-linkedin")[GitHub]],
        [#link("https://linkedin.com/in/your-linkedin")[LinkedIn]],
      )
    )


===  Education

The Education ( ` #edu ` ) section can be used to highlight for formal
education and certifications.

  - ` institution ` : Name of the institution where you study, or have graduated from.
  - ` date ` : Your graduation date, or expected graduation date.
  - ` degrees ` : The degrees you received at the institution
    - Each entry is two sections: the *title* of the degree, and the *subject* that you studied.
  - ` gpa ` (optional): Your GPA, or other additional information.

====  Education Example



    #edu(
      institution: "University of Colombia",
      date: "Aug 1948",
      gpa: "3.9 of 4.0, Summa Cum Laude",
      degrees: (
        ("Bachelor's of Science", "Nuclear Engineering"),
        ("Minors", "Automobile Design, Arabic"),
        ("Focus", "Childcare, Education")
      ),
    )


===  Skills

An additional Skills ( ` #skills ` ) section to list skills relevant to the
job youâre applying for.

The input is a list of ` Label: Skills[] ` , in order to easily toggle
comments on skills that you may want to leave in but not render for a
particular application.

====  Skills Example



    #skills((
      ("Expertise", (
        [Theoretical Physics],
        [Time Travel],
        [Nuclear Material Management],
        [Student Mentoring],
      )),
      ("Software", (
        [AutoDesk CAD],
        [Delorean OS],
        [Windows 1],
      )),
      ("Languages", (
        [C++],
        [C Language],
        [MatLab],
        [Punch Cards],
      )),
    ))


===  Experience

The bulk of your resume, the Experience ( ` #exp ` ) sections provide a
compact & concise formatting for bulleted details of your previous and current
work experience.

This section is meant to be flexible, and can also be used to talk about
projects and other experiences that may fall outside of the traditional
definition of âwork.â

  - ` role ` : The title of your position/role in this experience.
  - ` project ` : The company you worked at, or the name of the project you worked on.
  - ` date ` : The start and end dates of this experience.
  - ` details ` : A description of the work you did in this position
    - It is *highly encouraged* to use bullet points in this section.
  - ` location ` (optional): The location of the experience
  - ` summary ` (optional): A brief summary of the companyâs mission or project goal.

====  Experience Example



    #exp(
      role: "Theoretical Physics Consultant",
      project: "Doc Brown's Garage",
      date: "June 1953 - Oct 2015",
      location: "Hill Valley, CA",
      summary: "Specializing in development of time travel devices and student tutoring",
      details: [
        - Lead development of time travel devices, resulting in the ability to travel back and forth through time
        - Managed and executed a budget of \$14 million dollars gained from an unexplained family fortune
        - Oversaw QA testing for time travel devices, minimizing risk of maternal time-travel related incidents
      ]
    )

= *numblex.md*

=  numblex

0.2.0

Numbering helper.

How to number the heading like this?

  - Appendix A. XXXX
    - A.1. YYY
    - A.2. ZZZ

Or this?

  - ä¸ãè¯é¢
    - 1\. è®ºç¹
      - (1) è¯æ®

You might use a function:



    #set heading(numbering: (..nums) => {
      if nums.pos().len() == 1 {
        return "Appendix " + numbering("A.", ..nums)
      }
      return numbering("A.1.", ..nums)
    }


Or set up a couple of ` set ` rules:



    #set heading(numbering: "A.1.")
    #show heading.where(level: 1): set heading(numbering: (n) => "Appendix " + numbering("A.", n))
    // No, you can't use "Appendix A." since Typst would treat the first "A" as a numbering


Or simply use Numblex:



    #import "@preview/numblex:0.2.0": numblex

    #set heading(numbering: numblex("{Appendix [A].:d==1;[A].}{[1].}"))


==  Usage



    #import "@preview/numblex:0.2.0": numblex

    #set heading(numbering: numblex("{Section [A].:d==1;[A].}{[1].}{[1])}"))

    #set heading(numbering: numblex("{Section [A].:d==1;[A].}{[1].}{[1])}"))



You can read the [ Manual
](https://github.com/ParaN3xus/numblex/blob/main/manual.pdf) for more
information.

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` numblex `



    #import "@preview/numblex:0.2.0"

0.3.1

Unofficial template for writing a master-thesis in the HAW Hamburg department
of Computer Science design.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=haw-hamburg-master-
thesis&version=0.3.1)

This is an *` unofficial ` * template for writing a master thesis in the `
HAW Hamburg ` department of ` Computer Science ` design using [ Typst
](https://github.com/typst/typst) .

==  Required Fonts

To correctly render this template please make sure that the ` New Computer
Modern ` font is installed on your system.

==  Usage

To use this package just add the following code to your [ Typst
](https://github.com/typst/typst) document:



    #import "@preview/haw-hamburg:0.3.1": master-thesis

    #show: master-thesis.with(
      language: "en",

      title-de: "Beispiel Titel",
      keywords-de: ("Stichwort", "Wichtig", "Super"),
      abstract-de: "Beispiel Zusammenfassung",

      title-en: "Example title",
      keywords-en:  ("Keyword", "Important", "Super"),
      abstract-en: "Example abstract",

      author: "The Computer",
      faculty: "Engineering and Computer Science",
      department: "Computer Science",
      study-course: "Master of Science Computer Science",
      supervisors: ("Prof. Dr. Example", "Prof. Dr. Example"),
      submission-date: datetime(year: 1948, month: 12, day: 10),
      include-declaration-of-independent-processing: true,
    )


==  How to Compile

This project contains an example setup that splits individual chapters into
different files.
This can cause problems when using references etc.
These problems can be avoided by following these steps:

  - Make sure to always compile your ` main.typ ` file which includes all of your chapters for references to work correctly.
  - VSCode:
    - Install the [ Tinymist Typst ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extension.
    - Make sure to start the ` PDF ` or ` Live Preview ` only from within your ` main.typ ` file.
    - If problems occur it usually helps to close the preview and restart it from your ` main.typ ` file.

    	title: "your title",

    	izvleÄek: [
    		your abstract in slovene.
    	],
    	abstract: [
    		your abstract
    	],

    	kljuÄne_besede: ("Typst", "je", "super!"),
    	key_words: ("Typst", "is", "Awesome!"),

    	kratice: (
    		"Famnit": "Fakulteta za matematiko naravoslovje in informacijske tehnologije",
    		"PDF": "Portable document format",
    	),

    	priloge: (), // you can add attachments as a dict of a title and content like `"name": [content],`

    	zahvala: [
    		you can add an acknowlegment.
    	],

      bib_file: bibliography(
        "my_references.bib",
        style: "ieee",
        title: [Bibliography],
      ),

    	/* Additional content and their defaults
     	kraj: "Koper",
    	*/
    )

    // Your content goes below.



==  Abbreviations (kratice)

You can specify Abbreviations at the start as an attribute ` kratice ` and
pass it a dictionary of the abbriviation and itâs explanation. Then you can
reference them in text using ` @<short name> ` to create a link to it.

==  Attachments

Some thesis need Attachments that are shown at the end of the file. To add
these attachments add them in your project under ` priloge ` as a dictionary
of the attachment name and its content. I suggest having a seperate `
attachments.typ ` file, from where you can reference them in the main project.

==  Language

The writing of the thesis can be achieved in two languages; Slovene and
English. They have some differences between them in the way the template is
generated, as the thesis needs to be different for each one. you can specify
the language with the ` text_lang ` attribute.

= *syntree.md*

=  syntree

0.2.0

Linguistics syntax/parse tree rendering

*syntree* is a typst package for rendering syntax trees / parse trees (the
kind linguists use).

The name and syntax are inspired by Miles Shangâs [ syntree
](https://github.com/mshang/syntree) . Hereâs an example to get started:



    #import "@preview/syntree:0.2.0": syntree

    #syntree(
      nonterminal: (font: "Linux Biolinum"),
      terminal: (fill: blue),
      child-spacing: 3em, // default 1em
      layer-spacing: 2em, // default 2.3em
      "[S [NP This] [VP [V is] [^NP a wug]]]"
    )


|  ![Output tree for "This is a wug"](https://github.com/lynn/typst-
syntree/assets/16232127/d0c680b2-4fd0-420f-b350-9e9c96ac37f3)
---|---

Thereâs limited support for formulas inside nodes; try `
#syntree("[DP$zws_i$ this]") ` or ` #syntree("[C $diameter$]") ` .

For more flexible tree-drawing, use ` tree ` :



    #import "@preview/syntree:0.2.0": tree

    #let bx(col) = box(fill: col, width: 1em, height: 1em)
    #tree("colors",
      tree("warm", bx(red), bx(orange)),
      tree("cool", bx(blue), bx(teal)))

==  Introduction

With ` chordx ` you can easily generate song lyrics with chords for writing
songbooks.

` chordx ` generates chord charts for stringed instruments (e.g. guitar,
ukulele, etc.), piano chords (with diferent piano layouts) and single chords
that are chords without charts used to write the chords over a word to write
songbooks.

==  Usage

` chordx ` exports 3 functions to generate diferents types fo charts:

  - ` chart-chord ` : used to generate chart chords for stringed instruments.
  - ` piano-chord ` : used to generate piano chords.
  - ` single-chord ` : used to show the chord name over a word.

===  Typst Packages

Typst added an experimental package repository and you can import ` chordx `
as follows:



    #import "@preview/chordx:0.5.0": *


===  Local Packages

If the package hasnât been released yet, or if you just want to use it from
this repository, you can use __local-packages_ _ .

You can read the documentation about typst [ local-packages
](https://github.com/typst/packages#local-packages) and learn about the path
folders used in differents operating systems (Linux / MacOS / Windows).

In Linux you can do:



    git clone https://github.com/ljgago/typst-chords ~/.local/share/typst/packages/local/chordx/0.5.0


And import the package in your file:



    #import "@local/chordx:0.5.0": *


==  Documentation

Here [ chordx-docs ](https://github.com/ljgago/typst-
chords/blob/v0.5.0/docs/chordx-docs.pdf) you have the reference documentation
that describes the functions and parameters used in this package. ( _Generated
with[ tidy ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/tidy) _ )

==  Examples:

= *hidden-bib.md*

=  hidden-bib

0.1.1

Create hidden bibliographies or bibliographies with unmentioned (hidden)
citations.

[ GitHub Repository including Examples ](https://github.com/pklaschka/typst-
hidden-bib)

A Typst package to create hidden bibliographies or bibliographies with
unmentioned (hidden) citations.

==  Use Cases

===  Hidden Bibliographies

In some documents, such as a letter, you may want to cite a reference without
printing a bibliography.

This can easily be achieved by wrapping your ` bibliography(...) ` with the `
hidden-bibliography ` function after importing the ` hidden-bib ` package.

The code then looks like this:



    #import "@preview/hidden-bib:0.1.0": hidden-bibliography

    #lorem(20) @example1
    #lorem(40) @example2[p. 2]

    #hidden-bibliography(
      bibliography("/refs.yml")
    )


_Note that this automatically sets the` style ` option to ` "chicago-notes" `
unless you specify a different style. _

===  Hidden Citations

In some documents, it may be necessary to include items in your bibliography
which werenât explicitly cited at any specific point in your document.

The code then looks like this:



    #import "@preview/hidden-bib:0.1.0": hidden-cite

    #hidden-cite("example1")


===  Multiple Hidden Citations

If you want to include a large number of items in your bibliography without
having to use ` hidden-cite ` (to still get autocompletion in the web editor),
you can use the ` hidden-citations ` environment.

The code then looks like this:



    #import "@preview/hidden-bib:0.1.0": hidden-citations

    #hidden-citations[
      @example1
      @example2
    ]


==  FAQ

===  Why would I want to have hidden citations and a hidden bibliography?

You donât. While this package solves both (related) problems, you should
only use one of them at a time. Otherwise, youâll simply see nothing at all.

===  Why would I want to have hidden citations?

Thatâs for you to decide. It essentially enables you to include âuncited
referencesâ, similar to LaTeXâs ` \nocite{} ` command.

0.1.0

Julia code evaluation inside your Typst document

![logo](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/jlyfish/0.1.0/assets/logo.svg)

Jlyfish is a package for Julia and Typst that allows you to integrate Julia
computations in your Typst document.

[ ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-wiki-blue)
](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/TypstJlyfish.jl/wiki) ![GitHub
License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/andreasKroepelin/TypstJlyfish.jl)
![GitHub release \(latest by
date\)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/andreasKroepelin/TypstJlyfish.jl)
[ ![GitHub Repo
stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/andreasKroepelin/TypstJlyfish.jl)
](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/TypstJlyfish.jl)

You should use Jlyfish if you want to write a Typst document and have some of
the content automatically produced by Julia code but want the source code for
that within your document source. It fills a similar role as [ PythonTeX
](https://github.com/gpoore/pythontex) does for Python and LaTeX. Note that
this is different from tools like [ Quarto ](https://quarto.org/) where you
write documents in Markdown, also integrate some Julia code, but then might
use Typst only as a backend to produce the final document.

See below for a quick introduction or read the [ wiki
](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/TypstJlyfish.jl/wiki) for an in depth
explanation.

Since Jlyfish builds a bridge between Julia and Typst, we also have to get two
things running. First, install the Julia package ` TypstJlyfish ` from the
general registry by executing



    julia> ]

    (@v1.10) pkg> add TypstJlyfish


You only have to do this once. (It is like installing and using the Pluto
notebook system, if you are familiar with that.)

When you want to use Jlyfish in a Typst document (say, ` your-document.typ `
), add the following line at the top:



    #import "@preview/jlyfish:0.1.0": *


Then, open a Julia REPL and run



    julia> import TypstJlyfish

    julia> TypstJlyfish.watch("your-document.typ")


Jlyfish facilitates the communication between Julia and Typst via a JSON file.
By default, Jlyfish uses the name of your document and adds a ` -jlyfish.json
` , so ` your-document.typ ` would become ` your-document-jlyfish.json ` .
This can be configured, of course.

To let Typst know of the computed data in the JSON file, add the following
line to your document:



    #read-julia-output(json("your-document-jlyfish.json"))


You can then place some Julia code in your Typst source using the ` #jl `
function:



    What is the sum of the whole numbers from one to a hundred? #jl(`sum(1:100)`)

](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/TypstJlyfish.jl/wiki) to learn more!

= *acrostiche.md*

=  acrostiche

0.4.1

Manage acronyms and their definitions in Typst.

Manages acronyms so you donât have to.

==  Quick Start



    #import "@preview/acrostiche:0.4.0": *

    #init-acronyms((
      "WTP": ("Wonderful Typst Package","Wonderful Typst Packages"),
    ))

    Acrostiche is a #acr("WTP")! This #acr("WTP") enables easy acronyms manipulation.

    Its main features are auto-expansion of the first occurence, global or selective expansion reset #reset-all-acronyms(), implicit or manual plural form support (there may be multiple #acrpl("WTP")), and customizable index printing. Have Fun!


==  Usage

The main goal of Acrostiche is to keep track of which acronyms to define.

===  Define acronyms

All acronyms used with Acrostiche must be defined in a dictionary passed to
the ` init-acronyms ` function. There are two possible forms for the
definition, depending on the required features.

====  Simple Definitions

For a quick and easy definion, you can use the acronym to display as the key
and an array of one or more strings as the singular and plural versions of the
expanded meaning of the acronym.



    #init-acronyms((
      "SDA": ("Simply Defined Acronym","Simply Defined Acronyms"),
      "ASDA": ("Another Simply Defined Acronym","Another Simply Defined Acronyms"),
    ))


If there is only a singular version of the definition, the array contains only
one value. If there are both singular and plural versions, define the
definition as an array where the first item is the singular definition and the
second item is the plural.

====  Advanced Definitions

If you find yourself needing more flexibility when defining the acronyms, you
can pass a dictionary for each acronym. The expected keys are: ` short ` the
singular short form to display, ` short-pl ` the plural short form, ` long `
singular long (expanded) form to display, and ` long-pl ` the plural long
form. The main benefit of this definition is to use a separate key for calling
the acronym, useful when acronyms are long and tedious to write.



    #init-acronyms((
      "la": (
    short: "LATATW",
    long: "Long And Tedious Acronym To Write",
    short-pl: "LATAsTW",
    long-pl: "Long And Tedious Acronyms To Write"),
    ))


Any other keys than these will be discarded.

===  Call Acrostiche functions

Once the acronyms are defined, you can use them in the text with the `
#acr(...) ` function. The argument is the acronym as a string (for example,
âBIOSâ). On the first call of the function, it prints the acronym with its
definition (for example, âBasic Input/Output System (BIOS)â). On the next
calls, it prints only the acronym.

To get the plural version of the acronym, you can use the ` #acrpl(...) `
function that adds an âsâ after the acronym. If a plural version of the
definition is provided, it will be used if the first use of the acronym is
plural. Otherwise, the singular version is used, and a trailing âsâ is
added.

To intentionally print the full version of the acronym (definition + acronym,
as for the first instance), without affecting the state, you can use the `
#acrfull(...) ` function. For the plural version, use the ` #acrfullpl(...) `
function. Both functions have shortcuts with ` #acrf(...) ` and ` #acrfpl(...)
` .

At any point in the document, you can reset acronyms with the functions `
#reset-acronym(...) ` (for a single acronym) or ` reset-all-acronyms() ` (to
reset all acronyms). After a reset, the next use of the acronym is expanded.
Both functions have shortcuts with ` #racr(...) ` and ` #raacr(...) ` .

You can also print an index of all acronyms used in the document with the ` #print-index() ` function. The index is printed as a section for which you can choose the heading level, the numbering, and the outline parameters (with respectively the ` level: int ` , ` numbering: none | string | function ` , and ` outlined: bool ` parameters). You can also choose their order with the ` sorted: string ` parameter that accepts either an empty string (print in the order they are defined), âupâ (print in ascending alphabetical order), or âdownâ (print in descending alphabetical order). By default, the index contains all the acronyms you defined. You can choose to only display acronyms that are actually used in the document by passing ` used-only: true ` to the function. Warning, the detection of used acronym uses the states at the end of the document. Thus, if you reset an acronym and do not use it again until the end, it will not appear in the index. You can use the ` title: string ` parameter to change the name of the heading for the index section. The default value is âAcronyms Indexâ. Passing an empty string for ` title ` results in the index having no heading (i.e., no section for the index). You can customize the string displayed after the acronym in the list with the ` delimiter: ":" ` parameter. To adjust the spacing between the acronyms adjust the ` row-gutter: auto | int | relative | fraction | array ` parameter, the default is ` 2pt ` .

Finally, you can call the ` #display-def(...) ` function to display the
definition of an acronym. Set the ` plural ` parameter to true to get the
plural version.

===  Functions Summary:

*Function* |  *Description*
---|---
*#init-acronyms(â¦)* |  Initializes the acronyms by defining them in a dictionary where the keys are acronyms and the values are definitions.
*#acr(â¦)* |  Prints the acronym with its definition on the first call, then just the acronym in subsequent calls.
*#acrpl(â¦)* |  Prints the plural version of the acronym. Uses plural definition if available, otherwise adds an âsâ to the acronym.
*#acrfull(â¦)* |  Displays the full (long) version of the acronym without affecting the state or tracking its usage.
*#acrfullpl(â¦)* |  Displays the full plural version of the acronym without affecting the state or tracking its usage.
*#reset-acronym(â¦)* |  Resets a single acronym so the next usage will include its definition again.
*#reset-all-acronyms()* |  Resets all acronyms so the next usage will include their definitions again.
*#print-index(â¦)* |  Prints an index of all acronyms used, with customizable heading level, order, and display parameters.
*#display-def(â¦)* |  Displays the definition of an acronym. Use ` plural: true ` to display the plural version of the definition.
*racr, raacr, acrf, acrfpl* |  Shortcuts names for respectively ` reset-acronym ` , ` reset-all-acronyms ` , ` acrfull ` , and ` acrfullpl ` .

==  Advanced Definitions

This is a bit of a hacky feature coming from pure serendipity. There is no
enforcement of the type of the definitions. Most users would naturally use
strings as definitions, but any other content is acceptable. For example, you
set your definition to a content block with rainbow-fille text, or even an
image. The rainbow text is kinda cool because the gradient depend on the
position in the page so depending on the position of first use the acronym
will have a pseudo-random color.

If you use anything else than string for the definition, do not forget the
trailing comma to force the definition to be an array (an array of a single
element is not an array in Typst at the time of writing this). I cannot
guarantee that arbitrary content will remain available in future versions but
I will do my best to keep it as it is kinda cool. If you find cool uses,
please reach out to show me!

> Yes it is posible to build nest/recursive acronyms definitions. If you point
> to another acronym, it all works fine. If you point to the same acronym, you
> obviously create a recursive situation, and it fails. It will not converge,
> and the compiler will warn you and will panic. Be nice to the compiler,
> don't throw recursive traps.

Here is a minimal working example of funky acronyms:



    #import "@preview/acrostiche:0.4.0": *
    #init-acronyms((
      "RFA": ([#text(fill: gradient.linear(..color.map.rainbow))[Rainbow Filled Acronym]],),
      "NA": ([Nested #acr("RFA") Acronym],)
    ))
    #acr("NA")


==  Possible Errors:

  - If an acronym is not defined, an error will tell you which one is causing the error. Simply add it to the dictionary or check the spelling.
  - ` display-def ` leverages the state ` display ` function and only works if the return value is actually printed in the document. For more information on states, see the Typst documentation on states.
  - Acrostiche uses a state named ` acronyms ` to keep track of the definitions and usage. If you redefined this state or use it manually in your document, unexpacted behaviour might happen.

= *apa7-ish.md*

![A preview of the apa7-ish Typst
template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/apa7-ish-0.2.0-small.webp)

=  apa7-ish

0.2.0

Typst Template that (mostly) complies with APA7 Style (Work in Progress).

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=apa7-ish&version=0.2.0)

[ Typst ](https://typst.app/) Template that (mostly) complies with APA7 Style
(Work in Progress).

The template does not follow all recommendations by the APA Manual, especially
when the suggestions break with typographic conventions (such as double line
spacing :vomiting_face:). Instead, the goal of this template is that it
generates you a high-quality manuscript that has all the important components
of the APA7 format, but is aesthetically pleasing.

The following works already quite well:

  - consistent and simple typesetting
  - correct display of author information / author note
  - citations anfalsed references
  - Page headers and footers (show short title in header)
  - Option to anonymize the paper
  - Tables: consisting of 3 parts (caption, content, and table notes)

This is still not finished:

  - figures
  - complete pandoc integration (template for pandoc to replace Latex-based workflows)
  - automatic calculation of page margins (like memoir-class for Latex)

The easiest way to get started is to edit the example file, which has sensible
default values. Most fields in the configuration are optional and will safely
be ignored (not rendered) when you set them to ` none ` .

==  Authors

The ` authors ` setting expects an array of dictionaries with the following
fields:



    (
      name: "First Name Last Name", // Name of author as it should appear on the paper title page
      affiliation: "University, Department", // affiliation(s) of author as it should appear on the title page
      orcid: "0000-0000-0000-0000", // optional for author note
      corresponding: true, // optional to mark an author as corresponding author
      email: "email@upenn.edu", // optional email address, required if author is corresponding
      postal: "Longer string", // optional postal address for corresponding author
    )


Note that the ` affiliation ` field also accepts an array, in case an author
has several affiliations:



    (
      name: "First Name Last Name",
      affiliation: ("University A", "University B")
      ...
    )


==  Anonymization

Sometimes you need to submit a paper without any author information. In such
cases you can set ` anonymous ` to ` true ` .

==  Tables

The template has basic support for tables with a handful of utilities.
Analogous to the [ Latex booktabs package ](https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs) ,
there are pre-defined horizontal lines (ârulesâ):

  - ` #toprule ` : used at the top of the table, before the first row
  - ` #midrule ` : used to separate the header row, or to separate a totals row at the bottom
  - ` #bottomrule ` : used after the last row (technically the same as toprule, but may be useful later to define custom behaviour)

Addtionally, there is a ` #tablenote ` function to be used to place a table
note below the table.

A minimal usage example (taken from the typst documentation):



    // wrap everything in a #figure
    #figure(
      [
        #table(
          columns: 2,
          align: left,
          toprule, // separate table from other content

= *prequery.md*

=  prequery

0.1.0

library for extracting metadata for preprocessing from a typst document

This package helps extracting metadata for preprocessing from a typst
document, for example image URLs for download from the web. Typst compilations
are sandboxed: it is not possible for Typst packages, or even just a Typst
document itself, to access the âouside worldâ. This sandboxing of Typst
has good reasons. Yet, it is often convenient to trade a bit of security for
convenience by weakening it. Prequery helps with that by providing some simple
scaffolding for supporting preprocessing of documents.

Hereâs an example for referencing images from the internet:



    #import "@preview/prequery:0.1.0"

    // toggle this comment or pass `--input prequery-fallback=true` to enable fallback
    // #prequery.fallback.update(true)

    #prequery.image(
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png",
      "assets/wikipedia.png")


Using ` typst query ` , the image URL(s) are extracted from the document:



    typst query --input prequery-fallback=true --field value \
        main.typ ''


This will output the following piece of JSON:



    [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "path": "assets/wikipedia.png"}]


Which can then be used to download all images to the expected locations.

See the [ manual
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/prequery/0.1.0/docs/manual.pdf)
for details.

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` prequery `

0.1.1

Chinese lipsum text generator; ä¸­æä¹±æ°åæï¼Lorem Ipsumï¼çæå¨

` kouhu ` is a Chinese lipsum text generator for [ Typst ](https://typst.app/)
. It provides a set of built-in text samples containing both Simplified and
Traditional Chinese characters. You can choose from generated fake text,
classic or modern Chinese literature, or specify your own text.

` kouhu ` is inspired by [ zhlipsum ](https://ctan.org/pkg/zhlipsum) LaTeX
package and [ roremu ](https://typst.app/universe/package/roremu) Typst
package.

All [ sample text
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/kouhu/0.1.1/data/zhlipsum.json)
is excerpted from ` zhlipsum ` LaTeX package (see Appendix for details).

==  Usage



    #import "@preview/kouhu:0.1.0": kouhu

    #kouhu(indicies: range(1, 3)) // select the first 3 paragraphs from default text

    #kouhu(builtin-text: "zhufu", offset: 5, length: 100) // select 100 characters from the 5th paragraph of "zhufu" text

    #kouhu(custom-text: ("Foo", "Bar")) // provide your own text


See [ manual ](https://github.com/Harry-Chen/kouhu/blob/master/doc/manual.pdf)
for more details.

==  What does ` kouhu ` mean?

GitHub Copilot says:

> ` kouhu ` (å£è¡) is a Chinese term for reading aloud without understanding
> the meaning. It is often used in the context of learning Chinese language or
> reciting Chinese literature.

==  Changelog

==  Input Format and Creation

The ` tabut ` function takes input in ârecordâ format, an array of
dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a single âobjectâ or
ârecordâ.

In the example below, each record is a listing for an office supply product.



    #let supplies = (
      (name: "Notebook", price: 3.49, quantity: 5),
      (name: "Ballpoint Pens", price: 5.99, quantity: 2),
      (name: "Printer Paper", price: 6.99, quantity: 3),
    )


==  Basic Table

Now create a basic table from the data.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies, // the source of the data used to generate the table
      ( // column definitions
        (
          header: [Name], // label, takes content.
          func: r => r.name // generates the cell content.
        ),
        (header: [Price], func: r => r.price),
        (header: [Quantity], func: r => r.quantity),
      )
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/basic.svg)

` funct ` takes a function which generates content for a given cell
corrosponding to the defined column for each record. ` r ` is the record, so `
r => r.name ` returns the ` name ` property of each record in the input data
if it has one.

The philosphy of ` tabut ` is that the display of data should be simple and
clearly defined, therefore each column and itâs content and formatting
should be defined within a single clear column defintion. One consequence is
you can comment out, remove or move, any column easily, for example:



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: [Price], func: r => r.price), // This column is moved to the front
        (header: [Name], func: r => r.name),
        (header: [Name 2], func: r => r.name), // copied
        // (header: [Quantity], func: r => r.quantity), // removed via comment
      )
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/rearrange.svg)

==  Table Styling

Any default Table style options can be tacked on and are passed to the final
table function.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: [Name], func: r => r.name),
        (header: [Price], func: r => r.price),
        (header: [Quantity], func: r => r.quantity),
      ),
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/styling.svg)

==  Header Formatting

You can pass any content or expression into the header property.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #let fmt(it) = {
      heading(
        outlined: false,
        upper(it)
      )
    }

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: fmt([Name]), func: r => r.name ),
        (header: fmt([Price]), func: r => r.price),
        (header: fmt([Quantity]), func: r => r.quantity),
      ),
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/title.svg)

==  Remove Headers

You can prevent from being generated with the ` headers ` paramater. This is
useful with the ` tabut-cells ` function as demonstrated in itâs section.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: [*Name*], func: r => r.name),
        (header: [*Price*], func: r => r.price),
        (header: [*Quantity*], func: r => r.quantity),
      ),
      headers: false, // Prevents Headers from being generated
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none,
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/no-headers.svg)

==  Cell Expressions and Formatting

Just like the headers, cell contents can be modified and formatted like any
content in Typst.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "usd.typ": usd
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: [*Name*], func: r => r.name ),
        (header: [*Price*], func: r => usd(r.price)),
      ),
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/format.svg)

You can have the cell content function do calculations on a record property.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "usd.typ": usd
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: [*Name*], func: r => r.name ),
        (header: [*Price*], func: r => usd(r.price)),
        (header: [*Tax*], func: r => usd(r.price * .2)),
        (header: [*Total*], func: r => usd(r.price * 1.2)),
      ),
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/calculation.svg)

Or even combine multiple record properties, go wild.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut

    #let employees = (
        (id: 3251, first: "Alice", last: "Smith", middle: "Jane"),
        (id: 4872, first: "Carlos", last: "Garcia", middle: "Luis"),
        (id: 5639, first: "Evelyn", last: "Chen", middle: "Ming")
    );

    #tabut(
      employees,
      (
        (header: [*ID*], func: r => r.id ),
        (header: [*Full Name*], func: r => [#r.first #r.middle.first(), #r.last] ),
      ),
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/combine.svg)

==  Index

` tabut ` automatically adds an ` _index ` property to each record.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: [*\#*], func: r => r._index),
        (header: [*Name*], func: r => r.name ),
      ),
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/index.svg)

You can also prevent the ` index ` property being generated by setting it to `
none ` , or you can also set an alternate name of the index property as shown
below.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: [*\#*], func: r => r.index-alt ),
        (header: [*Name*], func: r => r.name ),
      ),
      index: "index-alt", // set an aternate name for the automatically generated index property.
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/index-alternate.svg)

==  Transpose

This was annoying to implement, and I donât know when youâd actually use
this, but here.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "usd.typ": usd
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: [*\#*], func: r => r._index),
        (header: [*Name*], func: r => r.name),
        (header: [*Price*], func: r => usd(r.price)),
        (header: [*Quantity*], func: r => r.quantity),
      ),
      transpose: true,  // set optional name arg `transpose` to `true`
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/transpose.svg)

==  Alignment



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "usd.typ": usd
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      ( // Include `align` as an optional arg to a column def
        (header: [*\#*], func: r => r._index),
        (header: [*Name*], align: right, func: r => r.name),
        (header: [*Price*], align: right, func: r => usd(r.price)),
        (header: [*Quantity*], align: right, func: r => r.quantity),
      ),
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/align.svg)

You can also define Alignment manually as in the the standard Table Function.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "usd.typ": usd
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #tabut(
      supplies,
      (
        (header: [*\#*], func: r => r._index),
        (header: [*Name*], func: r => r.name),
        (header: [*Price*], func: r => usd(r.price)),
        (header: [*Quantity*], func: r => r.quantity),
      ),
      align: (auto, right, right, right), // Alignment defined as in standard table function
      fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
      stroke: none
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-

==  Column Width



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "usd.typ": usd
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #box(
      width: 300pt,
      tabut(
        supplies,
        ( // Include `width` as an optional arg to a column def
          (header: [*\#*], func: r => r._index),
          (header: [*Name*], width: 1fr, func: r => r.name),
          (header: [*Price*], width: 20%, func: r => usd(r.price)),
          (header: [*Quantity*], width: 1.5in, func: r => r.quantity),
        ),
        fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },
        stroke: none,
      )
    )



![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-

You can also define Columns manually as in the the standard Table Function.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut
    #import "usd.typ": usd
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

          (header: [*Quantity*], func: r => r.quantity),
        ),
        columns: (auto, 1fr, 20%, 1.5in),  // Columns defined as in standard table
        fill: (_, row) => if calc.odd(row) { luma(240) } else { luma(220) },

      )
    )

          (header: [], func: r => r.quantity),
        ),
        headers: false
      )
    )


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tabut/1.0.2/doc/compiled-
snippets/tablex.svg)

While technically seperate from table display, the following are examples of
how to perform operations on data before it is displayed with ` tabut ` .

Since ` tabut ` assumes an âarray of dictionariesâ format, then most data
operations can be performed easily with Typstâs native array functions. `
tabut ` also provides several functions to provide additional functionality.

==  CSV Data

By default, imported CSV gives a ârowsâ or âarray of arraysâ data
format, which can not be directly used by ` tabut ` . To convert, ` tabut `
includes a function ` rows-to-records ` demonstrated below.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut, rows-to-records
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #let titanic = {
      let titanic-raw = csv("example-data/titanic.csv");
      rows-to-records(
        titanic-raw.first(), // The header row
        titanic-raw.slice(1, -1), // The rest of the rows
      )
    }


Imported CSV data are all strings, so itâs usefull to convert them to ` int
` or ` float ` when possible.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut, rows-to-records
    #import "example-data/supplies.typ": supplies

    #let auto-type(input) = {
      let is-int = (input.match(regex("^-?\d+$")) != none);
      if is-int { return int(input); }
      let is-float = (input.match(regex("^-?(inf|nan|\d+|\d*(\.\d+))$")) != none);
      if is-float { return float(input) }
      input
    }

    #let titanic = {
      let titanic-raw = csv("example-data/titanic.csv");
      rows-to-records( titanic-raw.first(), titanic-raw.slice(1, -1) )
      .map( r => {
        let new-record = (:);
        for (k, v) in r.pairs() { new-record.insert(k, auto-type(v)); }
        new-record
      })
    }


` tabut ` includes a function, ` records-from-csv ` , to automatically perform
this process.



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": records-from-csv

    #let titanic = records-from-csv(csv("example-data/titanic.csv"));


==  Slice



    #import "@preview/tabut:1.0.2": tabut, records-from-csv
    #import "usd.typ": usd

    #let classes = (

==  ` tabut `

Takes data and column definitions and outputs a table.



    tabut(
      data-raw,
      colDefs,
      columns: auto,
      align: auto,
      index: "_index",
      transpose: false,
      headers: true,
      ..tableArgs
    ) -> content


===  Parameters

` data-raw `
This is the raw data that will be used to generate the table. The data is
expected to be in an array of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a
single record or object.

` colDefs `
These are the column definitions. An array of dictionaries, each representing
column definition. Must include the properties ` header ` and a ` func ` . `
header ` expects content, and specifies the label of the column. ` func `
expects a function, the function takes a record dictionary as input and
returns the value to be displayed in the cell corresponding to that record and
column. There are also two optional properties; ` align ` sets the alignment
of the content within the cells of the column, ` width ` sets the width of the
column.

` columns `
(optional, default: ` auto ` ) Specifies the column widths. If set to ` auto `
, the function automatically generates column widths by each columnâs column
definition. Otherwise functions exactly the ` columns ` paramater of the
standard Typst ` table ` function. Unlike the ` tabut-cells ` setting this to
` none ` will break.

` align `
(optional, default: ` auto ` ) Specifies the column alignment. If set to `
auto ` , the function automatically generates column alignment by each
columnâs column definition. If set to ` none ` no ` align ` property is
added to the output arg. Otherwise functions exactly the ` align ` paramater
of the standard Typst ` table ` function.

` index `
(optional, default: ` "_index" ` ) Specifies the property name for the index
of each record. By default, an ` _index ` property is automatically added to
each record. If set to ` none ` , no index property is added.

` transpose `
(optional, default: ` false ` ) If set to ` true ` , transposes the table,
swapping rows and columns.

` headers `
(optional, default: ` true ` ) Determines whether headers should be included
in the output. If set to ` false ` , headers are not generated.

` tableArgs `
(optional) Any additional arguments are passed to the ` table ` function, can
be used for styling or anything else.

==  ` tabut-cells `

The ` tabut-cells ` function functions as ` tabut ` , but returns ` arguments
` for use in either the standard ` table ` function or other tools such as `
tablex ` . If you just want the array of cells, use the ` pos ` function on
the returned value, ex ` tabut-cells(...).pos ` .

` tabut-cells ` is particularly useful when you need to generate only the cell
contents of a table or when these cells need to be passed to another function
for further processing or customization.

===  Function Signature



    tabut-cells(
      data-raw,
      colDefs,
      columns: auto,
      align: auto,
      index: "_index",
      transpose: false,
      headers: true,
    ) -> arguments


===  Parameters

` data-raw `
This is the raw data that will be used to generate the table. The data is
expected to be in an array of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a
single record or object.

` colDefs `
These are the column definitions. An array of dictionaries, each representing
column definition. Must include the properties ` header ` and a ` func ` . `
header ` expects content, and specifies the label of the column. ` func `
expects a function, the function takes a record dictionary as input and
returns the value to be displayed in the cell corresponding to that record and
column. There are also two optional properties; ` align ` sets the alignment
of the content within the cells of the column, ` width ` sets the width of the
column.

` columns `
(optional, default: ` auto ` ) Specifies the column widths. If set to ` auto `
, the function automatically generates column widths by each columnâs column
definition. If set to ` none ` no ` column ` property is added to the output
arg. Otherwise functions exactly the ` columns ` paramater of the standard
typst ` table ` function.

` align `
(optional, default: ` auto ` ) Specifies the column alignment. If set to `
auto ` , the function automatically generates column alignment by each
columnâs column definition. If set to ` none ` no ` align ` property is
added to the output arg. Otherwise functions exactly the ` align ` paramater
of the standard typst ` table ` function.

` index `
(optional, default: ` "_index" ` ) Specifies the property name for the index
of each record. By default, an ` _index ` property is automatically added to
each record. If set to ` none ` , no index property is added.

` transpose `
(optional, default: ` false ` ) If set to ` true ` , transposes the table,
swapping rows and columns.

` headers `
(optional, default: ` true ` ) Determines whether headers should be included
in the output. If set to ` false ` , headers are not generated.

==  ` records-from-csv `

Automatically converts a CSV data into an array of records.



    records-from-csv(
      data
    ) -> array


===  Parameters

` data `
The CSV data that needs to be converted, this can be obtained using the native
` csv ` function, like ` records-from-csv(csv(file-path)) ` .

This function simplifies the process of converting CSV data into a format
compatible with ` tabut ` . It reads the CSV data, extracts the headers, and
converts each row into a dictionary, using the headers as keys.

It also automatically converts data into floats or integers when possible.

==  ` rows-to-records `

Converts rows of data into an array of records based on specified headers.

This function is useful for converting data in a ârowsâ format (commonly
found in CSV files) into an array of dictionaries format, which is required
for ` tabut ` and allows easy data processing using the built in array
functions.



    rows-to-records(
      headers,
      rows,
      default: none
    ) -> array


===  Parameters

` headers `
An array representing the headers of the table. Each item in this array
corresponds to a column header.

` rows `
An array of arrays, each representing a row of data. Each sub-array contains
the cell data for a corresponding row.

` default `
(optional, default: ` none ` ) A default value to use when a cell is empty or
there is an error.

==  ` group `

Groups data based on a specified function and returns an array of grouped
records.



    group(
      data,
      function
    ) -> array


===  Parameters

` data `
An array of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a single record or
object.

` function `
A function that takes a record as input and returns a value based on which the
grouping is to be performed.

This function iterates over each record in the ` data ` , applies the `
function ` to determine the grouping value, and organizes the records into
groups based on this value. Each group record is represented as a dictionary
with two properties: ` value ` (the result of the grouping function) and `
group ` (an array of records belonging to this group).

In the context of ` tabut ` , the ` group ` function is particularly useful
for creating summary tables where records need to be categorized and
aggregated based on certain criteria, such as calculating total or average
values for each group.

0.4.0

Paper template for submission to Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=classic-jmlr&version=0.4.0)

==  Overview

This is a Typst template for Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR). It
is based on official [ author guide ](https://www.jmlr.org/format/authors-
guide.html) , [ formatting instructions
](https://www.jmlr.org/format/format.html) , and [ formatting error checklist
](https://www.jmlr.org/format/formatting-errors.html) as well as the official
[ example paper ](https://github.com/jmlrorg/jmlr-style-file) .

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking _Start from
template_ on the dashboard and searching for ` classic-jmlr ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/classic-jmlr


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` jmlr ` function with the following named
arguments.

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` short-title ` : Paper short title (for page header).
  - ` authors ` : An array of author dictionaries. Each of the author dictionaries must have a name key and can have the keys department, organization, location, and email.
  - ` last-names ` : List of authors last names (for page header).
  - ` keywords ` : Publication keywords (used in PDF metadata).
  - ` date ` : Creation date (used in PDF metadata).
  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or none. Appears at the top under the title.
  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the bibliography function or none. The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the paper.
  - ` appendix ` : Content to append after bibliography section.
  - ` pubdata ` : Dictionary with auxiliary information about publication. It contains editor name(s), paper id, volume, and submission/review/publishing dates.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` jmlr `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule at the top of your file.

        published-at: datetime(year: 2022, month: 9, day: 1),
      ),
    )


==  Issues

This template is developed at [ daskol/typst-templates
](https://github.com/daskol/typst-templates) repo. Please report all issues
there.

  - Original JMLR example paper is not not representative. It does not demonstrate appearance of figures, images, tables, lists, etc.

  - Leading in author affilations in in the original template is varying.

  - There is no bibliography CSL-style. The closest one is ` bristol-university-press ` .

  - Another issue is related to Typstâs inablity to produce colored annotation. In order to mitigte the issue, we add a script which modifies annotations and make them colored.

        ../colorize-annotations.py \
        example-paper.typst.pdf example-paper-colored.typst.pdf

table](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/modpattern/0.1.0/examples/comparison.png)

==  modpattern function

The function with the signature ` modpattern(size, body, dx: 0pt, dy: 0pt,
background: none) ` has the following parameters:

  - ` size ` is as size for patterns
  - ` body ` is the inside/body/content of the pattern
  - ` dx ` , ` dy ` allow for translations
  - ` background ` allows any type allowed in the box fill argument. It gets applied first

Notice that, in contrast to typst patterns, size is a positional argument.

Take a look at the example directory, to understand how to use this and to see
the reasoning behind the ` background ` argument.

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` modpattern `



    #import "@preview/modpattern:0.1.0"

==  Example



    #import "@preview/silky-slides-insa:0.1.1": *
    #show: insa-slides.with(
      title: "Titre du diaporama",
      title-visual: none,

      insa: "rennes"
    )

    = Titre de section

    == Titre d'une slide

    On peut aussi faire un #text(fill: insa-colors.secondary)[texte] avec les #text(fill: insa-colors.primary)[couleurs de l'INSA] !

    == Une autre slide

    Du texte

    #pause

    Et un autre texte qui apparaÃ®t plus tard !

    #section-slide[Une autre section][Avec une petite description]

    Coucou


==  Usage

===  Slide show rule

You call it with ` #show: insa-slides.with(..parameters) ` .

Parameter  |  Description  |  Type  |  Example
---|---|---|---
*title* |  Title of the presentation  |  content  |  ` [Titre de la prez] `
*title-visual* |  Content shown at the right of the title slide  |  content  |  none
*subtitle* |  Subtitle of the presentation  |  content  |  ` [Sous-titre] `
*insa* |  INSA name ( ` rennes ` , ` hdf ` â¦)  |  str  |  ` "rennes" `

If you assign a content to ` title-visual ` , the title slide will
automatically switch layout to the âvisualâ one from the graphic charter.
If you do not assign a visual content, the title slide will only contain the
title and subtitle and will choose the simple layout.

===  Section slide

A section slide is automatically created when you put a level-1 header in your
markup. For example:



    = Slide section
    Blablabla


Will create a section slide with the title âSlide sectionâ and will be
followed by a content slide containing âBlablablaâ.

If you want to put a subtitle in your section slide, you must explicitely use
the ` section-slide ` function like so:



    #section-slide[Titre de section][Description de section]


==  Fonts

The graphic charter recommends the fonts *League Spartan* for headings and
*Source Serif* for regular text. To have the best look, you should install
those fonts.

> You can download the fonts from [ here ](https://github.com/SkytAsul/INSA-
> Typst-Template/tree/main/fonts) .

To behave correctly on computers lacking those specific fonts, this template
will automatically fallback to similar ones:

  - *League Spartan* -> *Arial* (approved by INSAâs graphic charter, by default in Windows) -> *Liberation Sans* (by default in most Linux)
  - *Source Serif* -> *Source Serif 4* (downloadable for free) -> *Georgia* (approved by the graphic charter) -> *Linux Libertine* (default Typst font)

===  Note on variable fonts

If you want to install those fonts on your computer, Typst might not recognize
them if you install their _Variable_ versions. You should install the static
versions ( *League Spartan Bold* and most versions of *Source Serif* ).

Keep an eye on [ the issue in Typst bug tracker
](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/185) to see when variable fonts will
be used!

==  Notes

This template is being developed by Youenn LE JEUNE from the INSA de Rennes in
[ this repository ](https://github.com/SkytAsul/INSA-Typst-Template) .

For now it includes assets from the graphic charters of those INSAs:

  - Rennes ( ` rennes ` )
  - Hauts de France ( ` hdf ` )
  - Centre Val de Loire ( ` cvl ` ) Users from other INSAs can open a pull request on the repository with the assets for their INSA.

If you have any other feature request, open an issue on the repository.

= *mitex.md*

=  mitex

0.2.4

LaTeX support for Typst, powered by Rust and WASM.

*[ LaTeX ](https://www.latex-project.org/) support for [ Typst
](https://typst.app/) , powered by [ Rust ](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [
WASM ](https://webassembly.org/) . *

[ MiTeX ](https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex) processes LaTeX code into an
abstract syntax tree (AST). Then it transforms the AST into Typst code and
evaluates code into Typst content by ` eval ` function.

MiTeX has been proved to be practical on a large project. It has already
correctly converted 32.5k equations from [ OI Wiki ](https://github.com/OI-
wiki/OI-wiki) . Compared to [ texmath ](https://github.com/jgm/texmath) ,
MiTeX has a better display effect and performance in that wiki project. It is
also more easy to use, since importing MiTeX to Typst is just one line of
code, while texmath is an external program.

In addition, MiTeX is not only *SMALL* but also *FAST* ! MiTeX has a size
of just about 185 KB, comparing that texmath has a size of 17 MB. A not strict
but intuitive comparison is shown below. To convert 32.5k equations from OI
Wiki, texmath takes about 109s, while MiTeX WASM takes only 2.28s and MiTeX
x86 takes merely 0.085s.

Thanks to [ @Myriad-Dreamin ](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin) , he
completed the most complex development work: developing the parser for
generating AST.

==  MiTeX as a Typst Package

  - Use ` mitex-convert ` to convert LaTeX code into Typst code in string.
  - Use ` mi ` to render an inline LaTeX equation in Typst.
  - Use ` mitex(numbering: none, supplement: auto, ..) ` or ` mimath ` to render a block LaTeX equation in Typst.
  - Use ` mitext ` to render a LaTeX text in Typst.

PS: ` #set math.equation(numbering: "(1)") ` is also valid for MiTeX.

Following is [ a simple example ](https://github.com/mitex-
rs/mitex/blob/main/packages/mitex/examples/example.typ) of using MiTeX in
Typst:



    #import "@preview/mitex:0.2.4": *

    #assert.eq(mitex-convert("\alpha x"), "alpha  x ")

    Write inline equations like #mi("x") or #mi[y].

    Also block equations (this case is from #text(blue.lighten(20%), link("https://katex.org/")[katex.org])):

    #mitex(`
      \newcommand{\f}[2]{#1f(#2)}
      \f\relax{x} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
        \f\hat\xi\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
        \,d\xi
    `)

    We also support text mode (in development):

    #mitext(`
      \iftypst
        #set math.equation(numbering: "(1)", supplement: "equation")
      \fi

      \section{Title}

      A \textbf{strong} text, a \emph{emph} text and inline equation $x + y$.

      Also block \eqref{eq:pythagoras}.

      \begin{equation}
        a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \label{eq:pythagoras}
      \end{equation}
    `)


![example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/mitex/0.2.4/examples/example.png)

==  MiTeX as a CLI Tool

===  Installation

Install latest nightly version by ` cargo install --git
https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex mitex-cli ` .

===  Usage



    mitex compile main.tex
    # or (same as above)
    mitex compile main.tex mitex.typ


==  MiTeX as a Web App

===  MiTeX Online Math Converter

We can convert LaTeX equations to Typst equations in web by wasm. [
https://mitex-rs.github.io/mitex/ ](https://mitex-rs.github.io/mitex/)

===  Underleaf

We made a proof of concept online tex editor to show our conversion speed in
text mode. The PoC loads files from a git repository and then runs typst
compile in browser. As you see, each keystroking get response in preview
quickly.

rs/mitex/assets/34951714/0ce77a2c-0a7d-445f-b26d-e139f3038f83)

==  Implemented Features

  - [x] User-defined TeX (macro) commands, such as ` \newcommand{\mysym}{\alpha} ` .
  - [x] LaTeX equations support.
    - [x] Coloring commands ( ` \color{red} text ` , ` \textcolor{red}{text} ` ).
    - [x] Support for various environments, such as aligned, matrix, cases.
  - [x] Basic text mode support, you can use it to write LaTeX drafts.
    - [x] ` \section ` , ` \textbf ` , ` \emph ` .
    - [x] Inline and block math equations.
    - [x] ` \ref ` , ` \eqref ` and ` \label ` .
    - [x] ` itemize ` and ` enumerate ` environments.

==  Features to Implement

  - [ ] Pass command specification to MiTeX plugin dynamically. With that you can define a typst function ` let myop(it) = op(upright(it)) ` and then use it by ` \myop{it} ` .
  - [ ] Package support, which means that you can change set of commands by telling MiTeX to use a list of packages.
  - [ ] Better text mode support, such as figure, algorithm and description environments.

To achieve the latter two goals, we need a well-structured architecture for
the text mode, along with intricate work. Currently, we donât have very
clear ideas yet. If you are willing to contribute by discussing in the issues
or even submitting pull requests, your contribution is highly welcome.

==  Differences between MiTeX and other solutions

MiTeX has different objectives compared to [ texmath
](https://github.com/jgm/texmath) (a.k.a. [ pandoc ](https://pandoc.org/) ):

  - MiTeX focuses on rendering LaTeX content correctly within Typst, leveraging the powerful programming capabilities of WASM and typst to achieve results that are essentially consistent with LaTeX display.
  - texmath aims to be general-purpose converters and generate strings that are more human-readable.

For example, MiTeX transforms ` \frac{1}{2}_3 ` into ` frac(1, 2)_3 ` , while
texmath converts it into ` 1 / 2_3 ` . The latterâs display is not entirely
correct, whereas the former ensures consistency in display.

Another example is that MiTeX transforms ` (\frac{1}{2}) ` into ` \(frac(1,
2)\) ` instead of ` (frac(1, 2)) ` , avoiding the use of automatic Left/Right
to achieve consistency with LaTeX rendering.

*Certainly, the greatest advantage is that you can directly write LaTeX
content in Typst without the need for manual conversion!*

==  Submitting Issues

If you find missing commands or bugs of MiTeX, please feel free to submit an
issue [ here ](https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex/issues) .

==  Contributing to MiTeX

Currently, MiTeX maintains following three parts of code:

  - A TeX parser library written in *Rust* , see [ mitex-lexer ](https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex/tree/main/crates/mitex-lexer) and [ mitex-parser ](https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex/tree/main/crates/mitex-parser) .
  - A TeX to Typst converter library written in *Rust* , see [ mitex ](https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex/tree/main/crates/mitex) .
  - A list of TeX packages and comamnds written in *Typst* , which then used by the typst package, see [ MiTeX Command Specification ](https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex/tree/main/packages/mitex/specs) .

For a translation process, for example, we have:



    \frac{1}{2}

    ===[parser]===> AST ===[converter]===>

    #eval("$frac(1, 2)$", scope: (frac: (num, den) => $(num)/(den)$))


You can use the ` #mitex-convert() ` function to get the Typst Code generated
from LaTeX Code.

===  Add missing TeX commands

Even if you donât know Rust at all, you can still add missing TeX commands
to MiTeX by modifying [ specification files ](https://github.com/mitex-
rs/mitex/tree/main/packages/mitex/specs) , since they are written in typst!
You can open an issue to acquire the commands you want to add, or you can edit
the files and submit a pull request.

In the future, we will provide the ability to customize TeX commands, which
will make it easier for you to use the commands you create for yourself.

===  Develop the parser and the converter

See [ CONTRIBUTING.md ](https://github.com/mitex-
rs/mitex/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) .

= *diagraph.md*

=  diagraph

0.3.0

Draw graphs with Graphviz. Use mathematical formulas as labels.

A simple Graphviz binding for Typst using the WebAssembly plugin system.

==  Usage

===  Basic usage

You can render a Graphviz Dot string to a SVG image using the ` render `
function:



    #render("digraph { a -> b }")


Alternatively, you can use ` raw-render ` to pass a ` raw ` instead of a
string:



    #raw-render(
      ```dot
      digraph {
        a -> b
      }
      ```
    )


![raw-
render](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robotechnic/diagraph/main/images/raw-
render1.png)

For more information about the Graphviz Dot language, you can check the [
official documentation ](https://graphviz.org/documentation/) .

===  Advanced usage

= *lineal.md*

=  lineal

0.1.0

Build elegent slide decks with Typst

IPA: /ËlÉªniÉl/

Made up of, or having the characteristic of, lines.

Lineal is a Typst template for generating beautifully clean and configurably
awesome slides.

![Demo slide
deck](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lineal/0.1.0/assets/img/demo.gif)

==  Philosophy

As a long time user of TeX, I have developed and embedded countless LaTeX
applications into personal and corporate environments, e.g. automating
documentation, conference materials, posters, resumes, etc.

However, LaTeX is showing its age. Compiling a some 30-slide presentation, for
instance, takes perhaps a second, and may requires multiple renders to sync
TikZ positioning and cross-document referencing. Typst remediates these issues
in real-time and with better control and confidence in its data modelling.

Hence, Lineal was born. A professional set of slides produced near instantly,
readily equipped with configurable theming and a suite of flexible components.

==  Usage

Lineal is available through Typst Universe. Ensure you have installed Typst
locally or are familiar with the Typst [ web app ](https://typst.app/) or the
[ Tinymist LSP ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-
dreamin.tinymist) extensions for VS Code.

Get started by importing the package and populating your own `
/content/<slug>.typ ` files:



    #import "@preview/lineal:0.1.0": lineal-theme

    #show: lineal-theme.with(
      aspect-ratio: "16-9",
      config-info(
        title: [$bb("L")"ineal"$],
        subtitle: [A Typst slide template],
        author: [Author],
        date: datetime.today(),
        institution: [Institution],
        logo: [Logo],
      ),
    )

    #title-slide()

    #include "content/index.typ"


Marking up content is as you would with any other Typst document, where the
section ( ` = <section-title> ` ) and subsection ( ` == <slide-title> ` )
shorthands generate the new section slides with dynamic outline and new
tracked slides respectively.

==  Contributing

PRs are very welcome. If you think Lineal could be improved in any way or is
missing a feature, please raise a request ð

==  Acknowledgements

A heartfelt thank you to the team behind [ Typst
](https://github.com/typst/typst) , developing a product that not only
preserves the beauty of LaTeXâs typesetting, but improves on its developer
experience in every way, in line with ongoing community feedback.

The creators of the [ ` Touying ` ](https://github.com/touying-typ/touying)
and [ ` Polylux ` ](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/polylux) Typst

==  Quickstart

For the bare-bones, do-it-yourself experience, all you need is:



    // Get Polylux from the official package repository
    #import "@preview/polylux:0.3.1": *

    // Make the paper dimensions fit for a presentation and the text larger
    #set page(paper: "presentation-16-9")
    #set text(size: 25pt)

    // Use #polylux-slide to create a slide and style it using your favourite Typst functions
    #polylux-slide[
      #align(horizon + center)[
        = Very minimalist slides

        A lazy author

        July 23, 2023
      ]
    ]

    #polylux-slide[
      == First slide

      Some static text on this slide.
    ]

    #polylux-slide[
      == This slide changes!

      You can always see this.
      // Make use of features like #uncover, #only, and others to create dynamic content
      #uncover(2)[But this appears later!]
    ]


This code produces these PDF pages: ![minimal
example](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/minimal.png)

From there, you can either start creatively adapting the looks to your likings
or you can use one of the provided themes. The simplest one of them is called
` simple ` (what a coincidence!). It is still very unintrusive but gives you
some sensible defaults:



    #import "@preview/polylux:0.3.1": *

    #import themes.simple: *

    #set text(font: "Inria Sans")

    #show: simple-theme.with(
      footer: [Simple slides],
    )

    #title-slide[
      = Keep it simple!

    ]

    #slide[

As you can see, a theme can introduce its own types of slides (here: ` title-
slide ` , ` slide ` , ` focus-slide ` , ` centered-slide ` ) to let you
quickly switch between different layouts. The book [ has more infos
](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/themes/themes.html) on how
to use (and create your own) themes.

For dynamic content, Polylux also provides [ a convenient API for complex
overlays
](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/dynamic/dynamic.html) .

If you use [ pdfpc ](https://pdfpc.github.io/) to display your slides, you can
rely on [ Polyluxâ support for it
](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/external/pdfpc.html) and
create speaker notes, hide slides, configure the timer and more!

Visit the [ book ](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book) for more
details or take a look at the [ demo PDF
](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/polylux/releases/latest/download/demo.pdf)
where you can see the features of this template in action.

= *boxr.md*

=  boxr

0.1.0

A modular, and easy to use, package for creating cardboard cutouts in Typst.

Boxr is a modular, and easy to use, package for creating cardboard cutouts in
Typst.

==  Usage

Create a boxr structure in your project with the following code:



    #import "@preview/boxr:0.1.0": *

    #render-structure(
      "box",
      width: 100pt,
      height: 100pt,
      depth: 100pt,
      tab-size: 20pt,
      [
        Hello from boxr!
      ]
    )


The ` render-structure ` function is the main function for boxr. It either
takes a path to one of the default structures provided by boxr (e.g.: ` "box"
` ) or an unpacked json file with your own custom structure (e.g.: ` json(my-
structure.json) ` ). These describe the structure of the cutout.
The other named arguments depend on the structure you are rendering. All
unnamed arguments are passed to the structure as content and will be rendered
on each box face (not triangles or tabs).

==  Creating your own structures

Structures are defined in ` .json ` files. An example structure that just
shows a box with a tab on one face is shown below:



    {
      "variables": ["height", "width", "tab-size"],
      "width": "width",
      "height": "height + tab-size",
      "offset-x": "",
      "offset-y": "tab-size",
      "root": {
        "type": "box",
        "id": 0,
        "width": "width",
        "height": "height",
        "children": {
          "top": "tab(tab-size, tab-size)"
        }
      }
    }


The ` variables ` key is a list of variable names that can be passed to the
structure. These will be required to be passed to the ` render-structure `
function.
The ` width ` and ` height ` keys are evaluated to calculate the width and
height of the structure.
The ` offset-x ` and ` offset-y ` keys are evaluated to place the structure in
the middle of its bounds. It is relative to the root node. In this case for
example, the top tab adds a ` tab-size ` on top of the box as opposed to the
bottom, where there is no tab. So this ` tab-size ` is added to the ` offset-y
` .
` root ` denotes the first node in the structure.
A node can be of the following types:

  - ` box ` :
    - The root node has a ` width ` and a ` height ` . All following nodes have a ` size ` . Child nodes use ` size ` and the parent nodeâs ` width ` and ` height ` to calculate their own width and height.
    - Can have ` children ` nodes.
    - Can have an ` id ` key that is used to place content on the face of the box. The id-th unnamed argument is placed on the face. Multiple faces can have the same id.
    - Can have a ` no-fold ` key. If this exists, no fold stroke will be drawn between this box and its parent.
  - ` triangle-<left|right> ` :
    - Has a ` width ` and ` height ` .
    - ` left ` and ` right ` denote the direction the other right angled line is facing relative to the base.
    - Can have ` children ` nodes.
    - Can have a ` no-fold ` key. If this exists, no fold stroke will be drawn between this triangle and its parent.
  - ` tab ` :
    - Is not a json object, but a string that denotes a tab. The tab is placed on the parent node.
    - Has a tab-size and a cutin-size inside the ` () ` separted by a ` , ` .
  - ` none ` :
    - Is not a json object, but a string that denotes no node. This is useful for deleting a cut-stroke between two nodes.

Every string value in the json file ( ` width: "__", height: "__", ... offset-x/y: "__" ` and the values between the ` | ` for tabs) is evaluated as regular typst code. This means that you can use all named variables passed to the structure. All inputs are converted to points and the result of the evaluation will be converted back to a length.

thesis/0.1.0/thumbnails/2.png)
![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/parcio-
thesis/0.1.0/thumbnails/3.png)

A simple thesis template based on the ParCIO working group at Otto-von-
Guericke University Magdeburg.

==  Getting Started

To use this template, simply import it as shown below (more options under `
Usage ` ):



    #import "@preview/parcio-thesis:0.1.0": *

    #show: parcio.with(
      title: "My great thesis",
      author: (
        name: "Author",
        mail: "author@ovgu.de"
      ),
      abstract: [My abstract begins here.],
    )


===  Local Installation

Following these steps will make the template available locally under the `
@local ` namespace. Requires [ âJust - A Command Runnerâ
](https://github.com/casey/just) .



    git clone git@github.com:xkevio/parcio-typst.git
    cd parcio-typst/parcio-thesis/
    just install


==  Usage

See here for *all* possible arguments (and their default values) and utility
functions:



    #import "@preview/parcio-thesis:0.1.0": *

    #show: parcio.with(
      title: "Title",
      author: (name: "Author", mail: "author@ovgu.de"),
      abstract: [],
      thesis-type: "Bachelor/Master",
      reviewers: (),
      date: datetime.today(),
      lang: "en",
      header-logo: none,
      translations: none,
    )

    // Use these to _enable_ or _change_ page numbering for your frontmatter and mainmatter respectively.
    // (By default, this template hides the page numbering!)
    #show: roman-numbering.with(reset: <true|false>)
    #show: arabic-numbering.with(alternate: <true|false>, reset: <true|false>)


===  Utility Functions

These could be useful while writing your thesis!



    // A TODO marker. (inline: false -> margin note, inline: true -> box).
    #let todo(inline: false, body)

    // Like \section* in LaTeX. (unnumbered level 2 heading, not in ToC).
    #let section = heading.with(level: 2, outlined: false, numbering: none)

    // A neat inline-section in smallcaps and sans font.
    #let inline-section(title) = smallcaps[_#text(font: "Libertinus Sans", title)_]

    // Fully empty page, no page numbering.
    #let empty-page = page([], footer: [])

    // Subfigures (see chapters/introduction for syntax).
    #let subfigure(..)

    // A ParCIO-like table with a design taken from the LaTeX template.
    #let parcio-table(max-rows, ..args)

    // Nicer handling of (multiple) appendices. Specify `reset: true` with your first appendix to reset the heading counter!
    #let appendix(reset: false, label: none, body)


===  Translations

If you wish, you can provide custom translations for things like
âSectionâ, âContentsâ, etc. by providing a custom ` translations.toml
` (this template already comes with translations for English and German) with
the following schema:



    # Top-level dict name should follow ISO 639 language codes!
    default-lang = "en"

    [de]
    contents = "Inhaltsverzeichnis"
    chapter = "Kapitel"
    section = "Sektion"
    thesis = { value = "Arbeit", compound = true }

    [de.title-page]
    first-reviewer = "Erstgutachter"
    second-reviewer = "Zweitgutachter"
    supervisor = "Betreuer"

    [de.bibliography]
    bibliography = "Quellenverzeichnis"
    cited-on-page = "Zitiert auf Seite"
    cited-on-pages = "Zitiert auf Seiten"
    join = "und"

    [de.date]
    date-format = "[day]. [month repr:long] [year]"
    months = ["Januar", "Februar", "MÃ¤rz", "April", "Mai", "Juni", "Juli", "August", "September", "Oktober", "November", "Dezember"]


==  Fonts and OvGU Corporate Design

This template requires these three fonts to be installed on your system[^1]:

  - Libertinus Serif ( [ https://github.com/alerque/libertinus ](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus) )
  - Libertinus Sans ( [ https://github.com/alerque/libertinus ](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus) )
  - Inconsolata ( [ https://github.com/googlefonts/Inconsolata ](https://github.com/googlefonts/Inconsolata) )

We bundle the default âFaculty of Computer Scienceâ head banner and use it
as the ` header-logo ` . You can find yours at: [
https://www.cd.ovgu.de/FakultÃ¤ten.html
](https://www.cd.ovgu.de/Fakult%C3%A4ten.html) .

[^1]: Typst should already provide the Libertinus font family by default as it
is their standard font.

= *based.md*

=  based

0.2.0

Encoder and decoder for base64, base32, and base16.

A package for encoding and decoding in base64, base32, and base16.

==  Usage

The package comes with three submodules: ` base64 ` , ` base32 ` , and `
base16 ` . All of them have an ` encode ` and ` decode ` function. The package
also provides the function aliases

  - ` encode64 ` / ` decode64 ` ,
  - ` encode32 ` / ` decode32 ` , and
  - ` encode16 ` / ` decode16 ` .

Both base64 and base32 allow you to choose whether to use padding for encoding
via the ` pad ` parameter, which is enabled by default. Base64 also allows you
to encode with the URL-safe alphabet by enabling the ` url ` parameter, while
base32 allows you to encode or decode with the âextended hexâ alphabet via
the ` hex ` parameter. Both options are disabled by default. The base16
encoder uses lowercase letters, the decoder is case-insensitive.

You can encode strings, arrays and bytes. The ` encode ` function will return
a string, while the ` decode ` function will return bytes.

==  Example



    #import "@preview/based:0.2.0": base64, base32, base16

    #table(
      columns: 3,

      table.header[*Base64*][*Base32*][*Base16*],

      raw(base64.encode("Hello world!")),
      raw(base32.encode("Hello world!")),
      raw(base16.encode("Hello world!")),

      str(base64.decode("SGVsbG8gd29ybGQh")),
      str(base32.decode("JBSWY3DPEB3W64TMMQQQ====")),
      str(base16.decode("48656C6C6F20776F726C6421"))

=  blind-cvpr

0.5.0

CVPR-style paper template to publish at the Computer Vision and Pattern
Recognition (CVPR) conferences.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=blind-cvpr&version=0.5.0)

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking _Start from
template_ on the dashboard and searching for ` blind-cvpr ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/blind-cvpr


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` cvpr2022 ` and ` cvpr2025 ` styling rule with the
following named arguments.

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` authors ` : An array of author dictionaries. Each of the author dictionaries must have a name key and can have the keys department, organization, location, and email.
  - ` keywords ` : Publication keywords (used in PDF metadata).
  - ` date ` : Creation date (used in PDF metadata).
  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or none. Appears at the top under the title.
  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the bibliography function or none. The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the paper.
  - ` appendix ` : Content to append after bibliography section.
  - ` accepted ` : If this is set to ` false ` then anonymized ready for submission document is produced; ` accepted: true ` produces camera-redy version. If the argument is set to ` none ` then preprint version is produced (can be uploaded to arXiv).
  - ` id ` : Identifier of a submission.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` cvpr2025
` function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use
this template, you can add a show rule at the top of your file.

        then begin the main text. Look at previous CVPR abstracts to get a feel for
        style and length.
      ],
      bibliography: bibliography("main.bib"),
      accepted: false,
      id: none,
    )


==  Issues

  - In case of US Letter, column sizes + gap does not equals to text width (2 * 3.25 + 5/16 != 6 + 7/8). It seems that correct gap should be 3/8.

  - At the moment of Typst v0.11.0, it is impossible to indent the first paragraph in a section (see [ typst/typst#311 ](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/311) ). The workaround is to add indentation manually as follows.

        == H2

    #h(12pt)  Manually as space for the first paragraph.
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do.

    // The second one is just fine.
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do.


Also, we add ` indent ` constant as a shortcut for ` h(12pt) ` .

This issue is relevant to CVPR 2022. In the 2025 template there is no
indentaino of the first paragraph in section.

  - At the moment Typst v0.11.0 does not allow flexible customization of citation styles. Specifically, CVPR 2022 citation lookes like ` [42] ` where number is colored hyperlink. In order to achive this, we shouuld provide custom CSL-style and then colorize number and put it into square parenthesis in typst markup.

  - CVPR 2022 requires simple ruler which enumerates lines in regular intervals whilst CVPR2025 already requires a ruler which add line numers per line in paragraph or heading. Thus we need the next major Typst release v0.12.0 for ruler. With the next Typst release, we can do the following.

        set par.line(numbering: "1")
    show figure: set par.line(numbering: none)


For implementation details see [ typst/typst#4516
](https://github.com/typst/typst/pull/4516) .

  - CVPR 2022 and 2025 requires IEEE-like bibliography style but does not follow its guidelines closely. Since writing CSL-style files is tedious task, we adopt close enough bibliography style from Zotero.

0.2.4

Configurable figure and equation numbering per section.

Configurable figure numbering per section.

==  Examples

===  Basic

Have a look at the source [ here
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/i-figured/0.2.4/examples/basic.typ)
.

![Example:
basic](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/i-figured/0.2.4/examples/basic.png)

===  Two levels deep

Have a look at the source [ here
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/i-figured/0.2.4/examples/level-
two.typ) .

![Example: two levels
deep](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/i-figured/0.2.4/examples/level-
two.png)

==  Usage

The package mainly consists of two customizable show rules, which set up all
the numbering. There is also an additional function to make showing an outline
of figures easier.

Because the [ ` show-figure() `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/i-figured/0.2.4/#show-
figure) function must internally create another figure element, attached
labels cannot directly be used for references. To circumvent this, a new label
is attached to the internal figure, with the same name but prefixed with `
fig: ` , ` tbl: ` , or ` lst: ` for images (and all other types of generic
figures), tables, and raw code figures (aka listings) respectively. These new
labels can be used for referencing without problems.



    // import the package
    #import "@preview/i-figured:0.2.4"

    // make sure you have some heading numbering set
    #set heading(numbering: "1.")

    // apply the show rules (these can be customized)
    #show heading: i-figured.reset-counters
    #show figure: i-figured.show-figure

    // show an outline
    #i-figured.outline()

    = Hello World

    #figure([hi], caption: [Bye World.]) <bye>

    // when referencing, the label names must be prefixed with `fig:`, `tbl:`,
    // or `lst:` depending on the figure kind.
    @fig:bye displays the text "hi".


==  Reference

===  ` reset-counters `

Reset all figure counters. To be used in a heading show rule like ` #show
heading: i-figured.reset-counters ` .



    #let reset-counters(
      it,
      level: 1,
      extra-kinds: (),
      equations: true,
      return-orig-heading: true,
    ) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` it ` : [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The heading element from the show rule.
  - ` level ` : [ ` int ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/int/) â At which heading level to reset the counters. A value of ` 2 ` will cause the counters to be reset at level two _and_ level one headings.
  - ` extra-kinds ` : [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) of ( [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or [ ` function ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/) ) â Additional custom figure kinds. If you have any figures with a ` kind ` other than ` image ` , ` table ` , or ` raw ` , you must add the ` kind ` here for its counter to be reset.
  - ` equations ` : [ ` bool ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) â Whether the counter for math equations should be reset.
  - ` return-orig-heading ` : [ ` bool ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) â Whether the original heading element should be included in the returned content. Set this to false if you manually want to construct a heading instead of using the default.

*Returns:* [ ` content `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The unmodified
heading.

===  ` show-figure `

Show a figure with per-section numbering. To be used in a figure show rule
like ` #show figure: i-figured.show-figure ` .



    #let show-figure(
      it,
      level: 1,
      zero-fill: true,
      leading-zero: true,
      numbering: "1.1",
      extra-prefixes: (:),
      fallback-prefix: "fig:",
    ) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` it ` : [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The figure element from the show rule.
  - ` level ` : [ ` int ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/int/) â How many levels of the current heading counter should be added in front. Note that you can control this individually from the ` level ` parameter on [ ` reset-counters() ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/i-figured/0.2.4/#reset-counters) .
  - ` zero-fill ` : [ ` bool ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) â If ` true ` and assuming a ` level ` of ` 2 ` , a figure after a ` 1. ` heading but before a ` 1.1. ` heading will show ` 1.0.1 ` as numbering, else the middle zero is excluded. Note that if set to ` false ` , not all figure numberings are guaranteed to have the same length.
  - ` leading-zero ` : [ ` bool ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) â Whether figures before the first top-level heading should have a leading ` 0 ` . Note that if set to ` false ` , not all figure numberings are guaranteed to have the same length.
  - ` numbering ` : [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or [ ` function ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/) â The actual numbering pattern to use for the figures.
  - ` extra-prefixes ` : [ ` dictionary ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/) of [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) to [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) pairs â Additional label prefixes. This can optionally be used to specify prefixes for custom figure kinds, otherwise they will also use the fallback prefix.
  - ` fallback-prefix ` : [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) â The label prefix to use for figure kinds which donât have another prefix set.

*Returns:* [ ` content `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The modified
figure.

===  ` show-equation `

Show a math equation with per-section numbering. To be used in a show rule
like ` #show math.equation: i-figured.show-equation ` .



    #let show-equation(
      it,
      level: 1,
      zero-fill: true,
      leading-zero: true,
      numbering: "(1.1)",
      prefix: "eqt:",
      only-labeled: false,
      unnumbered-label: "-",
    ) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

For the arguments ` level ` , ` zero-fill ` , ` leading-zero ` , and `
numbering ` refer to [ ` show-figure() `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/i-figured/0.2.4/#show-
figure) .

  - ` it ` : [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The equation element from the show rule.
  - ` prefix ` : [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) â The label prefix to use for all equations.
  - ` only-labeled ` : [ ` bool ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) â Whether only equations with labels should be numbered.
  - ` unnumbered-label ` : [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) â A label to explicitly disable numbering for an equation.

*Returns:* [ ` content `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The modified
equation.

===  ` outline `

Show the outline for a kind of figure. This is just the same as calling `
outline(target: figure.where(kind: i-figured._prefix + repr(target-kind)), ..)
` , the function just exists for convenience and clarity.



    #let outline(target-kind: image, title: [List of Figures], ..args) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` target-kind ` : [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or [ ` function ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/) â Which kind of figure to list.
  - ` title ` : [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) or ` none ` â The title of the outline.
  - ` ..args ` â Other arguments to pass to the underlying [ ` outline() ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/) call.

*Returns:* [ ` content `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The outline
element.

0.1.0

Serialization module for Typst

serialize the Typst objects into bytes and deserialize the bytes into Typst
objects

==  Reason

I want to interactive between the wasm and typst. But I found that the input
arguments and output argument are all bytes. It is not convenient for me to
use WASM. So I designed the serialization protocol and implemented this
serialization module for reference.

Although there have been some serialization APIs like cbor, yaml, json and
others, this is a good learning material and a good example to show the
abilities of Typst.

==  Example

Have a look at the example [ here
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/yats/0.1.0/example.typ)
.

==  Usage

Simply import 2 functions : ` serialize ` , ` deserialize ` .

And enjoy it



    #import "@preview/yats:0.1.0": serialize, deserialize
    #{
      let obj = (
        name : "0warning0error",
        age : 100,
        height : 1.8,
        birthday : datetime(year : 1998,month : 7,day:8)
      )
      deserialize(serialize(obj))
    }


==  Supported Types

  - ` none `
  - ` bool `
  - ` type ` : type is a type
  - ` int `
  - ` float ` : (implemented in string, for convenience)
  - ` datetime ` : only support ` year ` , ` month ` , ` day ` ; ` hour ` , ` minute ` , ` second ` ; both combined.
  - ` duration `
  - ` bytes `
  - ` string `
  - ` regex ` : (dealing with it is a little tricky)
  - ` array ` : the element in it can be anything listed.
  - ` dictionary ` : the value in it can be anything listed.

==  ` Yats ` function



    #let serialize(
      data : any
    ) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` data ` : [ ` any ` ] â Any supported object .

*Return*

The serialized bytes.



    #let deserialize(
      data : array
    ) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` data ` : [ ` bytes ` ] â serialized objects represented by bytes .

*Return*

binary array. (the first one is the object deserialized, the second one is the
valid length of the bytes)

==  Potential Problems and limitation

  - Some problem can be caused by changes of ` repr ` . For example, the serialization of ` regex ` relies on the ` repr ` of ` regex ` . And there are no method to directly catch the inner ` string ` .

  - Because of lack of time, only basic types are supported. But more types can be supported in Typst.

0.3.1

Convert Chinese text between Traditional/Simplified and regional variants.
ä¸­æç®ç¹åå°åè©è½æ

zhconv-typst converts Chinese text between Traditional, Simplified and
regional variants in typst, utilizing [ zhconv-rs
](https://github.com/Gowee/zhconv-rs) .

==  Usage

To use the ` zhconv ` plugin in your Typst project, import it as follows:



    #import "@preview/zhconv:0.3.1": zhconv


===  Text Conversion

The primary function provided by this package is ` zhconv ` , which converts
strings or nested contents to a target Chinese variant.



    #zhconv(content, "target-variant", wikitext: false)


  - ` content ` : The text or content to be converted.
  - ` target-variant ` : The target Chinese variant (e.g., ` "zh-hant" ` , ` "zh-hans" ` , ` "zh-cn" ` , ` "zh-tw" ` , ` "zh-hk" ` ).
  - ` wikitext ` : An optional boolean flag to specify if the text should be processed as wikitext (default is ` false ` ).

====  Example

=====  Convert a string



    #let text = "äºèç½"
    Original: #text
    - #emph([zh-HK]): #zhconv(text, "zh-hk")
    - #emph([zh-TW]): #zhconv(text, "zh-tw")


=====  Convert nested contents



    #zhconv([
    æ³å¤è¼é·æ± ä¸é¨ \
    é¨è²æ»´ç¢è·è² \

    å°æ¨è¥¿è§æ·è¹æ \
    éå¹²åè \
    å¾å¾æè¯ç \
    ], "zh-hans")


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` zhconv `

0.5.3

Hand Picked Index for Typst.

Automatically create a handcrafted index in [ typst ](https://typst.app/) .
This typst component allows the automatic creation of an Index page with
entries that have been manually marked in the document by its authors. This,
in times of advanced search functionality, seems somewhat outdated, but a
handcrafted index like this allows the authors to point the reader to just the
right location in the document.

â ï¸ Typst is in beta and evolving, and this package evolves with it. As a
result, no backward compatibility is guaranteed yet. Also, the package itself
is under development and fine-tuning.

==  Usage

==  Importing the Component

To use the index functionality, the component must be available. This can be
achieved by importing the package ` in-dexter ` into the project:

Add the following code to the head of the document file(s) that want to use
the index:



      #import "@preview/in-dexter:0.5.3": *


Alternatively it can be loaded from the file, if you have it copied into your
project.



      #import "in-dexter.typ": *


==  Remarks for new version

In previous versions (before 0.0.6) of in-dexter, it was required to hide the
index entries with a show rule. This is not required anymore.

==  Marking Entries

To mark a word to be included in the index, a simple function can be used. In
the following sample code, the word âelitâ is marked to be included into
the index.



    = Sample Text
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing #index[elit], sed do eiusmod tempor
    incididunt ut labore et dolore.


Nested entries can be created - the following would create an entry `
adipiscing ` with sub entry ` elit ` .



    = Sample Text
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit#index("adipiscing", "elit"), sed do eiusmod
    tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore.


The marking, by default, is invisible in the resulting text, while the marked
word will still be visible. With the marking in place, the index component
knows about the word, as well as its location in the document.

==  Generating the Index Page

The index page can be generated by the following function:



    = Index
    #columns(3)[
      #make-index(title: none)
    ]


This sample uses the optional title, outline, and use-page-counter parameters:



    #make-index(title: [Index], outlined: true, use-page-counter: true)


The ` make-index() ` function takes three optional arguments: ` title ` , `
outlined ` , and ` use-page-counter ` .

  - ` title ` adds a title (with ` heading ` ) and
  - ` outlined ` is ` false ` by default and is passed to the heading function
  - ` use-page-counter ` is ` false ` by default. If set to ` true ` it will use ` counter(page).display() ` for the page number text in the index instead of the absolute page position (the absolute position is still used for the actual link target)

If no title is given the heading should never appear in the layout. Note: The
heading is (currently) not numbered.

The first sample emits the index in three columns. Note: The actual appearance
depends on your template or other settings of your document.

You can find a preview image of the resulting page on [ in-dexterÂ´s GitHub
repository ](https://github.com/RolfBremer/in-dexter) .

You may have noticed that some page numbers are displayed as bold. These are
index entries which are marked as âmainâ entries. Such entries are meant
to be the most important for the given entry. They can be marked as follows:



    #index(fmt: strong, [Willkommen])


or you can use the predefined semantically helper function



    #index-main[Willkommen]


===  Brief Sample Document

This is a very brief sample to demonstrate how in-dexter can be used. The next
chapter contains a more fleshed out sample.



    #import "@preview/in-dexter:0.5.3": *


    = My Sample Document with `in-dexter`

    In this document the usage of the `in-dexter` package is demonstrated to create
    a hand picked #index[Hand Picked] index. This sample #index-main[Sample]
    document #index[Document] is quite short, and so is its index.


    = Index

    This section contains the generated Index.

    #make-index()


===  Full Sample Document



    #import "@preview/in-dexter:0.5.3": *

    #let index-main(..args) = index(fmt: strong, ..args)

    // Document settings
    #set page("a5")
    #set text(font: ("Arial", "Trebuchet MS"), size: 12pt)


    = My Sample Document with `in-dexter`

    In this document #index[Document] the usage of the `in-dexter` package #index[Package]
    is demonstrated to create a hand picked index #index-main[Index]. This sample document
    is quite short, and so is its index. So to fill this sample with some real text,
    letÂ´s elaborate on some aspects of a hand picked #index[Hand Picked] index. So, "hand
    picked" means, the entries #index[Entries] in the index are carefully chosen by the
    author(s) of the document to point the reader, who is interested in a specific topic
    within the documents domain #index[Domain], to the right spot #index[Spot]. Thats, how
    it should be; and it is quite different to what is done in this sample text, where the
    objective #index-main[Objective] was to put many different index markers
    #index[Markers] into a small text, because a sample should be as brief as possible,
    while providing enough substance #index[Substance] to demo the subject
    #index[Subject]. The resulting index in this demo is somewhat pointless
    #index[Pointless], because all entries are pointing to few different pages
    #index[Pages], due to the fact that the demo text only has few pages #index[Page].
    That is also the reason for what we chose the DIN A5 #index[DIN A5] format, and we
    also continue with some remarks #index[Remarks] on the next page.


    == Some more demo content without deeper meaning

    #lorem(50) #index[Lorem]

    #pagebreak()

    == Remarks

    Here are some more remarks #index-main[Remarks] to have some content on a second page, what
    is a precondition #index[Precondition] to demo that Index #index[Index] entries
    #index[Entries] may point to multiple pages.


    = Index

    This section #index[Section] contains the generated Index #index[Index], in a nice
    two-column-layout.

    #set text(size: 10pt)
    #columns(2)[
        #make-index()
    ]


The following image shows a generated index page of another document, with
additional formatting for headers applied.

  - fix error in typst.toml file.
  - Add a sample for raw display.

===  v0.5.2

  - Fix a bug with bang notation.
  - Add compiler to toml file.

===  v0.5.1

  - Migrate deprecated locate to context.

===  v0.5.0

  - Support page numbering formats (i.e. roman), when ` use-page-counter ` is set to true. Thanks to @ThePuzzlemaker!

===  v0.4.3

  - Suppress extra space character emitted by the ` index() ` function.
  - Fix a bug where math formulas are not displayed.
  - Introduce ` apply-casing ` parameter to ` index() ` to suppress entry-casing for individual entries.

===  v0.4.2

  - Improve internal method ` as-text ` to be more robust.
  - tidy up sample-usage.typ.

===  v0.4.1

  - Bug fixed: Fix a bug where an index entry with same name as a group hides the group.
  - Fixed typos in the sample-usage document.

===  v0.4.0

  - Support for a ` display ` parameter for entries. This allows the usage of complex content, like math expressions in the index. (based on suggestions by @lukasjuhrich)
  - Also support a tuple value for display and key parameters of the entry.
  - Improve internal robustness and fix some errors in the sample document.

===  v0.3.2

  - Fix initial parsing and returning fist letter (thanks to @lukasjuhrich, #14)

===  v0.3.1

===  v0.3.0

  - Support multiple named indexes. Also allow the generation of combined index pages.
  - Support for LaTeX index group syntax ( ` #index("Group1!Group2@Entry" ` ).
  - Support for advanced case handling for the entries in the index. Note: The new default ist to ignore the casing for the sorting of the entries. The behavior can be changed by providing a ` sort-order() ` function to the ` make-index ` function.
  - The casing for the index entry can also be altered by providing a ` entry-casing() ` function to the ` make-index ` function. So it is possible that all entries have an uppercase first letter (which is also the new default!).

===  v0.2.0

  - Allow index to respect unnumbered physical pages at the start of the document (Thanks to @jewelpit). See âSkipping physical pagesâ in the sample-usage document.

===  v0.1.0

  - Implemented:
    - nested entries.
    - custom initials + custom sorting.

===  v0.0.6

  - Change internal index marker to use metadata instead of figures. This allows a cleaner implementation and does not require a show rule to hide the marker-figure anymore.
  - This version requires Typst 0.8.0 due to the use of metadata().
  - Consolidated the ` PackageReadme.md ` into a single ` README.md ` .

===  v0.0.5

  - Address change in ` figure.caption ` in typst (commit: 976abdf ).

===  v0.0.4

  - Add title and outline arguments to #make-index() by @sbatial in #4

template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/bloated-
neurips-0.5.1-small.webp)

=  bloated-neurips

0.5.1

NeurIPS-style paper template to publish at the Conference and Workshop on
Neural Information Processing Systems

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=bloated-neurips&version=0.5.1)

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking _Start from
template_ on the dashboard and searching for ` bloated-neurips ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/bloated-neurips


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` neurips2023 ` and ` neurips2024 ` function with
the following named arguments.

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` authors ` : An array of author dictionaries. Each of the author dictionaries must have a name key and can have the keys department, organization, location, and email.
  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or none. Appears at the top under the title.
  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the bibliography function or none. The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the paper.
  - ` appendix ` : A content which is placed after bibliography.
  - ` accepted ` : If this is set to ` false ` then anonymized ready for submission document is produced; ` accepted: true ` produces camera-redy version. If the argument is set to ` none ` then preprint version is produced (can be uploaded to arXiv).

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the `
neurips2024 ` function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing
project to use this template, you can add a show rule at the top of your file
as follows.



    #import "@preview/bloated-neurips:0.5.1": neurips2024

    #show: neurips2024.with(
      title: [Formatting Instructions For NeurIPS 2024],
      authors: (authors, affls),
      keywords: ("Machine Learning", "NeurIPS"),
      abstract: [
        The abstract paragraph should be indented Â½ inch (3 picas) on both the
        left- and right-hand margins. Use 10 point type, with a vertical spacing
        (leading) of 11 points. The word *Abstract* must be centered, bold, and in
        point size 12. Two line spaces precede the abstract. The abstract must be
        limited to one paragraph.
      ],
      bibliography: bibliography("main.bib"),
      appendix: [
        #include "appendix.typ"
        #include "checklist.typ"
      ],
      accepted: false,
    )

    #lorem(42)


With template of version v0.5.1 or newer, one can override some parts.
Specifically, ` get-notice ` entry of ` aux ` directory parameter of show rule
allows to adjust the NeurIPS 2024 template to Science4DL workshop as follows.



    #import "@preview/bloated-neurips:0.5.1": neurips

    #let get-notice(accepted) = if accepted == none {
      return [Preprint. Under review.]
    } else if accepted {
      return [
        Workshop on Scientific Methods for Understanding Deep Learning, NeurIPS
        2024.
      ]
    } else {
      return [
        Submitted to Workshop on Scientific Methods for Understanding Deep
        Learning, NeurIPS 2024.
      ]
    }

    #let science4dl2024(
      title: [], authors: (), keywords: (), date: auto, abstract: none,
      bibliography: none, appendix: none, accepted: false, body,
    ) = {
      show: neurips.with(
        title: title,
        authors: authors,
        keywords: keywords,
        date: date,
        abstract: abstract,
        accepted: false,
        aux: (get-notice: get-notice),
      )
      body
    }


==  Issues

  - The biggest and the most important issues is related to line ruler. We are not aware of universal method for numbering lines in the main body of a paper. Fortunately, line numbering support has been implemented at [ typst/typst#4516 ](https://github.com/typst/typst/pull/4516) . Letâs wait for the next major release v0.12.0!

  - There is an issue in Typst with spacing between figures and between figure with floating placement. The issue is that there is no way to specify gap between subsequent figures. In order to have behaviour similar to original LaTeX template, one should consider direct spacing adjacemnt with ` v(-1em) ` as follows.

        #figure(
      rect(width: 4.25cm, height: 4.25cm, stroke: 0.4pt),
      caption: [Sample figure caption.#v(-1em)],
      placement: top,
    )
    #figure(
      rect(width: 4.25cm, height: 4.25cm, stroke: 0.4pt),
      caption: [Sample figure caption.],
      placement: top,
    )


  - Another issue is related to Typstâs inablity to produce colored annotation. In order to mitigte the issue, we add a script which modifies annotations and make them colored.

        ../colorize-annotations.py \
        example-paper.typst.pdf example-paper-colored.typst.pdf


See [ README.md ](https://github.com/daskol/typst-templates/#colored-
annotations) for details.

  - NeurIPS 2023/2024 instructions discuss bibliography in vague terms. Namely, there is not specific requirements. Thus we stick to ` ieee ` bibliography style since we found it in several accepted papers and it is similar to that in the example paper.

  - It is unclear how to render notice in the bottom of the title page in case of final ( ` accepted: true ` ) or preprint ( ` accepted: none ` ) submission.

"@preview/plotst:0.2.0": * ` . The documentation is found in the [ Docs.pdf
](https://github.com/Pegacraft/typst-
plotting/blob/8d834689359b708ce75fe51be05eed45570e463e/docs/Docs.pdf) file. It
contains all functions necessary to use this library. It also includes a
tutorial to create every available plot under their respective render methods.

If you need some example code, check out [ main.typ
](https://github.com/Pegacraft/typst-
plotting/blob/8d834689359b708ce75fe51be05eed45570e463e/example/main.typ) . It
also includes a [ compiled version ](https://github.com/Pegacraft/typst-
plotting/blob/8d834689359b708ce75fe51be05eed45570e463e/example/Plotting.pdf) .

==  Examples:

All these images were created using the [ main.typ
](https://github.com/Pegacraft/typst-
plotting/blob/8d834689359b708ce75fe51be05eed45570e463e/example/main.typ) .

===  Scatter plots

= *ttt-utils.md*

=  ttt-utils

0.1.2

A collection of tools to make a teachers life easier.

` ttt-utils ` is the core package of the [ typst-teacher-tools collection
](https://github.com/jomaway/typst-teacher-templates) .

==  Modules

It contains several modules:

  - ` assignments ` contains functions for creating exams.
  - ` components ` contains useful visual components such _lines_ or _caro pattern_ , _tags_ , etc â¦
  - ` grading ` contains functions for grading exams.
  - ` helpers ` contains some utility functions.
  - ` layout ` contains some layout functions such as _side-by-side_ , etcâ¦
  - ` random ` contains a function to shuffle an array.

==  Usage

You can import the modules you need with:



    #import "@preview/ttt-utils:0.1.0": components


then you can access the modules function with:

` #components.lines(4) ` or ` #components.caro(5) ` , â¦

or import the wanted functions:



    #import "@preview/ttt-utils:0.1.0": components, assignments

    #import assignments: assignment, question, answer
    #import components: caro as grid_pattern

    // Add a question.

    #assignment[First assignment

        #question[
            #answer(field: grid_pattern(5))
        ]
    ]



==  Similar projects

  - [ scrutinize ](https://github.com/SillyFreak/typst-packages/tree/main/scrutinize) by [ SillyFreak ](https://github.com/SillyFreak) : Package to create exams, very similar to the ` assignment ` module, but only questions without assignments, and a bit more low level. I adopted a few of his ideas.

= *pyrunner.md*

=  pyrunner

0.2.0

Run python code in typst.

Run python code in [ typst ](https://typst.app/) using [ RustPython
](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython) .



    #import "@preview/pyrunner:0.1.0" as py

    #let compiled = py.compile(
    ```python
    def find_emails(string):
        import re
        return re.findall(r"\b[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}\b", string)

    def sum_all(*array):
        return sum(array)
    ```)

    #let txt = "My email address is john.doe@example.com and my friend's email address is jane.doe@example.net."

    #py.call(compiled, "find_emails", txt)
    #py.call(compiled, "sum_all", 1, 2, 3)


Block mode is also available.



    #let code = ```
    f'{a+b=}'
    ```

    #py.block(code, globals: (a: 1, b: 2))

    #py.block(code, globals: (a: "1", b: "2"))


The result will be ` a+b=3 ` and ` a+b='12' ` .

==  Current limitations

Due to restrictions of typst and its plugin system, some Python function will
not work as expected:

  - File and network IO will always raise an exception.
  - ` datatime.now ` will always return 1970-01-01.

Also, there is no way to import third-party modules. Only bundled stdlib
modules are available. We might find a way to lift this restriction, so feel
free to submit an issue if you want this functionality.

= *diverential.md*

=  diverential

0.2.0

Format differentials conveniently.

` diverential ` is a [ Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) package
simplifying the typesetting of differentials. It is the equivalent to
LaTeXâs ` diffcoeff ` , though not as mature.

==  Overview

` diverential ` allows normal, partial, compact, and separated derivatives
with smart degree calculations.



    #import "@preview/diverential:0.2.0": *

    $ dv(f, x, deg: 2, eval: 0) $
    $ dvp(f, x, y, eval: 0, evalsym: "[") $
    $ dvpc(f, x) $
    $ dvps(f, #([x], 2), #([y], [n]), #([z], [m]), eval: 0) $


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/diverential/0.2.0/examples/overview.jpg)

==  ` dv `

` dv ` is an ordinary derivative. It takes the function as its first argument and the variable as its second one. A degree can be specified with ` deg ` . The derivate can be specified to be evaluated at a point with ` eval ` , the brackets of which can be changed with ` evalsym ` . ` space ` influences the space between derivative and evaluation bracket. Unless defined otherwise, no space is set by default, except for ` | ` , where a small gap is introduced.

===  ` dvs `

Same as ` dv ` , but separates the function from the derivative.
Example: $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} f $$

===  ` dvc `

Same as ` dv ` , but uses a compact derivative.
Example: $$ \mathrm{d}_x f $$

==  ` dvp `

` dv ` is a partial derivative. It takes the function as its first argument
and the variable as the rest. For information on ` eval ` , ` evalsym ` , and
` space ` , read the description of ` dv ` .
The variable can be one of these options:

  - plain variable, e.g. ` x `
  - list of variables, e.g. ` x, y `
  - list of variables with higher degrees (type ` (content, integer) ` ), e.g. ` x, #([y], 2) ` The degree is smartly calculated: If all degrees of the variables are integers, the total degree is their sum. If some are content, the integer ones are summed (arithmetically) up and added to the visual sum of the content degrees. Example: ` #([x], n), #([y], 2), z ` â $\frac{\partial^{n+3}}{\partial x^n,\partial y^2,\partial z}$
Specifying ` deg ` manually is always possible and might be required in more
complicated cases.

===  ` dvps `

Same as ` dvp ` , but separates the function from the derivative.
Example: $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} f $$

===  ` dvpc `

Same as ` dvp ` , but uses a compact derivative.
Note: If supplying multiple variables, ` deg ` is ignored.
Example: $$ \partial_x f $$

0.2.0

Create sub figures easily.

Subpar is a [ Typst ](https://typst.app/) package for creating sub figures.



    #import "@preview/subpar:0.2.0"

    #set page(height: auto)
    #set par(justify: true)

    #subpar.grid(
      figure(image("/assets/andromeda.jpg"), caption: [
        An image of the andromeda galaxy.
      ]), <a>,
      figure(image("/assets/mountains.jpg"), caption: [
        A sunset illuminating the sky above a mountain range.
      ]), <b>,
      columns: (1fr, 1fr),
      caption: [A figure composed of two sub figures.],
      label: <full>,
    )

    Above in @full, we see a figure which is composed of two other figures, namely @a and @b.

= *t4t.md*

=  t4t

0.3.2

A utility package for typst package authors

> A utility package for typst package authors.

*Tools for Typst* ( ` t4t ` in short) is a utility package for [ Typst
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/t4t/0.3.2/typst/typst)
package and template authors. It provides solutions to some recurring tasks in
package development.

The package can be imported or any useful parts of it copied into a project.
It is perfectly fine to treat ` t4t ` as a snippet collection and to pick and
choose only some useful functions. For this reason, most functions are
implemented without further dependencies.

Hopefully, this collection will grow over time with _Typst_ to provide
solutions for common problems.

==  Usage

Either import the package from the Typst preview repository:



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": *


If only a few functions from ` t4t ` are needed, simply copy the necessary
code to the beginning of the document.

==  Reference

- * *

*Note:* This reference might be out of date. Please refer to the manual for
a complete overview of all functions.

- * *

The functions are categorized into different submodules that can be imported
separately.

The modules are:

  - ` is `
  - ` def `
  - ` assert `
  - ` alias `
  - ` math `
  - ` get `

Any or all modules can be imported the usual way:



    // Import as "t4t"
    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2"
    // Import all modules
    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": *
    // Import specific modules
    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": is, def


In general, the main value is passed last to the utility functions. ` #def.if-
none() ` , for example, takes the default value first and the value to test
second. This is somewhat counterintuitive at first, but allows the use of `
.with() ` to generate derivative functions:



    #let is-foo = eq.with("foo")


===  Test functions



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": is


These functions provide shortcuts to common tests like ` #is.eq() ` . Some of
these are not shorter as writing pure Typst code (e.g. ` a == b ` ), but can
easily be used in ` .any() ` or ` .find() ` calls:



    // check all values for none
    if some-array.any(is-none) {
    	...
    }

    // find first not none value
    let x = (none, none, 5, none).find(is.not-none)

    // find position of a value
    let pos-bar = args.pos().position(is.eq.with("|"))


There are two exceptions: ` is-none ` and ` is-auto ` . Since keywords canât
be used as function names, the ` is ` module canât define a function to do `
is.none() ` . Therefore the methods ` is-none ` and ` is-auto ` are provided
in the base module of ` t4t ` :



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": is-none, is-auto


The ` is ` submodule still has these tests, but under different names ( ` is.n
` and ` is.non ` for ` none ` and ` is.a ` and ` is.aut ` for ` auto ` ).

  - ` #is.neq( test ) ` : Creates a new test function that is ` true ` when ` test ` is ` false ` . Can be used to create negations of tests like ` #let not-raw = is.neg(is.raw) ` .

  - ` #is.eq( a, b ) ` : Tests if values ` a ` and ` b ` are equal.

  - ` #is.neq( a, b ) ` : Tests if values ` a ` and ` b ` are not equal.

  - ` #is.n( ..values ) ` : Tests if any of the passed ` values ` is ` none ` .

  - ` #is.non( ..values ) ` : Alias for ` is.n ` .

  - ` #is.not-none( ..values ) ` : Tests if all of the passed ` values ` are not ` none ` .

  - ` #is.not-n( ..values ) ` : Alias for ` is.not-none ` .

  - ` #is.a( ..values ) ` : Tests if any of the passed ` values ` is ` auto ` .

  - ` #is.aut( ..values ) ` : Alias for ` is-a ` .

  - ` #is.not-auto( ..values ) ` : Tests if all of the passed ` values ` are not ` auto ` .

  - ` #is.not-a( ..values ) ` : Alias for ` is.not-auto ` .

  - ` #is.empty( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is _empty_ . A value is considered _empty_ if it is an empty array, dictionary or string or ` none ` otherwise.

  - ` #is.not-empty( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is not empty.

  - ` #is.any( ..compare, value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is equal to any one of the other passed-in values.

  - ` #is.not-any( ..compare, value) ` : Tests if ` value ` is not equal to any one of the other passed-in values.

  - ` #is.has( ..keys, value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` contains all the passed ` keys ` . Either as keys in a dictionary or elements in an array. If ` value ` is neither of those types, ` false ` is returned.

  - ` #is.type( t, value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is of type ` t ` .

  - ` #is.dict( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a dictionary.

  - ` #is.arr( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is an array.

  - ` #is.content( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is of type content.

  - ` #is.color( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a color.

  - ` #is.stroke( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a stroke.

  - ` #is.loc( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a location.

  - ` #is.bool( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a boolean.

  - ` #is.str( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a string.

  - ` #is.int( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is an integer.

  - ` #is.float( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a float.

  - ` #is.num( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a numeric value ( ` integer ` or ` float ` ).

  - ` #is.frac( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a fraction.

  - ` #is.length( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a length.

  - ` #is.rlength( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a relative length.

  - ` #is.ratio( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a ratio.

  - ` #is.align( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is an alignment.

  - ` #is.align2d( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a 2d alignment.

  - ` #is.func( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a function.

  - ` #is.any-type( ..types, value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` has any of the passed-in types.

  - ` #is.same-type( ..values ) ` : Tests if all passed-in values have the same type.

  - ` #is.all-of-type( t, ..values ) ` : Tests if all of the passed-in values have the type ` t ` .

  - ` #is.none-of-type( t, ..values ) ` : Tests if none of the passed-in values has the type ` t ` .

  - ` #is.one-not-none( ..values ) ` : Checks, if at least one value in ` values ` is not equal to ` none ` . Useful for checking multiple optional arguments for a valid value: ` #if is.one-not-none(..args.pos()) [ #args.pos().find(is.not-none) ] `

  - ` #is.elem( func, value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a content element with ` value.func() == func ` . If ` func ` is a string, ` value ` will be compared to ` repr(value.func()) ` instead.

Both of these effectively do the same:


        #is.elem(raw, some_content)
    #is.elem("raw", some_content)


  - ` #is.sequence( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a sequence of content.

  - ` #is.raw( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a raw element.

  - ` #is.table( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a table element.

  - ` #is.list( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a list element.

  - ` #is.enum( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is an enum element.

  - ` #is.terms( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a terms element.

  - ` #is.cols( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a columns element.

  - ` #is.grid( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a grid element.

  - ` #is.stack( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is a stack element.

  - ` #is.label( value ) ` : Tests if ` value ` is of type ` label ` .

===  Default values



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": def


These functions perform a test to decide if a given ` value ` is _invalid_ .
If the test _passes_ , the ` default ` is returned, the ` value ` otherwise.

Almost all functions support an optional ` do ` argument, to be set to a
function of one argument, that will be applied to the value if the test fails.
For example:



    // Sets date to a datetime from an optional
    // string argument in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"
    #let date = def.if-none(
    	datetime.today(), 	// default
    	passed_date, 		// passed-in argument
    	do: (d) >= {		// post-processor
    		d = d.split("-")
    		datetime(year=d[0], month=d[1], day=d[2])
    	}
    )


  - ` #def.if-true( test, default, do:none, value ) ` : Returns ` default ` if ` test ` is ` true ` , ` value ` otherwise.
  - ` #def.if-false( test, default, do:none, value ) ` : Returns ` default ` if ` test ` is ` false ` , ` value ` otherwise.
  - ` #def.if-none( default, do:none, value ) ` : Returns ` default ` if ` value ` is ` none ` , ` value ` otherwise.
  - ` #def.if-auto( default, do:none, value ) ` : Returns ` default ` if ` value ` is ` auto ` , ` value ` otherwise.
  - ` #def.if-any( ..compare, default, do:none, value ) ` : Returns ` default ` if ` value ` is equal to any of the passed-in values, ` value ` otherwise. ( ` #def.if-any(none, auto, 1pt, width) ` )
  - ` #def.if-not-any( ..compare, default, do:none, value ) ` : Returns ` default ` if ` value ` is not equal to any of the passed-in values, ` value ` otherwise. ( ` #def.if-not-any(left, right, top, bottom, position) ` )
  - ` #def.if-empty( default, do:none, value ) ` : Returns ` default ` if ` value ` is _empty_ , ` value ` otherwise.
  - ` #def.as-arr( ..values ) ` : Always returns an array containing all ` values ` . Any arrays in ` values ` will be flattened into the result. This is useful for arguments, that can have one element or an array of elements: ` #def.as-arr(author).join(", ") ` .

===  Assertions



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": assert


This submodule overloads the default ` assert ` function and provides more
asserts to quickly check if given values are valid. All functions use ` assert
` in the background.

Since a module in Typst is not callable, the ` assert ` function is now
available as ` assert.that() ` . ` assert.eq ` and ` assert.ne ` work as
expected.

All assert functions take an optional argument ` message ` to set the error
message shown if the assert fails.

  - ` #assert.that( test ) ` : Asserts that the passed ` test ` is ` true ` .

  - ` #assert.that-not( test ) ` : Asserts that the passed ` test ` is ` false ` .

  - ` #assert.eq( a, b ) ` : Asserts that ` a ` is equal to ` b ` .

  - ` #assert.ne( a, b ) ` : Asserts that ` a ` is not equal to ` b ` .

  - ` #assert.neq( a, b ) ` : Alias for ` assert.ne ` .

  - ` #assert.not-none( value ) ` : Asserts that ` value ` is not equal to ` none ` .

  - ` #assert.any( ..values, value ) ` : Asserts that ` value ` is one of the passed ` values ` .

  - ` #assert.not-any( ..values, value ) ` : Asserts that ` value ` is not one of the passed ` values ` .

  - ` #assert.any-type( ..types, value ) ` : Asserts that the type of ` value ` is one of the passed ` types ` .

  - ` #assert.not-any-type( ..types, value ) ` : Asserts that the type of ` value ` is not one of the passed ` types ` .

  - ` #assert.all-of-type( t, ..values ) ` : Asserts that the type of all passed ` values ` is equal to ` t ` .

  - ` #assert.none-of-type( t, ..values ) ` : Asserts that the type of all passed ` values ` is not equal to ` t ` .

  - ` #assert.not-empty( value ) ` : Asserts that ` value ` is not _empty_ .

  - ` #assert.new( test ) ` : Creates a new assert function that uses the passed ` test ` . ` test ` is a function with signature ` (any) => boolean ` . This is a quick way to create an assertion from any of the ` is ` functions:

        #let assert-foo = assert.new(is.eq.with("foo"))

    #let assert-length = assert.new(is.length)


==  Element helpers



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": get


This submodule is a collection of functions, that mostly deal with content
elements and _get_ some information from them. Though some handle other types
like dictionaries.

  - ` #get.dict( ..values ) ` : Create a new dictionary from the passed ` values ` . All named arguments are stored in the new dictionary as is. All positional arguments are grouped in key-value pairs and inserted into the dictionary:

        #get.dict("a", 1, "b", 2, "c", d:4, e:5)

    // (a:1, b:2, c:none, d:4, e:5)


  - ` #get.dict-merge( ..dicts ) ` : Recursively merges the passed-in dictionaries:

        #get.dict-merge(
    	(a: 1),
    	(a: (one: 1, two:2)),
    	(a: (two: 4, three:3))
    )

    // (a:(one:1, two:4, three:3))


  - ` #get.args( args, prefix: "" ) ` : Creates a function to extract values from an argument sink ` args ` .

The resulting function takes any number of positional and named arguments and
creates a dictionary with values from ` args.named() ` . Positional arguments
are present in the result if they are present in ` args.named() ` . Named
arguments are always present, either with their value from ` args.named() ` or
with the provided value.

A ` prefix ` can be specified, to extract only specific arguments. The
resulting dictionary will have all keys with the prefix removed, though.


        #let my-func( ..options, title ) = block(
    	..get.args(options)(
    		"spacing", "above", "below",
    		width:100%
    	)
    )[
    	#text(..get.args(options, prefix:"text-")(
    		fill:black, size:0.8em
    	), title)
    ]

    #my-func(
    	width: 50%,
    	text-fill: red, text-size: 1.2em
    )[#lorem(5)]


  - ` #get.text( element, sep: "" ) ` : Recursively extracts the text content of a content element. If present, all child elements are converted to text and joined with ` sep ` .

  - ` #get.stroke-paint( stroke, default: black ) ` : Returns the color of ` stroke ` . If no color information is available, ` default ` is used. (Deprecated, use ` stroke.paint ` instead.)

  - ` #get.stroke-thickness( stroke, default: 1pt ) ` : Returns the thickness of ` stroke ` . If no thickness information is available, ` default ` is used. (Deprecated, use ` stroke.thickness ` instead.)

  - ` #get.stroke-dict( stroke, ..overrides ) ` : Creates a dictionary with the keys necessary for a stroke. The returned dictionary is guaranteed to have the keys ` paint ` , ` thickness ` , ` dash ` , ` cap ` and ` join ` .

If ` stroke ` is a dictionary itself, all key-value pairs are copied to the
resulting stroke. Any named arguments in ` overrides ` will override the
previous value.

  - ` #get.inset-at( direction, inset, default: 0pt ) ` : Returns the inset (or outset) in a given ` direction ` , ascertained from ` inset ` .

  - ` #get.inset-dict( inset, ..overrides ) ` : Creates a dictionary usable as an inset (or outset) argument.

The resulting dictionary is guaranteed to have the keys ` top ` , ` left ` , `
bottom ` and ` right ` .

If ` inset ` is a dictionary itself, all key-value pairs are copied to the
resulting stroke. Any named arguments in ` overrides ` will override the
previous value.

  - ` #get.x-align( align, default:left ) ` : Returns the alignment along the x-axis from the passed-in ` align ` value. If none is present, ` default ` is returned. (Deprecated, use ` align.x ` instead.)

        #get.x-align(top + center) // center


  - ` #get.y-align( align, default:top ) ` : Returns the alignment along the y-axis from the passed-in ` align ` value. If none is present, ` default ` is returned. (Deprecated, use ` align.y ` instead.)

==  Math functions



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": math


Some functions to complement the native ` calc ` module.

  - ` #math.minmax( a, b ) ` : Returns an array with the minimum of ` a ` and ` b ` as the first element and the maximum as the second:

        #let (min, max) = math.minmax(a, b)


  - ` #math.clamp( min, max, value ) ` : Clamps a value between ` min ` and ` max ` . In contrast to ` calc.clamp() ` this function works for other values than numbers, as long as they are comparable.

        text-size = math.clamp(0.8em, 1.2em, text-size)


  - ` #lerp( min, max, t ) ` : Calculates the linear interpolation of ` t ` between ` min ` and ` max ` .

        #let width = math.lerp(0%, 100%, x)


` t ` should be a value between 0 and 1, but the interpolation works with
other values, too. To constrain the result into the given interval, use `
math.clamp ` :


        #let width = math.lerp(0%, 100%, math.clamp(0, 1, x))


  - ` #map( min, max, range-min, range-max, value ) ` : Maps a ` value ` from the interval ` [min, max] ` into the interval ` [range-min, range-max] ` :

        #let text-weight = int(math.map(8pt, 16pt, 400, 800, text-size))


==  Alias functions



    #import "@preview/t4t:0.3.2": alias


Some of the native Typst function as aliases, to prevent collisions with some
common argument names.

For example using ` numbering ` as an argument is not possible if the value is
supposed to be passed to the ` numbering() ` function. To still allow argument
names that are in line with the common Typst names (like ` numbering ` , `
align ` â¦), these alias functions can be used:



    #let excercise( no, numbering: "1)" ) = [
    	Exercise #alias.numbering(numbering, no)
    ]


The following functions have aliases right now:

  - ` numbering `
  - ` align `
  - ` type `
  - ` label `
  - ` text `
  - ` raw `
  - ` table `
  - ` list `
  - ` enum `
  - ` terms `
  - ` grid `
  - ` stack `
  - ` columns `

](https://github.com/maucejo/elsearticle/blob/main/docs/manual.pdf)

` elsearticle ` is a Typst template that aims to mimic the Elsevier article
LaTeX class, a.k.a. ` elsearticle.cls ` , provided by Elsevier to format
manuscript properly for submission to their journals.

==  Basic usage

This section provides the minimal amount of information to get started with
the template. For more detailed information, see the [ manual
](https://github.com/maucejo/elsearticle/blob/main/docs/manual.pdf) .

To use the ` elsearticle ` template, you need to include the following line at
the beginning of your ` typ ` file:



    #import "@preview/elsearticle:0.4.0": *


===  Initializing the template

After importing ` elsearticle ` , you have to initialize the template by a
show rule with the ` #elsearticle() ` command. This function takes an optional
argument to specify the title of the document.

  - ` title ` : Title of the paper
  - ` author ` : List of the authors of the paper
  - ` abstract ` : Abstract of the paper
  - ` journal ` : Name of the journal
  - ` keywords ` : List of keywords of the paper
  - ` format ` : Format of the paper. Possible values are ` preprint ` , ` review ` , ` 1p ` , ` 3p ` , ` 5p `
  - ` numcol ` : Number of columns of the paper. Possible values are 1 and 2
  - ` line-numbering ` : Enable line numbering. Possible values are ` true ` and ` false `

==  Additional features

The ` elsearticle ` template provides additional features to help you format
your document properly.

===  Appendix

To activate the appendix environment, all you have to do is to place the
following command in your document:



    #show: appendix

    // Appendix content here


===  Subfigures

Subfigures are not built-in features of Typst, but the ` elsearticle `
template provides a way to handle them. It is based on the ` subpar ` package
that allows you to create subfigures and properly reference them.



      #subfigure(
        figure(image("image1.png"), caption: []), <figa>,
        figure(image("image2.png"), caption: []), <figb>,
        columns: (1fr, 1fr),
        caption: [(a) Left image and (b) Right image],
        label: <fig>
      )


===  Equations

The ` elsearticle ` template provides the ` #nonumeq() ` function to create
unnmbered equations. The latter function can be used as follows:



    #nonumeq[$
      y = f(x)
      $
    ]


==  Roadmap

_Article format_

  - [x] Preprint
  - [x] Review
  - [x] 1p
  - [x] 3p
  - [x] 5p

_Environment_

  - [x] Implementation of the ` appendix ` environment

![A preview of the modern-acad-cv Typst
template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/modern-acad-
cv-0.1.1-small.webp)

=  modern-acad-cv

0.1.1

A CV template for academics based on moderncv LaTeX package.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=modern-acad-cv&version=0.1.1)

This template for an academic CV serves the peculiarities of academic CVs. If
you are not an academic, this template is not useful. Most of the times in
academics, applicants need to show everything they have done. This makes it a
bit cumbersome doing it by single entries. In addition, academics might apply
to institutions around the globe, making it necessary to send translated CVs
or at least translations of some parts (i.e., title of papers in different
languages).

This template serves these special needs in introducting automated sections
based on indicated ` yaml ` -files. Furthermore, it has a simplified
multilingual support by setting different headers, title etc. for different
languages (by the user in the ` yaml ` -fields). With this template, it might
be more handy to keep your CV easier on track, especially when you need in
different languages, since managing a ` yaml ` -file is easier than checking
typesetting files against each other.

This template is influenced by LaTeXâs [ moderncv
](https://github.com/moderncv/moderncv) and its typst translation [ moderner-
cv ](https://github.com/DeveloperPaul123/modern-cv) .

==  Fonts

In this template, the use of FontAwesome icons via the [ fontawesome typst
package ](https://typst.app/universe/package/fontawesome) is possible, as well
as the icons from Academicons [ use-academicons typst package
](https://typst.app/universe/package/use-academicons) . To use these icons
properly, you need to install each fonts on your system. You can download [
fontawesome here ](https://fontawesome.com/download) and [ academicons here
](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) . Both typst packages will be load
by the template itself.

Furthermore, I included my favorite font [ Fira Sans
](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) . You can download it here [
here ](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) , or just change the font
argument in ` modern-acad-cv() ` .

==  Usage

The main function to load the construct of the academic CV is ` modern-acad-
cv() ` . After importing the template, you can call it right away. If you
donât have [ Fira Sans ](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans)
installed, choose a different font. Examples are given below.



    #import "@preview/modern-acad-cv:0.1.1": *

    #show: modern-acad-cv.with(
      metadata,
      multilingual,
      lang: "en",
      font: ("Fira Sans", "Andale Mono", "Roboto"),
      show-date: true,
      body
    )

    // ...


In the remainder, I show basic settings and how to use the automated functions
with the corresponding ` yaml ` -file.

===  Setting up the main file and the access to the ` yaml ` -files

A first step in your document is to invoke the template. Second, since this
template works with ` yaml ` -files in the background you need to specify
paths to each ` yaml ` -file you want to use throughout the document.

The template comes along with the ` metadata.yaml ` . In the beginning of this
yaml-file you set colors. Feel free to change it to your preferred color
scheme.



    colors:
      main_color: "#579D90"
      lightgray_color: "#d5d5d5"
      gray_color: "#737373"
      ...


At the beginning of your document, you just set then set the metadata-object:



    #import "@preview/modern-acad-cv:0.1.0": *

    #let metadata = yaml("metadata.yaml")


Initially, the ` metadata.yaml ` is located on the same level as the `
example.typ ` . All other ` yaml ` -files are saved in the folder ` dbs ` .
Since ` typ ` -documents search for paths from the root of the document in
that the function is called, you have to give the databases for the entry
along the ` metadata.yaml ` within each function call.

===  socials

Contact details are important. In this CV template, you have the possibility
to use fontawesome icons and academicons. To use socials, you just need to
specify in ` metadata.yaml ` , the wanted entries.

As you can see below, you set a category, i.e. email or lattes and then you
have to define four arguments: ` username ` , ` prefix ` , ` icon ` , and `
set ` . The ` username ` will be used for constructing the link and will be
shown next to the logo. The ` prefix ` is needed to build the valid link. The
` icon ` is the name of the icon in the respective set, which is chosen in `
set ` .



    personal:
      name: ["Mustermensch, Momo"]
      socials:
        email:
          username: momo@mustermensch.com
          prefix: "mailto:"
          icon: paper-plane
          set: fa
        homepage:
          username: momo.github.io
          prefix: https://
          icon: globe
          set: fa
        orcid:
          username: 0000-0000-0000-0000
          prefix: https://orcid.org
          icon: orcid
          set: ai
        lattes:
          username: "1234567891234567"
          prefix: http://lattes.cnpq.br/
          icon: lattes
          set: ai
        ...


===  Language setting & headers

In order to support changing headers, you need to specify the language and the
different content for each header in each language in the ` i18n.yaml ` in the
folder ` dbs ` .

The structure of the yaml is simple:



    lang:
      de:
        subtitle: Short CV
        education: Hochschulbildung
        work: Akademische Berufserfahrung (Auswahl)
        grants: FÃ¶rdermittel, Stipendien & Preise
        ...
      en:
        subtitle: Short CV
        education: Higher education
        work: Academic work experience (selection)
        grants: Scholarships & awards
        ...
      pt:
        subtitle: CurrÃ­culo
        education: FormaÃ§Ã£o acadÃªmica
        work: AtuaÃ§Ã£o profissional (seleÃ§Ã£o)
        grants: Bolsas de estudo e prÃ©mios
        ...


For each language, you want to use later, you have to define all the entries.
Reminder, donât change the entry names, since the functions wonât find it
under different names without changing the functions.

First you have to set up a variable that inherits the ISO-language code, save
the database into an object (here ` multilingual ` ) and then give the object
` multilingual ` and ` language ` to the function ` create-headers ` :



    // set the language of the document
    #let language = "pt"

    // loading multilingual database
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/i18n.yaml")

    // defining variables
    #let headerLabs = create-headers(multilingual, lang: language)


You create an object ` headerLabs ` that uses the function ` create-headers()
` which will define the headers as you provided in the ` yaml ` . Then by
switching the language object, all headers (if used accordingly to the naming
in the ` yaml ` ) will change directly.

Throughout the document you then reference the created ` headerLabs ` object.
If you change language, and values are provided, these automatically change.



    = #headerLabs.at("work")

    ...

    = #headerLabs.at("education")

    ...

    = #headerLabs.at("grants")


===  Automated functions

All of the following functions share common arguments: ` what ` , `
multilingual ` , and ` lang ` . In ` what ` , you always declare the database
you want to use with the function.

For example, to get work entries, you choose ` work ` , which you defined
beforehand as input from ` work.yaml ` . In the ` multilingual ` argument, you
just pass the ` multilingual ` object. In ` lang ` you pass your ` language `
object.



    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let work = yaml("dbs/work.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"

    // Function call with objects
    #cv-auto-stc(work, multilingual, lang: language)



===  Sorting publications and referencing your own name or correpsonding

Since ` typst ` so far does not support multiple bibliographies or subsetting
these, this function let you choose specific entries via the ` entries `
argument or group of entries by the ` tag ` argument. Furthermore, you can
indicate a string in ` me ` that can be highlighted in every output entry
(i.e., your formatted name). So far, this function leads to another function
that create APA-style format, if you want to use any other citation style, you
need to download the template on [ github ](https://github.com/bpkleer/modern-
acad-cv) , introduce your own styling and then add it in the ` cv-refs() `
function.



    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let refs = yaml("dbs/refs/yaml")

    // function call of group of peer-reviewed with tag `peer`
    #cv-refs(refs, multilingual, tag: "peer", me: [Mustermensch, M.], lang: language)


You see in the example pictures that I used this function to built five
different subheaders, i.e. for peer reviewed articles ( ` tag: "peer" ` ) and
chapters in edited books ( ` tag: "edited" ` ). You can define the tags how
you want, however, they need to put them into ` tag: <str> ` .

Sometimes, it is not only necessary to highlight your own name, you might also
want to indicate yourself as corresponding author. This can be done through
the ` refs.yaml ` which adhere to [ Hayagriva
](https://github.com/typst/hayagriva) . By adding an argument ` corresponding
` in the yaml and setting the value to ` true ` , a small ` C ` will appear
next to your name.



    Mustermensch2023:
      type: "article"
      date: 2023
      page-range: 55-78
      title: "Populism and Social Media: A Comparative Study of Political Mobilization"
      tags: "peer"

      serial-number:
        doi: "10.1016/j.jpolcom.2023.102865"


For applications abroad, it might be worth to translate at least title of the
publications so that other persons easily can see what the paper is about. In
every ` title ` argument, you can therefore provide a dictionary with the
language codes and the titles. Keep the original title in ` main ` and the
translations with the corresponding language shortcut (i.e., ` "en" ` or `
"pt" ` ). The function prints the main and translated title, depending on the
provided translation in the ` refs.yaml ` . Be aware, here you find not ` de `
in the dictionary, instead you find ` main ` . The original title needs to be
wrapped in ` main ` .



    Mustermensch2023:

      serial-number:
        doi: "10.1016/j.jpolcom.2023.102865"


===  cv-auto-skills()

Instead of just enumerating your skills or your knowledge of specific
software, you can build a skill-matrix with this function. In this skill-
matrix, you can have sections, i.e. _Computer Languages_ , _Programs_ and
_Languages_ . These sections are the highest level in the corresponding `
skills.yaml ` :



    computer:
      ...
    programs:
      ...
    languages:
      ...



You can then define in each categories specific skills, i.e. German and
Portuguese in ` languages ` :



    computer:
      ...
    programs:
      ...
    languages:
      german:
        ...
      portugues:
       ...



For each entry, you have to define ` name ` , ` level ` and ` description ` .



    languages:
      ...
      pt:
        name:
          de: Portugiesisch
          en: Portuguese
          pt: PortuguÃªs
        level: 3
        description:
          de: fortgeschritten
          en: advanced
          pt: avanÃ§ado


As you can see, you can again define language-dependent names in ` name ` and
descriptions in ` description ` . ` level ` is a numeric value and indicates
how many of the four boxes are filled to indicate you level of proficiency. If
you donât have the need for a CV of different languages, you can directly
define ` name ` or ` description ` .

You have to call the function with three objects ` skills ` , ` multilingual `
, and ` metadata ` and the corresponding ` language ` of the document:



    #let skills = yaml("dbs/skills.yaml")
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let metadata = yaml("dbs/metadata.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"

    #cv-auto-skills(skills, multilingual, metadata, lang: language)


===  Print your info without any formatting

The function ` cv-auto ` is the base function for printing the provided infos
in the specified ` yaml ` file with no further formatting. The functions ` cv-
auto-stc ` and ` cv-auto-stp ` do only differ in the point that ` cv-auto-stc
` both give the title in bold, ` cv-auto-stp ` puts the subtitle in
parentheses and ` cv-auto-stc ` puts the subtitle after a comma.

The structure of the corresponding ` yaml ` files is simple: in each entry you
can have the following entries: ` title ` , ` subtitle ` , ` location ` , `
description ` and ` left ` . ` title ` is mandatory, ` subtitle ` , ` location
` , and ` description ` are voluntary. In all functions you need to specify `
left ` , which indicates period of time, or year. For ` title ` , ` subtitle `
, ` location ` , and ` description ` , you can provide a dictionary for
different languages (see below).



    master:
      title:
        de: Master of Arts
        en: Master of Arts
        pt: PÃ³s-GraduaÃ§Ã£o
      subtitle:
        de: Sozialwissenschaften
        en: Social Sciences
        pt: CiÃªncias Sociais
      location:
        de: Exzellenz-UniversitÃ¤t
        en: University of Excellence
        pt: Universidade de ExcelÃªncia
      description:
        de: mit Auszeichnung
        en: with distinction
        pt: com distinÃ§Ã£o
      left: "2014"


In your main document, you then easily call the function and transfer the
standard arguments ` what ` , ` metadata ` , and ` lang ` .



    // section of education
    #let education = yaml("dbs/education.yaml")
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"

    #cv-auto-stp(education, multilingual, lang: language)

    // section of work positions
    #let work = yaml("dbs/work.yaml")
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"

    #cv-auto-stc(work, multilingual, lang: language)

    // section of given talks
    #let talks = yaml("dbs/talks.yaml")
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"

    #cv-auto(talks, multilingual, lang: language)


===  Creating a list instead of single entrie

Sometimes, instead of giving every entry, you want to group by year. Another
example for this case could be that you want to summarize your memberships or
reviewer duties.

The function ` cv-auto-list ` uses just the standard input:



    #let conferences = yaml("dbs/conferences.yaml")
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"

    #cv-auto-list(conferences, multilingual, lang: language)


The corresponding ` yaml ` file is differently organized: The entry point in
the file is the corresponding year. In every year, you organize your entries
(i.e. conference participations). In each entry in a year, you have the ` name
` and ` action ` entry. You can provide a dictionary for the ` name ` . For `
action ` , I used ` P ` and ` C ` , for _paper/presentation_ and _chair_ . You
can then manually define this upfront the function call for the reader, or you
use the ` i18n.yaml ` , indicate the explanations for each language in ` exp-
confs ` and then it automatically changes with the specific language code.



    "2024":
      conference2:
        name: European Conference on Gender and Politics
        action: P
      conference1:
        name: ECPR General Conference
        action: P, C


The action will be added after each conference name in superscripts.

===  Creating a table

This case is mostly used for listing your prior teaching experience. The
corresponding ` teaching.yaml ` for this description, is organized as
followed:



    "2024":
      course1:
        summer: T
        name:
          de: "Statistik+: Einstieg in R leicht gemacht"
          en: "Statistics+: Starting with R (de)"
          pt: "EstatÃ­stica+: ComeÃ§ando com R (de)"
        study:
          de: Bachelor
          en: Bachelor
          pt: GraduaÃ§Ã£o
      ...


First you indicate the year ` "2024" ` and then you organize all courses you
gave within that year (i.e. here ` course1 ` ). Mandatory are ` name ` and `
study ` . For both you can indicate a single value or a dictionary
corresponding to your chosen languages. You can provide ` summer ` if you want
to indicate differences for terms. This is ` boolean ` , the specific word is
then given in the ` i18n.yaml ` under ` table-winter ` resp. ` table-summer `
.

The function then uses again just the standard arguments and plots a table
with the indicated year, name, and study area.



    #let teaching = yaml("dbs/teaching.yaml")
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"

    #cv-table-teaching(teaching, multilingual, lang: language)


===  cv-auto-cats()

In case you want to directly print entries from categories that belong to one
` yaml ` -file, you can use ` cv-auto-cats ` . This will print the header for
each subcategory and then the belonging entries.

An example is given in ` training.yaml ` . In this file, further training is
given by categories (i.e., methods and didactics). Within the categories you
have here courses and then ` title ` , ` location ` , and ` left ` . `
location ` and ` title ` can be dictionaries if you want to translate between
different languages.



    methods:
      course2:
        title: Bayesian modelling in the Social Sciences
        location: An expensive Spring Seminar
        left: "2024"
      ...
    didactics:
      course2:
        title:
          de: Konfliktkompetenz I + II
          en: Conflict competence I + II
          pt: CompetÃªncia de conflitos I + II
        location:
          de: UniversitÃ¤tsallianz
          en: University Alliance
          pt: AlianÃ§a UniversitÃ¡ria
        left: "2019"


Call the function as usal:



    #let training = yaml("dbs/training.yaml")
    #let multilingual = yaml("dbs/multilingual.yaml")
    #let language = "pt"
    #let headerLabs = create-headers(multilingual, lang: language)

    #cv-auto-cats(training, multilingual, headerLabs, lang: language)


===  Special cases: long names

If you have a long name that crosses the social media side, just set the
argument ` split ` to ` true ` within ` metadata.yaml ` :



    ...
      personal:
        name: ["Mustermensch, Momo"]
        split: true
      ...

This package provides functions that replace actual text with random
characters, which is useful for redacting confidential information or sharing
the design and structure of an existing document without disclosing the
content itself. A variety of ready-made sets of characters for replacement are
available (75 in total; termed _alphabets_ ), representing diverse writing
systems, codes, notations and symbols. Some of these are more conservative
(such as emulating redaction using a wide black pen) and many are more
whimsical, as demonstrated by the following example:



    #baffle(alphabet: "welsh")[Hello]. My #tippex[name] is #baffle(alphabet: "underscore")[Inigo Montoya]. You #baffle(alphabet: "alchemy")[killed] my #baffle(alphabet: "shavian")[father]. Prepare to #redact[die].

    Using show rules strings, regular expressions and other selectors can be redacted automatically:

    #show "jan Maja": baffle.with(alphabet: "sitelen-pona")
    #show regex("[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&â_+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)_"): baffle.with(alphabet: "maze-3")

    Iâm jan Maja, and my email is `foo@digitalwords.net`.

Using  Babel  is quite straightforward. A [ *comprehensive manual*

covers:

  - Introductory background.
  - How to use the provided functions ( ` baffle() ` , ` redact() ` and ` tippex() ` ).
  - A list of the provided alphabets, each demonstrated by a line of random text.

If the version of the precompiled manual doesnât match the version of the
package, it means no difference between the two versions is reflected in the
manual.

If you wish to share the Typst source files of your document, not just the
precompiled output, a tool called [ _Typst Mutilate_
](https://github.com/frozolotl/typst-mutilate) might be useful for you. Unlike
Babel  , it is not a Typst package but an external tool, written in Rust. It
replaces the content of a Typst document with random words selected from a
wordlist or random characters (similarly to  Babel  ), changing the document
in place (so make sure to run it on a _copy_ !). As a package for Typst,
Babel  cannot change your source files.

= *outline-summaryst.md*

=  outline-summaryst

0.1.0

A basic template for including a summary for each entry in the table of
contents. Useful for writing books.

==  Description

` outline-summaryst ` is a basic package designed for including a summary for
each entry in the table of contents, particularly useful for writing books. It
provides a simple structure for organizing content and generating formatted
documents with summary sections.

==  Features

  - A template for the outline, which styles both the heading and their summaries.
  - A macro for creating new headings and a summary for each heading.

==  Note:

Because of the way the project is implemented, only the headings created with
the provided ` make-heading("heading name", "summary") ` are shown in in the
outline. Headings created with the default ` = Heading ` syntax will not show
in said outline (though they will show up in the document itself).

==  Example Usage:



    #import "@preview/outline-summaryst:0.1.0": style-outline, make-heading


    // you can set `outline-title: none` in order not to display any title
    #show outline: style-outline.with(outline-title: "Table of Contents")

    #outline()


    #make-heading("Part One", "This is the summary for part one")
    #lorem(500)

    #make-heading("Chapter One", "Summary for chapter one in part one", level: 2)
    #lorem(300)

    #make-heading("Chapter Two", "This is the summary for chapter two in part one", level: 2)
    #lorem(300)

    #make-heading("Part Two", "And here we have the summary for part two")
    #lorem(500)

    #make-heading("Chapter One", "Summary for chapter one in part two", level: 2)
    #lorem(300)

    #make-heading("Chapter Two", "Summary for chapter two in part two", level: 2)
    #lorem(300)


==  Known limitations

  - Currently, we do not provide a way for styling the table of contents or headings

= *blinky.md*

=  blinky

0.1.0

Typesets paper titles in bibliographies as hyperlinks.

This package permits the creation of Typst bibliographies in which paper
titles are typeset as hyperlinks. Hereâs an example (with links typeset in
blue):

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexanderkoller/typst-
blinky/main/examples/screenshot.png)

The bibliography is generated from a Bibtex file, and citations are done with
the usual Typst mechanisms. The hyperlinks are specified through DOI or URL
fields in the Bibtex entries; if such a field is present, the title of the
entry will be automatically typeset as a hyperlink.

See [ here ](https://github.com/alexanderkoller/typst-
blinky/tree/main/examples) for a full example.

==  Usage

Adding hyperlinks to your bibliography is a two-step process: (a) use a CSL
style with magic symbols (explained below), and (b) enclose the ` bibliography
` command with the ` link-bib-urls ` function:



    #import "@preview/blinky:0.1.0": link-bib-urls

    ... @cite something ... @cite more ...

    #let bibsrc = read("custom.bib")
    #link-bib-urls(bibsrc)[
      #bibliography("custom.bib", style: "./association-for-computational-linguistics-blinky.csl")
    ]


Observe that the Bibtex file ` custom.bib ` is loaded twice: once to load into
` link-bib-urls ` and once in the standard Typst ` bibliography ` command.
Obviously, this needs to be the same file twice. See under âAlternative
solutionsâ below why this canât be simplified further at the moment.

If a Bibtex entry contains a DOI field, the title will become a hyperlink to
the DOI. Otherwise, if the Bibtex entry contains a URL field, the title will
become a hyperlink to this URL. Otherwise, the title will be shown as normal,
without a link.

==  CSL with magic symbols

Blinky generates the hyperlinked titles through a regex show rule that
replaces a âmagic symbolâ with a [ link
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/link/) command. This âmagic
symbolâ is a string of the form ` !!BIBENTRY!<key>!! ` , where ` <key> ` is
the Bibtex citation key of the reference.

You will therefore need to tweak your CSL style to use it with Blinky.
Specifically, in every place where you would usually have the paper title,
i.e.





or similar, your CSL file now instead needs to print a decorated version of
the paperâs citation-key (= Bibtex key):





You can have more prefix before and suffix after the ` !!BIBENTRY! ` and ` !!
` , as in the example, but these magic symbols need to be there so Blinky can
find the places in the document where the hyperlinked title needs to be
inserted.

You can check the [ example CSL file
](https://github.com/alexanderkoller/typst-
blinky/blob/main/examples/association-for-computational-linguistics-
blinky.csl) to see what this looks like in practice; compare to [ the
unmodified original ](https://github.com/citation-style-
language/styles/blob/master/association-for-computational-linguistics.csl) .

==  Alternative solutions

The current mechanism in Blinky is somewhat heavy-handed: a Typst plugin uses
the [ biblatex ](https://github.com/typst/biblatex) crate to parse the Bibtex
file (independently of the normal operations of the ` bibliography ` command),
and then all occurrences of the magic symbol in the Typst bibliography are
replaced by the hyperlinked titles.

It would be great to replace this mechanism by something simpler, but it is
actually remarkably tricky to make bibliography titles hyperlinks with the
current version of Typst (0.11.1). All the alternatives that I could think of
donât work. Here are some of them:

  - Print the URL/DOI using the CSL style, and then use a regex show rule to convert it into a ` link ` around the title somehow. This does not work because most URLs contain a colon character (:), and these [ cause trouble with Typst regexes ](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/86) .
  - Make the CSL style output text of the form ` #link(url)[title] ` . This does not work because the content generated by CSL is not evaluated further by Typst. Also, Typst [ does not support show rules for the individual bibliography items ](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/942) , which makes it tricky to call [ eval ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/eval/) on them.
  - Create a show rule for ` link ` . Some CSL styles already generate ` link ` elements if a URL/DOI is present in the bib entry - one could consider replacing it with a ` link ` whose URL is the same as before, but the text is a link symbol or some such. However, a show rule for a link that generates another link runs into an infinite recursion; Typst made [ the deliberate decision ](https://github.com/typst/typst/pull/3327) to handle such recursions only for ` text ` show rules.
  - The best solution would be to simply use an unmodified CSL file, but it is not clear to me how one would pick out the paper title from the bibliography in a general way. Iâm afraid that any solution that hyperlinks titles will require modifications to the CSL style.

It would furthermore be desirable to hide the fact that we are reading the
same Bibtex file twice behind a single function call. However, code in a Typst
package [ resolves all filenames relative to the package directory
](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2126) , which means that the package
cannot access a bibliography file outside of the package directory. We may be
able to simplify this once [ #971 ](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/971)
gets addressed.

= *iconic-salmon-svg.md*

=  iconic-salmon-svg

1.1.0

A Typst library for Social Media references with scalable vector graphics
icons.

The ` iconic-salmon-svg ` package is designed to help you create your
curriculum vitae (CV). It allows you to easily reference your social media
profiles with the typical icon of the service plus a link to your profile.
The package name is a combination of the acronym _SociAL Media icONs_ and the
word _iconic_ because all these icons have an iconic design (and iconic also
contains the word _icon_ ).

==  Features

  - Support for popular social media, developer and career platforms
  - Uniform design for all entries
  - Based on publicly available SVG symbols
  - Easy to use
  - Allows the customization of the look (extra args are passed to [ ` text ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/) )

==  Usage

= *linguify.md*

=  linguify

0.4.1

Load strings for different languages easily

Load strings for different languages easily. This can be useful if you create
a package or template for multilingual usage.

==  Usage

The usage depends if you are using it inside a package or a template or in
your own document.

===  For end users and own templates

You can use linguify global database.

Example:



    #import "@preview/linguify:0.4.0": *

    #let lang_data = toml("lang.toml")
    #set-database(lang_data);

    #set text(lang: "de")

    #linguify("abstract")  // Shows "Zusammenfassung" in the document.


The ` lang.toml ` musst look like this:



    [conf]
    default-lang = "en"

    [en]
    title = "A simple linguify example"
    abstract = "Abstract"

    [de]
    title = "Ein einfaches Linguify Beispiel"
    abstract = "Zusammenfassung"


===  Inside a package

So that multiple packages can use linguify simultaneously, they should contain
their own database. A linguify database is just a dictionary with a certain
structure. (See database structure.)

Recommend is to store the database in a separate file like ` lang.toml ` and
load it inside the document. And specify it in each ` linguify() ` function
call.

Example:



    #import "@preview/linguify:0.4.0": *

    #let database = toml("lang.toml")

    #linguify("key", from: database, default: "key")


==  Features

  - Use a ` toml ` or other file to load strings for different languages. You need to pass a typst dictionary which follows the structure of the shown toml file.
  - Specify a *default-lang* . If none is specified it will default to ` en `
  - *Fallback* to the default-lang if a key is not found for a certain language.
  - [ Fluent ](https://projectfluent.org/) support

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` linguify `



    #import "@preview/linguify:0.4.1"

= *tbl.md*

=  tbl

0.0.4

Complex tables, written concisely

This is a library for [ Typst ](https://typst.app/) built upon Pg Bielâs
fabulous [ ` tablex ` ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex) library.

It allows the creation of complex tables in Typst using a compact syntax based
on the ` tbl ` preprocessor for the traditional UNIX TROFF typesetting system.
There are also some novel features that are not currently offered by Typst
itself or ` tablex ` , namely:

  - Decimal point alignment (using the ` decimalpoint ` region option and ` N ` -classified columns)
  - Columns of equal width (using the ` e ` column modifier)
  - Columns with a guaranteed minimum width (using the ` w ` column modifier)
  - Cells that are ignored when calculating column widths (using the ` z ` column modifier)
  - Equation tables (using the ` mode: "math" ` region option)

Many other features exist to condense common configurations to a concise
syntax.

For example:



    #import "@preview/tbl:0.0.4"
    #show: tbl.template.with(box: true, tab: "|")

    ```tbl
          R | L
          R   N.
    software|version
    _
         AFL|2.39b
        Mutt|1.8.0
        Ruby|1.8.7.374
    TeX Live|2015
    ```


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxcrees/tbl.typ/v0.0.4/test/00/02_software.png)

Many other examples and copious documentation are provided in the [ `
README.pdf ` ](https://maxre.es/tbl.typ/v0.0.4.pdf) file.

[ The source repository ](https://github.com/maxcrees/tbl.typ) also includes a
test suite based on those examples, which can be ran using the GNU ` make `
command. See ` make help ` for details.

![links](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robotechnic/alchemist/master/images/links1.png)

Alchemist uses cetz to draw the molecules. This means that you can draw cetz
shapes in the same canvas as the molecules. Like this:



    #skeletize({
      import cetz.draw: *
      double(absolute: 30deg, name: "l1")
      single(absolute: -30deg, name: "l2")
      molecule("X", name: "X")
      hobby(
        "l1.50%",
        ("l1.start", 0.5, 90deg, "l1.end"),
        "l1.start",
        stroke: (paint: red, dash: "dashed"),
        mark: (end: ">"),
      )
      hobby(
        (to: "X.north", rel: (0, 1pt)),
        ("l2.end", 0.4, -90deg, "l2.start"),
        "l2.50%",
        mark: (end: ">"),
      )
    })

0.1.2

Eval & show typst code outputs inline with their source

![](https://www.github.com/ntjess/showman/raw/v0.1.0/showman.jpg)

- * *

Automagic tools to smooth the package documentation & development process.

  - Package your files for local typst installation or PR submission in one command

  - Provide your readme in typst format with code block examples, and let ` showman ` do the rest! In one command, it will the readme to markdown and render code block outputs as included images.

    - Bonus points â let ` showman ` know your repository path and it will ensure images will properly appear in your readme even after your package has been distributed through typstâs registry.
  - Execute non-typst code blocks and render their outputs

*Prerequisites* : Make sure you have ` typst ` and ` pandoc ` available from
the command line. Then, in a python virtual environment, run:



    pip install showman


Create a typst file with ` ```example ` code blocks that show the output you
want to include in your readme. For instance:



    #import "@preview/cetz:0.1.2"
    // Just to avoid showing this heading in the readme itself
    #set heading(outlined: false)

    = Hello, world!
    Let's do something complicated:

    #cetz.canvas({
      import cetz.plot
      import cetz.palette
      cetz.draw.set-style(axes: (tick: (length: -.05)))
      // Plot something
      plot.plot(size: (3,3), x-tick-step: 1, axis-style: "left", {
          for i in range(0, 3) {
          plot.add(domain: (-4, 2),
          x => calc.exp(-(calc.pow(x + i, 2))),
          fill: true, style: palette.tango)
        }
      })
    })


![Example
1](https://www.github.com/ntjess/showman/raw/v0.1.0/assets/example-1.png)

Then, run the following command:



    showman md


Congrats, you now have a readme with inline images ð

You can optionally specify your workspace root, output file name, image
folder, etc. These options are visible under ` showman md --help ` .

*Note* : You can customize the appearance of these images by providing `
showman ` the template to use when creating them. In your file to be rendered,
create a variable called ` showman-config ` at the outermost scope:



    // Render images with a black background and red text
    #let showman-config = (
      template: it => {
        set text(fill: red)
        rect(fill: black, it)
      }
    )


Behind the scenes, showman imports your file as a module and looks for this
variable. If it is found, your template and a few other options are injected
into the example rendering process.

*Note* : If every example has the same setup (package imports, etc.), and
you donât want the text to be included in your examples, you can pass `
eval-kwargs ` in this config as well to specify a string that gets prefixed to
every example. Alternatively, pass variables in a scope directly:



    // Setup either through providing scope or import prefixes
    #let my-variable = 5
    #let showman-config = (
      eval-kwargs: (
        prefix: "#import \"@preview/cetz:0.1.2\"
      ),
      // Now you can use `my-var` in your examples
      scope: (my-var: my-variable)
    )


==  Caveats

  - ` showman ` uses the beautiful ` pandoc ` to do most of the markdown conversion heavy lifting. So, if your document canât be processed by pandoc, you may need to adjust your syntax until pandoc is happy making a markdown document.

  - Typst doesnât allow page styling inside containers. Since ` showman ` must use containers to extract each rendered example, you canât use ` #set page(...) ` or ` #pagebreak() ` inside your examples.

If you donât care about converting your readme to markdown, itâs even
easier to have example rendered alongside their code. Simply add the following
preamble to your file:



    #import "@preview/showman:0.1.1"
    #show: showman.formatter.template

    The code below will be rendered side by side with its output:

    ``` typst
    = Hello world!
    ```
    ![Example 2](https://www.github.com/ntjess/showman/raw/v0.1.0/assets/example-2.png)

    Several keywords can be privded to customize appearance and more. See `showman.formatter.template` for more details.


Youâve done the hard work of creating a beautiful, well-documented manual.
Now itâs time to share it with the world. ` showman ` can help you package
your files for distribution in one command, after some minimal setup.

  1. Make sure you have a ` typst.toml ` file that follows typst [ packaging guidelines ](https://github.com/typst/packages)

  2. Add a new block to your toml file as follows:



    [tool.packager]
    paths = [...]


Where ` paths ` is a list of files and directories you want to include in your
package.

  3. Run the following command from the root of your repository:



    showman package


  4. Without any other arguments, youâve just installed your package in your systemâs local typst packages folder. Now you can import it with ` typst #import "@local/mypackage:<version>" ` .

     - You can alternatively specify the path to your fork of ` typst/packages ` to prep your files for a PR, or specify a ` --namespace ` other than ` local ` .

*Note* : You can see the full list of command options with ` showman package
--help ` .

This package also executes non-typst code (currently bash on non-windows,
python, and c++). You can use ` showman execute ./path/to/file.typ ` to
execute code blocks in these languages, and the output will be captured in a `
.coderunner.json ` file in the root directory you specified. To enable this
feature, you need to add the following preamble to your file:



    #import "@preview/showman:0.1.1": runner

    #let cache = json("/.coderunner.json").at("path/to/file.typ", default: (:))
    #let show-rule = runner.external-code.with(result-cache: cache)

    // Now, apply the show rule to languages that have a `showman execute` result:
    #show raw.where(lang: "python"): show-rule


You can optionally style ` <example-input> ` and ` <example-output> ` labels
to customize how input and output blocks appear. For even deeper
customization, you can specify the ` container ` that displays the input and
output blocks that accepts a keyword ` direction ` and positional ` input `
and ` output ` .

===  How to add

0.4.0

A package to create calendar with events.

CINECA Is Not an Electric Calendar App, but a Typst package to create
calendars with events.

==  Usage

The package now support creating events from ICS files (thanks @Geronymos). To
do so, read an ICS file and parse with ` ics-parser() ` .



    #let events2 = ics-parser(read("sample.ics")).map(event => (
      event.dtstart,
      event.dtstart,
      event.dtend,
      event.summary
    ))

    #calendar(events2, hour-range: (10, 14))


===  Day view

` calendar(events, hour-range, minute-height, template, stroke) `

Parameters:

  - ` events ` : An array of events. Each item is a 4-element array:
    - Date. Can be ` datetime() ` or valid args of ` day() ` .
    - Start time. Can be valid args of ` time() ` .
    - End time. Can be valid args of ` time() ` .
    - Event body. Can be anything. Passed to the template.body to show more details.
  - ` hour-range ` : Then range of hours, affacting the range of the calendar. Default: ` (8, 20) ` .
  - ` minute-height ` : Height of per minute. Each minute occupys a row. This number is to control the height of each row. Default: ` 0.8pt ` .
  - ` template ` : Templates for headers, times, or events. It takes a dictionary of the following entries: ` header ` , ` time ` , and ` event ` . Default: ` (:) ` .
  - ` stroke ` : A stroke style to control the style of the default stroke, or a function taking two parameters ` (x, y) ` to control the stroke. The first row is the dates, and the first column is the times. Default: ` none ` .

> [!NOTE] See below for more details about the format of start time and end
> time.

    )

    #calendar-month(
      events2,
      sunday-first: true,
      rows: (2em,) * 2 + (8em,),
      template: (

    - #time("8:10:08")

    - #day(2024)
    - #day(2024, 2)
    - #day(2024, 2, 5)    // year, month, day
    - #day("2024-3-7")    // ISO format (year-month-day)
    - #day("26/12/2024")  // British format (day/month/year)

    - #daytime(2024)
    - #daytime(2024, 2)
    - #daytime(2024, 2, 5)
    - #daytime(2024, 2, 5, 8)
    - #daytime(2024, 2, 5, 8, 10)
    - #daytime("2024-6-1", 8)
    - #daytime("2024-6-1", 8, 10)
    - #daytime("2024-6-1", 8, 10, 30)
    - #daytime(2024, "12:00")
    - #daytime(2024, 2, "12:00")
    - #daytime(2024, 2, 5, "12:00")

= *scrutinize.md*

=  scrutinize

0.3.0

A library for building exams, tests, etc. with Typst

Scrutinize is a library for building exams, tests, etc. with Typst. It has
three general areas of focus:

  - It helps with grading information: record the points that can be reached for each question and make them available for creating grading keys.
  - It provides a selection of question writing utilities, such as multiple choice or true/false questions.
  - It supports the creation of sample solutions by allowing to switch between the normal and âpre-filledâ exam.

Right now, providing a styled template is not part of this packageâs scope.
Also, visual customization of the provided question templates is currently
nonexistent.

See the [ manual
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scrutinize/0.3.0/docs/manual.pdf)
for details.

= *latedef.md*

=  latedef

0.1.0

Use now, define later

_Use now, define later!_

==  Basic usage

This package exposes a single function, ` latedef-setup ` .



    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(simple: true)

    My #undef is #undef.
    #def("dog")
    #def("cool")


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/latedef/0.1.0/example-
images/1.png)

Note that the definition doesnât actually have to come _after_ the usage,
but if you want to define something beforehand, youâre better off using a
variable instead.



    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(simple: true)

    // Instead of
    #def("A")
    The first letter is #undef.

    // you should use
    #let A = "A"
    The first letter is #A.


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/latedef/0.1.0/example-
images/2.png)

==  The ` simple ` parameter

When ` simple: false ` (which is the default), ` undef ` becomes a function
you have to call. It takes an optional positional or named parameter ` id ` of
type ` str ` , which can be used to define things out of order.



    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup() // or `latedef-setup(simple: false)`

    // Note that you can still call it without an id, which works just like when `simple: true`.
    My letters are #undef("1"), #undef(id: "2"), and #undef().

    // `def` now takes one positional and either another positional or a named parameter.
    #def("C")
    #def(id: "2", "B")
    #def("1", "A")


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/latedef/0.1.0/example-
images/3.png)

==  The ` footnote ` parameter

This is a convenience feature that automatically wraps ` undef ` in ` footnote
` , either directly (when ` simple: true ` ) or as a function (when ` simple:
false ` ).

This corresponds to LaTeXâs ` \footnotemark ` and ` \footnotetext ` , hence
the different names in the example.



    #let (fmark, ftext) = latedef-setup(simple: true, footnote: true)
    Do#fmark you#fmark believe#fmark in God?#fmark

    #let wdym = "What do you mean"
    #ftext[#wdym "Do"?]
    #ftext[#wdym "you"?]
    #ftext[#wdym "believe"?]
    #ftext[And w#wdym.slice(1) "God"?]


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/latedef/0.1.0/example-
images/4.png)

==  The ` stand-in ` parameter

This is a function that takes a single positional parameter ( ` id ` ) of type ` none | str ` and produces a stand-in value that gets shown when a late-defined value is missing a corresponding definition.


    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup()
    // This is the default stand-in
    #undef()
    #undef("with an id")

    // Custom stand-in
    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(stand-in: id => emph[No #id!])
    #undef()
    #undef("id")


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/latedef/0.1.0/example-
images/5.png)

Since ` stand-in ` is a function, which is only called when a definition is
actually missing, you can even set it to panic to enforce that all late-
defined values have a definiton.



    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(stand-in: id => panic("Missing definition for value with id " + repr(id)))
    #undef()
    #undef("id")


The output will look something like



    error: panicked with: "Missing definition for value with id none"
      ââ example.typ:1:50
      â
      â #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(stand-in: id => panic("Missing definition for value with id " + repr(id)))
      â                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    error: panicked with: "Missing definition for value with id \"id\""
      ââ example.typ:1:50
      â
      â #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(stand-in: id => panic("Missing definition for value with id " + repr(id)))
      â                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


And there is no error when everything has a definition:



    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(stand-in: id => panic("Missing definition for value with id " + repr(id)))
    #undef() is #undef("id").
    #def("This")
    #def("id", "fine")


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/latedef/0.1.0/example-
images/6.png)

==  The ` group ` parameter

Sometimes you may want to use multiple instances of ` latedef ` in parallel.
This is done using the ` group ` parameter, which can be ` none ` (the
default) or any ` str ` .

Note that using ` footnote: true ` sets the default group to ` "footnote" `
instead.



    // Use a group for the figure stuff...
    #let (caption-undef, caption) = latedef-setup(simple: true, group: "figure")
    #let figure = std.figure.with(caption: caption-undef)
    // ...so you can still use the regular mechanism in parallel.
    #let (undef, def) = latedef-setup(simple: true)

    #figure(raw(block: true, lorem(5)))
    #caption[The #undef _lorem ipsum_.]
    #def("classic")

![A preview of the clear-iclr Typst
template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/clear-
iclr-0.4.0-small.webp)

=  clear-iclr

0.4.0

Paper template for submission to International Conference on Learning
Representations (ICLR)

Featured  Template

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=clear-iclr&version=0.4.0)

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking _Start from
template_ on the dashboard and searching for ` clear-iclr ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/clear-iclr


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` iclr ` function with the following named
arguments.

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.

  - ` authors ` : An array of author dictionaries. Each of the author dictionaries must have a name key and can have the keys department, organization, location, and email.

        #let authors = (
      ...,
      (
        names: ([Coauthor1], [Coauthor2]),
        affilation: [Affiliation],
        address: [Address],
        email: "correspondent@example.org",
      ),
      ...
    )


  - ` keywords ` : Publication keywords (used in PDF metadata).

  - ` date ` : Creation date (used in PDF metadata).

  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or none. Appears at the top under the title.

  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the bibliography function or none. The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the paper.

  - ` appendix ` : Content to append after bibliography section (can be included).

  - ` accepted ` : If this is set to ` false ` then anonymized ready for submission document is produced; ` accepted: true ` produces camera-redy version. If the argument is set to ` none ` then preprint version is produced (can be uploaded to arXiv).

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` iclr `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule at the top of your file.

==  Issues

This template is developed at [ daskol/typst-templates
](https://github.com/daskol/typst-templates) repo. Please report all issues
there.

  - Common issue is related to Typstâs inablity to produce colored annotation. In order to mitigte the issue, we add a script which modifies annotations and make them colored.

        ../colorize-annotations.py \
        example-paper.typst.pdf example-paper-colored.typst.pdf


See [ [ README.md ](http://readme.md/) ][3] for details.

  - The author instructions says that preferable font is MS Times New Roman but the official example paper uses serifs like Computer Modern and Nimbus font families. Monospace fonts are not specified.

  - ICML-like bibliography style. The bibliography slightly differs from the one in the original example paper. The main difference is that we prefer to use authorâs lastname at first place to search an entry faster.

0.1.5

An official report template for the 'Informatique et systÃ¨mes de
communication' (ISC) bachelor degree programme at the School of Engineering
(HEI) in Sion, Switzerland.

](https://hevs.ch/isc)

This is an official template for students reports for the [ ISC degree
programme ](https://isc.hevs.ch/) at the School of engineering in Sion.

==  Using the template

In the ` Typst ` web application, start with the ` isc-hei-report ` and voilÃ
! Using the CLI, you can initialize the project with the command :



    typst init @preview/isc-hei-report:0.1.5


This template will initialize an sample report with sensible default values.

==  Installing fonts locally

If you are running ` typst ` locally, you might miss some of the required
fonts. For your convenience, a font download script is included in this repos.
As all the fonts are released under the [ SIL Open Font License
](https://openfontlicense.org/) , there are no file inclusion issues here.

To the install the fonts locally in a Linux environment, simply type



    source install_fonts.sh


from within the ` fonts ` directory.

==  PDF images inclusion

Unfortunately, ` typst ` does not support PDF file types inclusion at the time
of writing this documentation. As a temporary workaround, PDF files can be
converted to SVG via ` pdf2svg ` .

When used locally, creating a PDF is straightforward with the command



    typst compile report.typ


Even nicer, the following command compiles the report every time the file is
modified.



    typst watch report.typ


Another nice possibility is of course to use a VScod[e | ium] via the ` Typst LSP ` plugin which enables direct compilation.

In the future, several things _might_ be updated, such as :

  - [ ] State diagrams and UML diagrams examples
  - [ ] Glossary inclusion
  - [ ] Master thesis version of this template
  - [ ] Themes for code
  - [ ] Other nice things
  - [x] Appendix
  - [x] Acronyms inclusion
  - [x] Basic support for including code files

If you need any help for installing or running those tools, do not hesitate to
get in touch with its maintainer [ pmudry ](https://github.com/pmudry) .

You can of course also propose changes using PR or raise issues if something
is not clear. Have fun writing reports!

Randziffern in Typst

[ _Randziffern_
](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Randnummer&oldid=231943223) (also
called _Randnummern_ ) are a way to reference text passages in a document,
independent of the page number or the section number. They are used in many
German legal texts, for example. This package provides a way to create
_Randziffern_ in Typst.

==  Demo

![left page with Randziffern on the left of the text](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/jurz/0.1.0/demo-2.svg) |  ![right page with Randziffern on the right of the text](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/jurz/0.1.0/demo-3.svg)
---|---
View source



    #show: init-jurz.with(
      gap: 1em,
      two-sided: true
    )

    #rz #lorem(50)

    #lorem(20)

    #rz<abc> #lorem(30)

    #rz #lorem(40)

    #rz #lorem(50)

    #lorem(20)

    #rz #lorem(24)

    Fur further information, look at @abc.


==  Reference

===  ` init-jurz `

A show rule that initializes the _Randziffern_ for the document. This rule
should be placed at the beginning of the document. It also allows customizing
the behavior of the _Randziffern_ .

====  Usage



    #show: init-jurz.with(
     // parameters
     // two-sided: true,
     // gap: 1em,
     // supplement: "Rz.",
     // reset-level: 0,
    )


====  Parameters

  - ` two-sided ` (optional): If ` true ` , the _Randziffern_ are placed on the outer margin of the page. If ` false ` , they are placed on the left margin. Default is ` true ` .
  - ` gap ` (optional): The distance between the _Randziffer_ and the text. Default is ` 1em ` .
  - ` supplement ` (optional): The text that is placed before the _Randziffer_ when referencing it. Default is ` "Rz." ` .
  - ` reset-level ` (optional): The heading level at which the _Randziffern_ are reset. If set to ` 3 ` , for example, the numbering of the _Randziffern_ restarts after every heading of levels ` 1 ` , ` 2 ` , or ` 3 ` . Default is ` 0 ` .

===  ` rz `

Adds a _Randziffer_ to the text. The _Randziffer_ is a unique identifier that
can be referenced in the text.

You can add references the same way you can with headings. In fact, the
_Randziffer_ is treated as a heading of level ` 99 ` under the hood.

====  Usage



    #rz #lorem(100)
    #rz<abc> #lorem(100)

    See also @abc.

_NOTE: For online editor, Source Sans Pro are already included; however you
will still have to manually upload the` .otf ` or ` .ttf ` files of
*Fontawesome* and *Roboto* to your project, by creating a folder ` fonts `
and put all the ` otf ` files there. See [ Issue
](https://github.com/typst/webapp-issues/issues/401) _

===  2\. Check Documentation

A [ documentation ](https://mintyfrankie.github.io/brilliant-CV/docs.pdf) on
CV functions is provided for reference.

===  3\. Bootstrap Template

You have two ways to bootstrap the template, according to your need and tech-
savvy level.

====  3.1 With Typst CLI

In your local system, just working like ` git clone ` , boostrap the template
using this command:



    typst init @preview/brilliant-cv:


Replace the ` <version> ` with the latest or any releases (after 2.0.0).

====  3.2 With ` utpm ` pakcage manager

[ utpm ](https://github.com/Thumuss/utpm) is a WIP packager manager for Typst.
Install it with official instructions.

Git clone then this repository on your local system, and within the workspace,
run ` utpm workspace link --force ` .

You will have to take care of templating by yourself, though.

===  4\. Compile Files

Adapt the ` metadata.toml ` to suit your needs, then ` typst c cv.typ ` to get
your first CV!

===  5\. Beyond

It is recommended to:

  1. Use ` git ` to manage your project, as it helps trace your changes and version control your CV.
  2. Use ` typstyle ` and ` pre-commit ` to help you format your CV.
  3. Use ` typos ` to check typos in your CV if your main locale is English.
  4. (Advanced) Use ` LTex ` in your favorite code editor to check grammars and get language suggestions.

==  How to upgrade version

For the time being, upgrade can be achieved by manually âfind and replaceâ
the import statements in batch in your favorite IDE. For example:



    #import "@preview/brilliant-cv:2.0.0" -> #import "@preview/brilliant-cv:2.0.3"


*Make sure you read the release notes to notice any breaking changes. We
estimate that there would still be some as Typst has not reached to a stable
release neither.*

==  Migration from ` v1 `

> The version ` v1 ` is now deprecated, due to the compliance to Typst
> Packages standard. However, if you want to continue to develop on the older
> version, please refer to the ` v1-legacy ` branch.

With an existing CV project using the ` v1 ` version of the template, a
migration is needed, including replacing some files / some content in certain
files.

  1. Delete ` brilliant-CV ` folder, ` .gitmodules ` . (Future package management will directly be managed by Typst)
  2. Migrate all the config on ` metadata.typ ` by creating a new ` metadata.toml ` . Follow the example toml file in the repo, it is rather straightforward to migrate.
  3. For ` cv.typ ` and ` letter.typ ` , copy the new files from the repo, and adapt the modules you have in your project.
  4. For the module files in ` /modules_* ` folders:
    1. Delete the old import ` #import "../brilliant-CV/template.typ": * ` , and replace it by the import statements in the new template files.
    2. Due to the Typst path handling mecanism, one cannot directly pass the path string to some functions anymore. This concerns, for example, the ` logo ` argument in ` cvEntry ` , but also on ` cvPublication ` as well. Some parameter names were changed, but most importantly, *you should pass a function instead of a string (i.e.` image("logo.png") ` instead of ` "logo.png" ` ). * Refer to new template files for reference.
  5. You might need to install ` Roboto ` and ` Source Sans Pro ` on your local system now, as new Typst package discourages including these large files.
  6. Run ` typst c cv.typ ` without passing the ` font-path ` flag. All should be good now, congrats!

Feel free to raise an issue for more assistance should you encounter a problem
that you cannot solve on your own :)

Tetris game in Typst

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=soviet-matrix&version=0.1.1)

This is a classic Tetris game implemented using Typst. The goal is to
manipulate falling blocks to create and clear horizontal lines without letting
the blocks stack up to the top of the playing field.

![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/soviet-
matrix/0.1.1/demo.gif)

==  How to Play

You can play the game in two ways:

  1. *Online:*

     - Visit [ https://typst.app/app?template=soviet-matrix&version=0.1.0 ](https://typst.app/app?template=soviet-matrix&version=0.1.0) .
     - Enter any title of your choice and click *Create* .
  2. *Locally:*

     - Open your command line interface.
     - Run the following command:

                typst init @preview/soviet-matrix


     - Typst will create a new directory.
     - Open ` main.typ ` in the created directory.
     - Use the [ Typst Preview VS Code extension ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgt19937.typst-preview) for live preview and gameplay.

Enjoy the game!

==  Controls

  - Move Left: a
  - Move Right: d
  - Soft Drop: s
  - Hard Drop: f
  - Rotate Left: q
  - Rotate Right: e
  - 180-degree Rotate: w

==  Changing the Game Seed

If you want to play different game scenarios, you can change the game seed
using the following method:



    #import "@preview/soviet-matrix:0.1.0": game
    #show: game.with(seed: 123) // Change the game seed


Replace ` 123 ` with any number of your choice.

==  Changing Key Bindings

Modify the ` actions ` parameter in the ` game.with ` method to change the key
bindings. The default key bindings are as follows:



    #show: game.with(seed: 0, actions: (
      left: ("a", ),
      right: ("d", ),
      down: ("s", ),
      left-rotate: ("q", ),
      right-rotate: ("e", ),
      half-turn: ("w", ),
      fast-drop: ("f", ),
    ))

0.2.0

A package to draw sequence diagrams with CeTZ

A Typst package to draw sequence diagrams with CeTZ

- * *

This package lets you render sequence diagrams directly in Typst. The
following boilerplate code creates an empty sequence diagram with two
participants:

*Typst* |  *Result*
---|---


    #import "@preview/chronos:0.2.0"
    #chronos.diagram({
      import chronos: *
      _par("Alice")
      _par("Bob")
    })


|
![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/chronos/0.2.0/gallery/readme/boilerplate.png)

> _Disclaimer_
>  The package cannot parse PlantUML syntax for the moment, and thus requires
> the use of element functions, as shown in the examples. A PlantUML parser is
> in the TODO list, just not the top priority

==  Basic sequences

You can make basic sequences using the ` _seq ` function:

*Typst* |  *Result*
---|---


    #chronos.diagram({
      import chronos: *
      _par("Alice")
      _par("Bob")

      _seq("Alice", "Bob", comment: "Hello")
      _seq("Bob", "Bob", comment: "Think")
      _seq("Bob", "Alice", comment: "Hi")
    })


|
![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/chronos/0.2.0/gallery/readme/simple_sequence.png)

You can make lifelines using the following parameters of the ` _seq `
function:

  - ` enable-dst ` : enables the destination lifeline
  - ` create-dst ` : creates the destination lifeline and participant
  - ` disable-dst ` : disables the destination lifeline
  - ` destroy-dst ` : destroys the destination lifeline and participant
  - ` disable-src ` : disables the source lifeline
  - ` destroy-src ` : destroy the source lifeline and participant

*Typst* |  *Result*
---|---


    #chronos.diagram({
      import chronos: *
      _par("A", display-name: "Alice")
      _par("B", display-name: "Bob")
      _par("C", display-name: "Charlie")
      _par("D", display-name: "Derek")

      _seq("A", "B", comment: "hello", enable-dst: true)
      _seq("B", "B", comment: "self call", enable-dst: true)
      _seq("C", "B", comment: "hello from thread 2", enable-dst: true, lifeline-style: (fill: rgb("#005500")))
      _seq("B", "D", comment: "create", create-dst: true)
      _seq("B", "C", comment: "done in thread 2", disable-src: true, dashed: true)
      _seq("B", "B", comment: "rc", disable-src: true, dashed: true)
      _seq("B", "D", comment: "delete", destroy-dst: true)
      _seq("B", "A", comment: "success", disable-src: true, dashed: true)
    })

= *crudo.md*

=  crudo

0.1.1

Take slices from raw blocks

Crudo allows conveniently working with ` raw ` blocks in terms of individual
lines. It allows you to e.g.

  - filter lines by content
  - filter lines by range (slicing)
  - transform lines
  - join multiple raw blocks

While transforming the content, the original [ parameters
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/raw/#parameters) specified on the
given raw block will be preserved.

==  Getting Started

The full version of this example can be found in [ gallery/thumbnail.typ
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/crudo/0.1.1/gallery/thumbnail.typ)
.



    From

    #let preamble = ```typ
    #import "@preview/crudo:0.1.0"

    ```
    #preamble

    and

    #let example = ````typ
    #crudo.r2l(```c
    int main() {
      return 0;
    }
    ```)
    ````
    #example

    we get

    #let full-example = crudo.join(preamble, example)
    #full-example

    If you execute that, you get

    #eval(full-example.text, mode: "markup")


![Example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/crudo/0.1.1/thumbnail.png)

==  Usage

See the [ manual
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/crudo/0.1.1/docs/manual.pdf)
for details.

===  How to add

  4. [ Contributing ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/ttuile/0.1.1/#-contributing)

==  ð Usage

This template targets french students, thus labels will be in french, see [
Notes
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/ttuile/0.1.1/#-notes)
.

It is available on _Typst Universe_ : [ ` @preview/ttuile:0.1.1 `
](https://typst.app/universe/package/ttuile) .

If you wish to use it in a fully local manner, youâll need to either
manually include ` ttuile.typ ` and ` logo-insa-lyon.png ` in your projectâs
root directory ; or upload them to the _Typst web app_ if thatâs what you
use.

Youâll find these files in the [ releases
](https://github.com/vitto4/ttuile/releases) section.

Your folder structure should then look something like this :



    .
    âââ ttuile.typ
    âââ logo-insa-lyon.png
    âââ main.typ


The template is now ready to be used, and can be called supplying the
following arguments. ` ? ` means the argument can be null if not applicable.

Argument  |  Default value  |  Type  |  Description
---|---|---|---
` titre ` |  ` none ` |  ` content? ` |  The title of your report.
` auteurs ` |  ` none ` |  ` array<str> | content? ` |  One or multiple authors to be credited in the report.
` groupe ` |  ` none ` |  ` content? ` |  Your class number/letter/identifier. Will be displayed right after the author(s).
` numero-tp ` |  ` none ` |  ` content? ` |  The number/identifier of the lab work/practical youâre writing this report for.
` numero-poste ` |  ` none ` |  ` content? ` |  Number of your lab bench.
` date ` |  ` none ` |  ` datetime | content? ` |  Date at which the lab work/practical was carried out.
` sommaire ` |  ` true ` |  ` bool ` |  Display the table of contents ?
` logo ` |  ` image("logo-insa-lyon.png") ` |  ` image? ` |  University logo to use.
` point-legende ` |  ` false ` |  ` bool ` |  Enable automatic enforcement of full stops at the end of figuresâ captions. (still somewhat experimental).

A single positional argument is accepted, being the reportâs body.

You can call the template using the following syntax :



    // Local import
    // #import "ttuile.typ": *

    // Universe import
    #import "@preview/ttuile:0.1.1": *

    #show: ttuile.with(
      titre: [Â« #lorem(8) Â»],
      auteurs: (
          "Theresa Tungsten",
          "Jean Dupont",
          "Eugene Deklan",
      ),
      groupe: "TD0",
      numero-tp: 0,
      numero-poste: "0",
      date: datetime.today(),
      // sommaire: false,
      // logo: image("path_to/logo.png"),
      // point-legende: true,
    )


==  ð Documentation

The package ` ttuile.typ ` exposes multiple functions, find out more about
them in the _documentation_ .

[ To the documentation ](https://github.com/vitto4/ttuile/blob/main/DOC.EN.md)

An example file is also available in [ ` template/main.typ `
](https://github.com/vitto4/ttuile/blob/main/template/main.typ)

==  ð Notes

  - Beware, all of the labels will be in french (authors != auteurs, appendix != annexe, â¦)

  - If you really want to use this template despite not being an INSA student, you can probably figure out what to change in the code (namely labels mentioned above). You can remove the INSA logo by setting ` logo: none `

Should you still need help, no worries, feel free to reach out !

  - The code - variable names and comments - is all in french. Thatâs on me, I didnât really think it through when first writing the template haha. I might consider translating sometime in the future.

  - The MIT license doesnât apply to the file ` logo-insa-lyon.png ` , it was retrieved from [ INSA Lyon - Ã©lÃ©ments graphiques ](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/fr/elements-graphiques) . It doesnât apply either to the âINSAâ branding.

==  ð§© Contributing

Contributions are welcome ! Parts of the template are very much spaghetti
code, especially where the spacing between different headings is handled
(seriously, itâs pretty bad).

If you know the proper way of doing this, an issue or PR would be greatly
appreciated :)

Unofficial template for writing a report in the HAW Hamburg department of
Computer Science design.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=haw-hamburg-report&version=0.3.1)

This is an *` unofficial ` * template for writing a report in the ` HAW
Hamburg ` department of ` Computer Science ` design using [ Typst
](https://github.com/typst/typst) .

==  Required Fonts

To correctly render this template please make sure that the ` New Computer
Modern ` font is installed on your system.

==  Usage

To use this package just add the following code to your [ Typst
](https://github.com/typst/typst) document:



    #import "@preview/haw-hamburg:0.3.1": report

    #show: report.with(
      language: "en",
      title: "Example title",
      author:"Example author",
      faculty: "Engineering and Computer Science",
      department: "Computer Science",
      include-declaration-of-independent-processing: true,
    )


==  How to Compile

This project contains an example setup that splits individual chapters into
different files.
This can cause problems when using references etc.
These problems can be avoided by following these steps:

  - Make sure to always compile your ` main.typ ` file which includes all of your chapters for references to work correctly.
  - VSCode:
    - Install the [ Tinymist Typst ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extension.
    - Make sure to start the ` PDF ` or ` Live Preview ` only from within your ` main.typ ` file.
    - If problems occur it usually helps to close the preview and restart it from your ` main.typ ` file.

    #set page(width: auto, height: auto)

    = tiÃ¡o mÇ

    #tiaoma.ean("1234567890128")


![example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tiaoma/0.2.1/example.svg)

==  Manual

Please refer to [ manual
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tiaoma/0.2.1/manual.pdf)
for more details.

==  Alternatives

There are other barcode/qrcode packages for typst such as:

  - [ https://github.com/jneug/typst-codetastic ](https://github.com/jneug/typst-codetastic)
  - [ https://github.com/Midbin/cades ](https://github.com/Midbin/cades)

Packages differ in provided customization options for generated barcodes. This
package is limited by zint functionality, which focuses more on coverage than
customization (e.g. inserting graphics into QR codes). Patching upstream zint
code is (currently) outside of the scope of this package - if it doesnât
provide functionality you need, check the rest of the typst ecosystem to see
if itâs available elsewhere or request it [ upstream
](https://github.com/zint/zint) and [ notify us ](https://github.com/Enter-
tainer/zint-wasi/issues) when itâs been merged.

===  Pros

  1. Support for far greater number of barcode types (all provided by zint library)
  2. Should be faster as is uses a WASM plugin which bundles zint code which is written in C; others are written in pure typst or javascript.

===  Cons

  1. While most if not all of zint functionality is covered, itâs hard to guarantee thereâs no overlooked functionality.
  2. This package uses typst plugin system and has a WASM backend written in Rust which makes is less welcoming for new contributors.

0.1.0

Style matrices with custom paths, strokes and fills for appealing
visualizations.

Featured  Package

![pavement +
matrix](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pavemat/0.1.0/examples/logo.svg)

repo: [ https://github.com/QuadnucYard/pavemat
](https://github.com/QuadnucYard/pavemat)

==  Introduction

The _pavemat_ is a tool for creating styled matrices with custom paths,
strokes, and fills. It allows users to define how paths should be drawn
through the matrix, apply different strokes to these paths, and fill specific
cells with various colors. This function is particularly useful for
visualizing complex data structures, mathematical matrices, and creating
custom grid layouts.

==  Examples

The logo example:



    #{
      set math.mat(row-gap: 0.25em, column-gap: 0.1em)
      set text(size: 2em)

      pavemat(
        pave: (
          "SDS(dash: 'solid')DDD]WW",
          (path: "sdDDD", stroke: aqua.darken(30%))
        ),
        stroke: (dash: "dashed", thickness: 1pt, paint: yellow),
        fills: (
          "0-0": green.transparentize(80%),
          "1-1": blue.transparentize(80%),
          "[0-0]": green.transparentize(60%),
          "[1-1]": blue.transparentize(60%),
        ),
        delim: "[",
      )[$mat(P, a, v, e; "", m, a, t)$]
    }

0.1.1

Replace letters in equations with fruit emoji

Make your equations more fruity!

This package automatically replaces any single letters in equations with fruit
emoji.

Refer to [ ` example-documentation.pdf `
](https://codeberg.org/T0mstone/typst-fruitify/src/tag/0.1.1/example-
documentation.pdf) for more detail.

==  Emoji support

Until 0.12, typst did not have good emoji support for PDF. This meant that
even though this package worked as intended, the output would look very wrong
when exporting to PDF. Therefore, it is recommended to stick with PNG export
for those older typst versions.

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` fruitify `

    Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

    die von mir bei den Werbekosten geltend gemachte Abschreibung fÃ¼r den im
    vergangenen Jahr angeschafften Fotokopierer wurde von Ihnen nicht berÃ¼cksichtigt.
    Der Fotokopierer steht in meinem BÃ¼ro und wird von mir ausschlieÃlich zu beruflichen
    Zwecken verwendet.

    Ich lege deshalb Einspruch gegen den oben genannten Einkommensteuerbescheid ein
    und bitte Sie, die Abschreibung anzuerkennen.

    Anbei erhalten Sie eine Kopie der Rechnung des GerÃ¤tes.

    Mit freundlichen GrÃ¼Ãen
    #v(1cm)

= *one-liner.md*

=  one-liner

0.1.0

Automatically adjust the text size to make it fit on one line filling the
available space.

One-liner is a package containing a helper function to fit text to the
available width, without wrapping, by adjusting the text size based upon the
context. This is useful in templates where you donât know the length of text
that is supposed to fit in specific locations in your template.

==  Example

In the current version(0.1.0) one-liner contains 1 function: fit-to-width that
can used as follows:



    #import "@preview/one-liner:0.1.0": fit-to-width

    #block(
      height: 3cm,
      width: 10cm,
      fill: luma(230),
      inset: 8pt,
      radius: 4pt,
      align(horizon + center,fit-to-width(lorem(2))),
    )


Here we have a block of specific dimensions. Using fit-to-width will change
the font-size to the content passed to fit-to-width will fit the full width
without wrapping the content.

![Example1](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/one-
liner/0.1.0/img/example1.png)

==  fit-to-width function

Besides content the function has two parameters:

_max-text-size_ of type length. It has a default of 64pt. When fit-to-width is
limited by the max-text-size you will see that not the entire width of space
is used.

_min-text-size_ of type length. It has a default of 4pt. When fit-to-width is
limited by the min-text-size you will see that the text will wrap, because the
min-text-size is bigger than the size that would be required to prevent
wrapping.

==  Disclaimer

This package was only tested in a few of my own documents and only to fit
text. Not tested with other content yet.

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` one-liner `



    #import "@preview/one-liner:0.1.0"

= *numbly.md*

=  numbly

0.1.0

A package that helps you to specify different numbering formats for different
levels of headings.

A package that helps you to specify different numbering formats for different
levels of headings.

Suppose you want to specify the following numbering format for your document:

  - Appendix A. Guide
    - A.1. Installation
      - Step 1. Download
      - Step 2. Install
    - A.2. Usage

You might use ` if ` to achieve this:



    #set heading(numbering: (..nums) => {
      nums = nums.pos()
      if nums.len() == 1 {
        return "Appendix " + numbering("A.", ..nums)
      } else if nums.len() == 2 {
        return numbering("A.1.", ..nums)
      } else {
        return "Step " + numbering("1.", nums.last())
      }
    })

    = Guide
    == Installation
    === Download
    === Install
    == Usage


But with ` numbly ` , you can do this more easily:



    #import "@preview/numbly:0.1.0": numbly
    #set heading(numbering: numbly(
      "Appendix {1:A}.", // use {level:format} to specify the format
      "{1:A}.{2}.", // if format is not specified, arabic numbers will be used
      "Step {3}.", // here, we only want the 3rd level
    ))


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` numbly `



    #import "@preview/numbly:0.1.0"

= *clatter.md*

=  clatter

0.1.0

Just the PDF417 generator from rxing.

clatter is a simple Typst package for generating PDF417 barcodes, utilizing
the [ rxing ](https://github.com/rxing-core/rxing) library.

==  Features

  - *Easy to Use* : The package provides a single, intuitive function to generate barcodes.
  - *Flexible Sizing* : Control the size of the barcode with optional width and height parameters.
  - *Customizable Orientation* : Barcodes can be rendered horizontally or vertically, with automatic adjustment based on size.

==  Usage

The primary function provided by this package is ` pdf417 ` .

===  Parameters

  - ` text ` (required): The text to encode in the barcode.
  - ` width ` (optional): The desired width of the barcode.
  - ` height ` (optional): The desired height of the barcode.
  - ` direction ` (optional): Sets the orientation of the barcode, either ` "horizontal" ` or ` "vertical" ` . If not specified, the orientation is automatically determined based on the provided dimensions.

===  Sizing Behavior

  - By default, the barcode is rendered horizontally at a reasonable size.
  - If both ` width ` and ` height ` are provided, the barcode will fit within the specified dimensions (i.e. ` fit: "contain" ` ).
  - If the ` height ` is greater than the ` width ` , the barcode will automatically switch to vertical orientation unless ` direction ` is manually set.

===  Example Usage



    #import "@preview/clatter:0.1.0": pdf417

    // Generate a sized horizontal PDF417 barcode
    // Note: The specified size may not be exact, as the barcode will fit within the box, maintaining its aspect ratio.
    #pdf417("sized-barcode", width: 50mm, height: 20mm)

    // Generate a vertical barcode
    #pdf417("vertical-barcode", direction: "vertical")

    // Generate a barcode and position it on the page
    #place(top + right, pdf417("absolutely-positioned-barcode", width: 50mm), dx: -5mm, dy: 5mm)

= *pinit.md*

=  pinit

0.2.2

Relative positioning by pins, especially useful for making slides in typst.

Featured  Package

Relative positioning by pins, especially useful for making slides in typst.

==  Example

===  Pin things as you like

Have a look at the source [ here
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pinit/0.2.2/examples/example.typ)
.

![Example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pinit/0.2.2/examples/example.png)

===  Dynamic Slides

Pinit works with [ Touying ](https://github.com/touying-typ/touying) or [
Polylux ](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/polylux) animations.

Have a look at the pdf file [ here ](https://github.com/OrangeX4/typst-
pinit/blob/main/examples/example.pdf) .

![Example
Pages](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pinit/0.2.2/examples/example-
pages.png)

==  Usage

===  Examples

The idea of pinit is pinning pins on the normal flow of the text, and then
placing the content on the page by ` absolute-place ` function.

For example, we can highlight text and add a tip by pins simply:



    #import "@preview/pinit:0.2.2": *

    #set text(size: 24pt)

    A simple #pin(1)highlighted text#pin(2).

    #pinit-highlight(1, 2)

    #pinit-point-from(2)[It is simple.]


![simple-
demo](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pinit/0.2.2/examples/simple-
demo.png)

If you want to place the content relative to the center of some pins, you use
a array of pins:



    #import "@preview/pinit:0.2.2": *

    #set text(size: 12pt)

    A simple #pin(1)highlighted text#pin(2).

    #pinit-highlight(1, 2)

    #pinit-point-from((1, 2))[It is simple.]


![simple-
demo2](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pinit/0.2.2/examples/simple-
demo2.png)

A more complex example, Have a look at the source [ here
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pinit/0.2.2/examples/equation-
desc.typ) .

desc](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pinit/0.2.2/examples/equation-
desc.png)

===  Fletcher edge support

[ Fletcher ](https://github.com/Jollywatt/typst-fletcher) is a powerful Typst
package for drawing diagrams with arrows. We can use fletcher to draw more
complex arrows.

[ ` pinit-fletcher-edge `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pinit/0.2.2/#pinit-
fletcher-edge)



    #import "@preview/pinit:0.2.2": *
    #import "@preview/fletcher:0.5.1"

    Con#pin(1)#h(4em)#pin(2)nect

    #pinit-fletcher-edge(
      fletcher, 1, end: 2, (1, 0), [bend], bend: -20deg, "<->",
      decorations: fletcher.cetz.decorations.wave.with(amplitude: .1),
    )


![fletcher](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pinit/0.2.2/examples/fletcher.png)

===  Pinit for raw

In the code block, we need to use a regex trick to get pinit to work, for
example



    #show raw: it => {
      show regex("pin\d"): it => pin(eval(it.text.slice(3)))
      it
    }

    `print(pin1"hello, world"pin2)`

    #pinit-highlight(1, 2)


![equation-
desc](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pinit/0.2.2/examples/pinit-
for-raw.png)

Note that typstâs code highlighting breaks up the text, causing overly
complex regular expressions such as â#pin(.*?)â to not work properly.

However, you may want to consider putting it in a comment to avoid
highlighting the text and breaking it up.

==  Notice

*Since Typst does not provide a reliable` absolute-place ` function, you may
consider taking the following steps if a MISALIGNMENT occurs: *

  1. *You could try to add a` #box() ` after the ` #pinit-xxx ` function call, like ` #pinit-xxx()#box() ` . *
  2. *You should add a blank line before the` #pinit-xxx ` function call, otherwise it will cause misalignment. *
  3. *You can try moving` #pinit-xxx() ` in front of or behind ` #pin() ` , or otherwhere, in short, try more. *
  4. *Try to add a offset to the` dx ` or ` dy ` argument of ` #pinit-xxx ` function by yourself. *
  5. *Open an issue if you have any questions you canât solve.*

*Arguments:*

  - ` fletcher ` (module): The Fletcher module. You can import it with something like ` #import "@preview/fletcher:0.5.1" `
  - ` start ` (pin): The starting pin of the edge. It is assumed that the pin is at the _origin point (0, 0)_ of the edge.
  - ` end ` (pin): The ending pin of the edge. If not provided, the edge will use default values for the width and height.
  - ` start-dx ` (length): The x-offset of the starting pin. You should use pt units.
  - ` start-dy ` (length): The y-offset of the starting pin. You should use pt units.
  - ` end-dx ` (length): The x-offset of the ending pin. You should use pt units.
  - ` end-dy ` (length): The y-offset of the ending pin. You should use pt units.
  - ` width-scale ` (percent): The width scale of the edge. The default value is 100%. If you set the width scale to 50%, the width of the edge will be half of the default width. Then you can use ` "r,r" ` which is equivalent to single ` "r" ` .
  - ` height-scale ` (percent): The height scale of the edge. The default value is 100%.
  - ` default-width ` (length): The default width of the edge. The default value is 30pt, which will only be used if the end pin is not provided or the width is 0pt or 0em.
  - ` default-height ` (length): The default height of the edge. The default value is 30pt, which will only be used if the end pin is not provided or the height is 0pt or 0em.
  - ` ..args ` (any): An edgeâs positional arguments may specify:
    - the edgeâs #param[edge][vertices], each specified with a CeTZ-style coordinate
    - the #param[edge][label] content
    - arrow #param[edge][marks], like ` "=>" ` or ` "<<-|-o" `
    - other style flags, like ` "double" ` or ` "wave" `

==  Changelog

===  0.2.2

  - Fix bugs.

===  0.2.1

  - To be compatible with Typst 0.12.

===  0.2.0

  - *Breaking changes* : ` #pinit(pins, func) ` is replaced by ` #pinit(callback: none, ..pins) ` and the callback argument will receive an ` (..positions) => { .. } ` function instead of a ` (positions) => { .. } ` function.
    - *Migration* : you need to use a named argument ` callback: (..positions) => { .. } ` to specify the callback function.
    - *Migration* : you cannot use a array as a pin name. Now ` #pinit((pin1, pin2), callback: func) ` means that we use ` pin1 ` and ` pin2 ` as a group of pins, and the callback function will receive *a single position* (the center of the bounding box of ` pin1 ` and ` pin2 ` ).
    - *Benefit* : you can use ` #pinit(pin1, pin2, callback: func) ` to query the positions of ` pin1 ` and ` pin2 ` separately, and ` #pinit((pin1, pin2), callback: func) ` to query the position of the center of the bounding box of ` pin1 ` and ` pin2 ` .
  - Add ` pinit-fletcher-edge ` function to draw a connecting line or arc in an fletcher arrow diagram.
  - Add ` double-arrow ` function and ` pinit-double-arrow ` function.
  - Add ` double ` argument for ` pinit-point-to ` and ` pinit-point-from ` functions.
  - Better comments and documentation.

===  0.1.4

  - Update documentation.

===  0.1.3

  - Add ` pinit-line-to ` function.

===  0.1.2

  - Add em unit support for ` simple-arrow ` .

===  0.1.1

===  0.1.0

  - Initial release.

= *grayness.md*

=  grayness

0.2.0

Simple image editing capabilities like converting to grayscale and cropping
via a WASM plugin.

A package providing simple image editing capabilities via a WASM plugin.

Available functionality includes converting images to grayscale, cropping and
flipping the images. Furthermore, this package supports adding transparency
and bluring (very slow) as well as handling additional raster image formats.

The package name is inspired by the blurry, gray images of Nessie, the [ Loch
Ness Monster ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness_Monster)

==  Usage

Due to the way typst currently interprets given paths, you have to read the
images yourself in the calling typst file. This raw imagedata can then be
passed to the grayness-package functions, like grayscale-image. These
functions also optionally accept all additional parameters of the original
typst image function like ` width ` or ` height ` :



    #import "@preview/grayness:0.2.0": grayscale-image

    #let data = read("Art.webp", encoding: none)
    #grayscale-image(data, width: 50%)


A detailed descriptions of all available functions is provided in the [ manual
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/grayness/0.2.0/manual.pdf)
.

You can also use the built-in help functions provided by tidy:



    #import "@preview/grayness:0.2.0": *
    #help("flip-image-vertical")


The ` grayscale-image ` function also works with SVG images. To do so you must
specify the format as ` "svg" ` :



    #let data = read("example.svg", encoding: none)
    #grayscale-image(data, format: "svg")


==  Examples

Here are several functions applied to a WEBP image of [ Arturo Nieto Dorantes
](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arturo_Nieto-Dorantes.webp) (CC-By-
SA 4.0): ![Example image
manipulations](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/grayness/0.2.0/example.png)

DIP chip labels for Typst

Salsa Dip is a library for making [ DIP
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_in-line_package) chip labels in Typst.



    #import "@preview/salsa-dip:0.1.0": dip-chip-label

    #set text(font: ("JetBrains Mono", "Fira Code", "DejaVu Sans Mono"), weight: "extrabold")
    #set page(width: auto, height: auto, margin: .125cm)

    #let z80-labels = ("A11", ..., "A9", "A10")

    #dip-chip-label(40, 0.54in, z80-labels, "Z80", settings: (pin-number-margin: 1pt, pin-number-size: 2.5pt, chip-label-size: 5pt))



![Z80 Chip
Label](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/salsa-
dip/0.1.0/examples/z80.png)



    #import "@preview/salsa-dip:0.1.0": dip-chip-label

    #set text(font: ("JetBrains Mono", "Fira Code", "DejaVu Sans Mono"), weight: "extrabold")
    #set page(width: auto, height: auto, margin: .125cm)

    #let labels = ("1A", "1B", "1Y", "2A", "2B", "2Y", "GND", "3Y", "3A", "3B", "4Y", "4A", "4B", "VCC")
    #dip-chip-label(14, 0.24in, labels, "74LS00")


![74ls00 Chip
Label](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/salsa-
dip/0.1.0/examples/74ls00.png)

The ` dip-chip-label ` function is called with four parameters, an integer
number of pins for the chip, the width (usually ` 0.24in ` or ` 0.54in ` ),
the list of pin labels (if no labels are desired, an empty array can be
passed), and the chip label.

There is an additional ` settings ` parameter which can be used to fine tune
the apperance of the chip labels. The ` settings ` parameter is a dictionary
optionally containing any of the setting keys:

  - ` chip-label-size ` : Font size for the chip label
  - ` pin-number-margin ` : Margin to give next to pin numbers
  - ` pin-number-size ` : Font size for pin numbers
  - ` pin-label-size ` : Font size for pin labels
  - ` include-numbers ` : Boolean enabling pin numbers
  - ` pin-spacing ` : Spacing of pins
  - ` vertical-margin ` : Total margin to put into spacing above and below pin labels

0.2.0

A Master's thesis template for Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST)

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=thesist&version=0.2.0)

ThesIST (pronounced âdesistâ) is an unofficial Masterâs thesis template
for Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico written in Typst.

This template fully meets the official formatting requirements as outlined [
here ](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/files/2021/09/guia-disserta-o-mestrado.pdf)
, and also attempts to follow most unwritten conventions. Regardless, you can
be on the lookout for things you may want to see added.

PIC2 reports are also supported. However, some conventions for these may vary
with the supervisors, so please check with them if anything needs to be
changed.

==  Changelogs

The changelogs of new versions are available on [ the Releases page
](https://github.com/tfachada/thesist/releases) . Make sure to check the
latest one(s) whenever you update the imported ` thesist ` version.

==  Usage

If you are in the Typst web app, simply click on âStart from templateâ and
pick this template.

If you want to develop locally:

  1. Make sure you have the *TeX Gyre Heros* font family installed.
  2. Install the package with ` typst init @preview/thesist ` .

==  Overview

*Please read the âQuick guideâ chapter included in this template to get
set up. You can keep it as a reference if you want.*

This templateâs source files, hidden from the user view, are the following:

  - ` layout.typ ` : The main configuration file, which initializes the thesis and contains its general formatting rules.

  - ` figure-numbering.typ ` : This file contains a function to set a chapter-relative numbering for the various types of figures. The function is called once or twice depending on whether the user decides to include appendices.

  - ` utils.typ ` : General functions that you may want to import and use for QoL improvements.

===  A sidenote about subfigures

Since subfigures are not yet native to Typst, the current implementation,
present in ` utils.typ ` , needs the user to manually input whether each
called subfigure figure (aka subfigure grid) is in an appendix or not. This is
because the numbering is different in appendices, and because the
functionality of ` figure-numbering.typ ` canât be applied to subfigure
grids, since they are imported with their default numbering once in every
chapter. ` context ` expressions also donât work across imports, so location
within the document couldnât be used as a parameter (unless the user called
` context ` themselves, which would be unintuitive). *Regardless, the
workaround that was found, which is explained in the quick guide, doesnât
need much thinking from the user, so you can see this as a more technical note
that shouldnât matter when youâre writing the thesis.*

==  Final remarks

This template is not necessarily (or hopefully) a finished product. Feel free
to open issues or pull requests!

Also thanks to the Typst community members for the help in some of the
functionalities, and for the extensions used here.

= *marginalia.md*

=  marginalia

0.1.1

Configurable margin-notes and matching wide blocks.

==  Setup

Put something akin to the following at the start of your ` .typ ` file:



    #import "@preview/marginalia:0.1.1" as marginalia: note, wideblock
    #let config = (
      // inner: ( far: 5mm, width: 15mm, sep: 5mm ),
      // outer: ( far: 5mm, width: 15mm, sep: 5mm ),
      // top: 2.5cm,
      // bottom: 2.5cm,
      // book: false,
      // clearance: 8pt,
      // flush-numbers: false,
      // numbering: /* numbering-function */,
    )
    #marginalia.configure(..config)
    #set page(
      // setup margins:
      ..marginalia.page-setup(..config),
      /* other page setup */
    )


If ` book ` is ` false ` , ` inner ` and ` outer ` correspond to the left and
right margins respectively. If book is true, the margins swap sides on even
and odd pages. Notes are placed in the outside margin by default.

Where you can then customize ` config ` to your preferences. Shown here (as
comments) are the default values taken if the corresponding keys are unset. [
Please refer to the PDF documentation for more details on the configuration
and the provided commands. ](https://github.com/nleanba/typst-
marginalia/blob/v0.1.1/Marginalia.pdf)

==  Margin-Notes

Provided via the ` #note[...] ` command.

  - ` #note(reverse: true)[...] ` to put it on the inside margin.
  - ` #note(numbered: false)[...] ` to remove the marker.

Note: it is recommended to reset the counter for the markers regularly, e.g.
by putting ` marginalia.notecounter.update(0) ` into the code for your header.

==  Wide Blocks

Provided via the ` #wideblock[...] ` command.

  - ` #wideblock(reverse: true)[...] ` to extend into the inside margin instead.
  - ` #wideblock(double: true)[...] ` to extend into both margins.

Note: ` reverse ` and ` double ` are mutually exclusive.

Note: Wideblocks do not handle pagebreaks in ` book: true ` documents well.

==  Figures

You can use figures as normal, also within wideblocks. To get captions on the
side, use



    #set figure(gap: 0pt)
    #set figure.caption(position: top)
    #show figure.caption.where(position: top): note.with(numbered: false, dy: 1em)


For small figures, the package also provides a ` notefigure ` command which
places the figure in the margin.



    #marginalia.notefigure(
      rect(width: 100%),
      label: <aaa>,
      caption: [A notefigure.],
    )

0.2.1

Helpful functions for content positioning and margin comments/notes

Featured  Package

==  Setup

` drafting ` exists in the official typst package repository, so the
recommended approach is to import it from the ` preview ` namespace:



    #import "@preview/drafting:0.2.1"


Margin notes cannot lay themselves out correctly until they know your page
size and margins. By default, they occupy nearly the entirety of the left or
right margin, but you can provide explicit left/right bounds if desired:



    // Example:
    // Default margin in typst is 2.5cm, but we want to use 2cm
    // On the left
    #set-page-properties(margin-left: 2cm)


==  The basics



    #lorem(20)
    #margin-note(side: left)[Hello, world!]
    #lorem(10)
    #margin-note[Hello from the other side]
    #margin-note[When notes are about to overlap, they're automatically shifted]
    #margin-note(stroke: aqua + 3pt)[To avoid collision]
    #lorem(25)
    #margin-note(stroke: green, side: left)[You can provide two positional arguments if you want to highlight a phrase associated with your note.][The first is text which should be inline-noted, and the second is the standard margin note.]

    #let caution-rect = rect.with(inset: 1em, radius: 0.5em, fill: orange.lighten(80%))
    #inline-note(rect: caution-rect)[
      Be aware that `typst` will complain when 4 notes overlap, and stop automatically avoiding collisions when 5 or more notes
      overlap. This is because the compiler stops attempting to reposition notes after a few attempts
      (initial layout + adjustment for each note).

      You can manually adjust the position of notes with `dy` to silence the warning.
    ]


![Example 1](https://www.github.com/ntjess/typst-
drafting/raw/v0.2.1/assets/example-1.png)

==  Adjusting the default style

All function defaults are customizable through updating the module state:



    #lorem(14) #margin-note[Default style]
    #lorem(10)
    #set-margin-note-defaults(stroke: orange, side: left)
    #margin-note[Updated style]
    #lorem(10)


![Example 2](https://www.github.com/ntjess/typst-
drafting/raw/v0.2.1/assets/example-2.png)

Even deeper customization is possible by overriding the default ` rect ` :



    #import "@preview/colorful-boxes:1.1.0": stickybox

    #let default-rect(stroke: none, fill: none, width: 0pt, content) = {
      set text(0.9em)
      stickybox(rotation: 30deg, width: width/1.5, content)
    }
    #set-margin-note-defaults(rect: default-rect, stroke: none, side: right)

    #lorem(20)
    #margin-note(dy: -5em)[Why not use sticky notes in the margin?]

    // Undo changes from this example
    #set-margin-note-defaults(rect: rect, stroke: red)


![Example 3](https://www.github.com/ntjess/typst-
drafting/raw/v0.2.1/assets/example-3.png)

==  Multiple document reviewers



    #let reviewer-a = margin-note.with(stroke: blue)
    #let reviewer-b = margin-note.with(stroke: purple)
    #lorem(10)
    #reviewer-a[Comment from reviewer A]
    #lorem(5)
    #reviewer-b(side: left)[Reviewer B comment]
    #lorem(10)


![Example 4](https://www.github.com/ntjess/typst-
drafting/raw/v0.2.1/assets/example-4.png)

==  Inline Notes



    #lorem(10)
    #inline-note[The default inline note will split the paragraph at its location]
    #lorem(10)
    #inline-note(par-break: false, stroke: (paint: orange, dash: "dashed"))[
      But you can specify `par-break: false` to prevent this
    ]
    #lorem(10)


![Example 5](https://www.github.com/ntjess/typst-
drafting/raw/v0.2.1/assets/example-5.png)

==  Hiding notes for print preview



    #set-margin-note-defaults(hidden: true)

    #lorem(20)
    #margin-note[This will respect the global "hidden" state]
    #margin-note(hidden: false, dy: -2.5em)[This note will never be hidden]
    // Undo these changes
    #set-margin-note-defaults(hidden: false)


![Example 6](https://www.github.com/ntjess/typst-
drafting/raw/v0.2.1/assets/example-6.png)

==  Precise placement: rule grid

Need to measure space for fine-tuned positioning? You can use ` rule-grid ` to
cross-hatch the page with rule lines:



    #rule-grid(width: 10cm, height: 3cm, spacing: 20pt)
    #place(
      dx: 180pt,
      dy: 40pt,
      rect(fill: white, stroke: red, width: 1in, "This will originate at (180pt, 40pt)")
    )

    // Optionally specify divisions of the smallest dimension to automatically calculate
    // spacing
    #rule-grid(dx: 10cm + 3em, width: 3cm, height: 1.2cm, divisions: 5, square: true,  stroke: green)

    // The rule grid doesn't take up space, so add it explicitly
    #v(3cm + 1em)


![Example 7](https://www.github.com/ntjess/typst-
drafting/raw/v0.2.1/assets/example-7.png)

==  Absolute positioning

What about absolutely positioning something regardless of margin and relative
location? ` absolute-place ` is your friend. You can put content anywhere:



    #context {
      let (dx, dy) = (here().position().x, here().position().y)
      let content-str = (
        "This absolutely-placed box will originate at (" + repr(dx) + ", " + repr(dy) + ")"
        + " in page coordinates"
      )
      absolute-place(
        dx: dx, dy: dy,
        rect(
          fill: green.lighten(60%),
          radius: 0.5em,
          width: 2.5in,
          height: 0.5in,
          [#align(center + horizon, content-str)]
        )
      )
    }
    #v(0.5in)


![Example 8](https://www.github.com/ntjess/typst-
drafting/raw/v0.2.1/assets/example-8.png)

The ârule-gridâ also supports absolute placement at the top-left of the
page by passing ` relative: false ` . This is helpful for âruleâ-ing the
whole page.

](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

[ Typst ](https://typst.app/home/) template for presentations built for
simple, efficient use and a clean look using [ touying ](https://touying-
typ.github.io/) . The template provides a custom title page, a footer, a
header, and built-in support for theorem blocks and proofs.

==  Usage

The template is already filled with dummy data, to give users an impression
how it looks like. The paper is obtained by compiling ` main.typ ` .

  - after [ installing Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) you can conveniently use the following to create a new folder containing this project.



    typst init @preview/clean-math-presentation:0.1.0


  - edit the data in ` main.typ ` â ` #show template.with([your data]) `

===  Parameters of the Template

  - ` title ` : Title of the presentation.
  - ` subtitle ` : Subtitle of the presentation, optional.
  - ` short-title ` : Short version of the presentation to be shown in the footer, optional. If not short title is provided, the ` title ` will be shown in the footer.
  - ` date ` : Date of the presentation.
  - ` authors ` : List of names of the authors of the paper. Each entry of the list is a dictionary with the following keys:
    - ` name ` : Name of the author.
    - ` affiliation-id ` : The ID of the affiliation in ` affiliations ` , see below.
  - ` affiliations ` : List of affiliations of the authors. Each entry of the list is a dictionary with the following keys:
    - ` id ` : ID of the affiliation, which is used to link the authors to the affiliation, see above.
    - ` name ` : Name of the affiliation.
  - ` author ` : The name of the presenting author, which will be displayed in the footer of each slide. If the ` author ` matches one of the ` authors ` , this name will be underlined in the title slide.

Other arguments like ` align ` , ` progess-bar ` and more are available and
similar to other templates in touying, especially the [ stargazer theme
](https://touying-typ.github.io/docs/themes/stargazer) . The colorscheme can
be adjusted by passing ` config-colors ` to the ` template ` , e.g.



    config-colors(
      primary: rgb("#6068d6"),
      secondary: rgb("#2f1971"),
    )


The title page can be created with ` #title-slide ` . It accepts optionally a
` background ` , which can be an image or ` none ` (default) and up to two
logos ` logo1 ` and ` logo2 ` ( ` none ` by default).

The theme provides different types of slides like ` #outline-slide ` , `
#focus-slide ` , ` #ending-slide ` , and the usual ` #slide ` .
Additionally,it already provides support for theorems and alike by the
functions ` #theorem ` , ` #lemma ` , ` #corollary ` , ` #definition ` , `
#example ` , and ` #proof ` .

==  Acknowledgements

Some parts of this template are based on the [ stargazer
](https://github.com/touying-typ/touying/blob/main/themes/stargazer.typ) theme
from touying.

==  Feedback & Improvements

If you encounter problems, please open issues. In case you found useful
extensions or improved anything We are also very happy to accept pull
requests.

0.0.1

Sleek, minimalist design for professional business cards. Emphasizing clarity
and elegance.

Featured  Template

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=minimalbc&version=0.0.1)

This repository provides a Typst template for creating sleek and minimalist
professional business cards.

The function, *minimalbc* , allows you to customize the majority of the
business cardâs elements.

By default, the layout is horizontal. However, it can be easily switched to a
vertical layout by passing the value true to the flip argument in the
minimalbc function.

Hereâs an example of how to use the minimalbc function:



    #import "@preview/minimalbc:0.1.0": minimalbc

    #show: minimalbc.with(
        // possible geo_size options: eu, us, jp , cn
        geo_size: "eu",
        flip:true,
        company_name: "company name",
        name: "first and last name",
        role: "role",
        telephone_number: "+000 00 000000",
        email_address: "me@me.com",
        website: "example.com",
        company_logo: image("company_logo.png"),
        bg_color: "ffffff",
    )




When compiled, this example produces a PDF file named âyour filenameâ.pdf
(see example.pdf).

Feel free to download and use this as a starting point for your own business
cards.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=enunciado-facil-fcfm&version=0.1.0)

Template de Typst para documentos de la FCFM (auxiliares, controles, pautas)

==  Ejemplo de uso

===  En [ typst.app ](https://typst.app/)

Si utilizas la aplicaciÃ³n web oficial, puedes presionar âStart from
templateâ y buscar âenunciado-facil-fcfmâ para crear un proyecto ya
inicializado con el template.

===  En CLI

Si usas Typst de manera local, puedes ejecutar:



    typst init @preview/enunciado-facil-fcfm:0.1.0


lo cual inicializarÃ¡ un proyecto usando el template en el directorio actual.

===  Manualmente

Basta crear un archivo con el siguiente contenido para usar el template:



    #import "@preview/enunciado-facil-fcfm:0.1.0" as template

    #show: template.conf.with(
      titulo: "Auxiliar 1",
      subtitulo: "Typst",
      titulo-extra: (
        [*Profesora*: Ada Lovelace],
        [*Auxiliares*: Grace Hopper y Alan Turing],
      ),
      departamento: template.departamentos.dcc,
      curso: "CC4034 - ComposiciÃ³n de documentos",
    )

    ...el resto del documento comienza acÃ¡


Puedes ver un ejemplo mÃ¡s completo en [ main.typ
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/enunciado-facil-
fcfm/0.1.0/template/main.typ) . Para aprender la sintÃ¡xis de Typst existe la
[ documentaciÃ³n oficial ](https://typst.app/docs) . Si vienes desde LaTeX, te
recomiendo la [ guÃ­a para usuarios de LaTeX
](https://typst.app/docs/guides/guide-for-latex-users/) .

==  ConfiguraciÃ³n

La funciÃ³n ` conf ` importada desde el template recibe los siguientes
parÃ¡metros:

ParÃ¡metro  |  DescripciÃ³n
---|---
` titulo ` |  TÃ­tulo del documento
` subtitulo ` |  SubtÃ­tulo del documento
` titulo-extra ` |  Arreglo con bloques de contenido adicionales a agregar despuÃ©s del tÃ­tulo. Ãtil para mostrar los nombres del equipo docente.
` departamento ` |  Diccionario que contiene el nombre ( ` string ` ) y el logo del departamento ( ` content ` ). El template viene con uno ya creado para cada departamento bajo ` template.departamentos ` . Valor por defecto: ` template.departamentos.dcc `
` curso ` |  CÃ³digo y/o nombre del curso.
` page-conf ` |  Diccionario con parÃ¡metros adicionales (tamaÃ±o de pÃ¡gina, mÃ¡rgenes, etc) para pasarle a la funciÃ³n [ page ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/) .

==  FAQ

===  CÃ³mo cambiar el logo del departamento

El parÃ¡metro ` departamento ` solamente es un diccionario de Typst con las
llaves ` nombre ` y ` logo ` . Puedes crear un diccionario con un logo
personalizado y pasÃ¡rselo al template:



    #import "@preview/enunciado-facil-fcfm:0.1.0" as template

    #let mi-departamento = (
      nombre: "Mi sÃºper departamento personalizado",
      logo: image("mi-super-logo.png"),
    )

    #show: template.conf.with(
      titulo: "Documento con logo personalizado",
      departamento: mi-departamento,
      curso: "CC4034 - ComposiciÃ³n de documentos",
    )


===  CÃ³mo cambiar mÃ¡rgenes, tamaÃ±o de pÃ¡gina, etcÃ©tera

Para cambiar la configuraciÃ³n de la pÃ¡gina hay que interceptar la [ set rule
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/styling/#set-rules) que se hace sobre `
page ` . Para ello, el template expone el parÃ¡metro ` page-conf ` que permit
sobreescribir la configuraciÃ³n de pÃ¡gina del template. Por ejemplo, para
cambiar el tamaÃ±o del papel a A4:



    #import "@preview/enunciado-facil-fcfm:0.1.0" as template

    #show: template.conf.with(
      titulo: "Documento con tamaÃ±o A4",
      departamento: template.departamentos.dcc,
      curso: "CC4034 - ComposiciÃ³n de documentos",
      page-conf: (paper: "a4")
    )


===  CÃ³mo cambiar la fuente, headings, etc

Usando [ show y set rules ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/styling/) puedes
personalizar mucho mÃ¡s el template. Por ejemplo, para cambiar la fuente:



    #import "@preview/enunciado-facil-fcfm:0.1.0" as template

    // En este caso hay que cambiar la fuente
    // antes de que se configure el template
    // para que se aplique en el tÃ­tulo y encabezado
    #set text(font: "New Computer Modern")

    #show: template.conf.with(
      titulo: "Documento con la fuente de LaTeX",
      departamento: template.departamentos.dcc,
      curso: "CC4034 - ComposiciÃ³n de documentos",
    )

= *unequivocal-ams.md*

![A preview of the unequivocal-ams Typst
template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/unequivocal-
ams-0.1.2-small.webp)

=  unequivocal-ams

0.1.2

An AMS-style paper template to publish at conferences and journals for
mathematicians

Featured  Template

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=unequivocal-ams&version=0.1.2)

A single-column paper for the American Mathematical Society. The template
comes with functions for theorems and proofs. It also is a nice starting point
for a classy tech report or thesis.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` unequivocal-ams ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/unequivocal-ams


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` ams-article ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` authors ` : An array of author dictionaries. Each of the author dictionaries must have a ` name ` key and can have the keys ` department ` , ` organization ` , ` location ` , and ` email ` . All keys accept content.
  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or ` none ` . Appears at the top of the first column in boldface.
  - ` paper-size ` : Defaults to ` us-letter ` . Specify a [ paper size string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-paper) to change the page format.
  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the ` bibliography ` function or ` none ` . Specifying this will configure numeric, Springer MathPhys-style citations.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
paper.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` ams-
article ` function in a show rule. If you, however, want to change an existing
project to use this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of
your file:



    #import "@preview/unequivocal-ams:0.1.2": ams-article, theorem, proof

    #show: ams-article.with(
      title: [Mathematical Theorems],
      authors: (
        (
          name: "Ralph Howard",
          department: [Department of Mathematics],
          organization: [University of South Carolina],
          location: [Columbia, SC 29208],
          email: "howard@math.sc.edu",
          url: "www.math.sc.edu/~howard"
        ),
      ),
      abstract: lorem(100),
      bibliography: bibliography("refs.bib"),
    )

0.1.2

A memo template inspired by the design of Edward Tufte's books

Featured  Template

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=tufte-memo&version=0.1.2)

A memo document template inspired by the design of Edward Tufteâs books for
the Typst typesetting program.

For usage, see the usage guide [ here ](https://github.com/nogula/tufte-
memo/blob/main/template/main.pdf) .

The template provides handy functions: ` template ` , ` note ` , and `
wideblock ` . To create a document with this template, use:



    #import "@preview/tufte-memo:0.1.2": *

    #show: template.with(
        title: [Document Title],
        authors: (
            (
            name: "Author Name",
            role: "Optional Role Line",
            affiliation: "Optional Affiliation Line",
            email: "email@company.com"
            ),
        )
    )
    ...


additional configuration information is available in the usage guide.

The ` note() ` function provides the ability to produce sidenotes next to the
main body content. It can be called simply with ` #note[...] ` . Additionally,
` wideblock() ` expands the width of its content to fill the full 6.5-inch-
wide space, rather than be compressed in to a four-inch column. It is simply
called with ` wideblock[...] ` .

=  algorithmic

0.1.0

Algorithm pseudocode typesetting for Typst, inspired by algorithmicx in LaTeX

This is a package inspired by the LaTeX [ ` algorithmicx `
](https://ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx) package for Typst. Itâs useful for
writing pseudocode and typesetting it all nicely.

![screenshot of the typst-algorithmic output, showing line numbers, automatic

indentation, bolded keywords, and
such](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/algorithmic/0.1.0/docs/assets/demo-
rendered.png)

Example:



    #import "@preview/algorithmic:0.1.0"
    #import algorithmic: algorithm

    #algorithm({
      import algorithmic: *
      Function("Binary-Search", args: ("A", "n", "v"), {
        Cmt[Initialize the search range]
        Assign[$l$][$1$]
        Assign[$r$][$n$]
        State[]
        While(cond: $l <= r$, {
          Assign([mid], FnI[floor][$(l + r)/2$])
          If(cond: $A ["mid"] < v$, {
            Assign[$l$][$m + 1$]
          })
          ElsIf(cond: [$A ["mid"] > v$], {
            Assign[$r$][$m - 1$]
          })
          Else({
            Return[$m$]
          })
        })
        Return[*null*]
      })
    })


This DSL is implemented using the same trick as [ CeTZ
](https://github.com/johannes-wolf/typst-canvas) uses: a code block of arrays
gets those arrays joined together.

Currently this library is not really customizable. Please vendor it and hack
it up as needed then file an issue for the customization option youâre
missing.

==  Reference

====  stmt

Statement-level contexts in ` algorithmic ` generally accept the type ` body `
in the following:



    body = (ast|content)[] | ast | content
    ast = (change_indent: int, body: body)


====  inline

Inline functions will generate plain content.

====  ` algorithmic(..bits) `

Takes one or more lists of ` ast ` and creates an algorithmic block with line
numbers.

===  Control flow

====  ` Function ` / ` Procedure ` (stmt)

Defined as ` f(name: string|content, args: content[]?, ..body) ` . Body can be
one or more ` body ` values.

====  ` If ` / ` ElseIf ` / ` Else ` / ` For ` / ` While ` (stmt)

Defined as ` f(cond: string|content, ..body) ` . Body can be one or more `
body ` values.

Generates an indented block with the body, and the specified ` cond ` between
the two keywords as condition.

===  Statements

====  ` Assign ` (stmt)

Defined as ` Assign(var: content, val: content) ` .

Generates ` #var <- #val ` .

====  ` CallI ` (inline), ` Call ` (stmt)

Defined as ` f(name, args: content|content[]) ` .

Calls a function with the function name styled in smallcaps and the args
joined by commas.

====  ` Cmt ` (stmt)

Defined as ` Cmt(body: content) ` .

Makes a line comment.

====  ` FnI ` (inline), ` Fn ` (stmt)

Defined as ` f(name, args: content|content[]) ` .

Calls a function with the function name styled in bold and the args joined by
commas.

====  ` Ic ` (inline)

Defined as ` Ic(body: content) -> content ` .

Makes an inline comment.

====  ` Return ` (stmt)

Defined as ` Return(arg: content) ` .

Generates ` return #arg ` .

====  ` State ` (stmt)

Defined as ` State(body: content) ` .

Turns any content into a line.

![thumbnail](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/silky-
report-insa/0.4.0/thumbnail-insa-stage.png)

If you want to make an internship report, you will need to use another show
rule: ` insa-stage ` .

====  Example



    #import "@preview/silky-report-insa:0.4.0": *
    #show: doc => insa-stage(
      "Youenn LE JEUNE",
      "INFO",
      "2023-2024",

    Bleble

    #pagebreak()
    = Conclusion
    Conclusion random

    #pagebreak()

===  ðï¸ Blank templates

![thumbnail](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/silky-
report-insa/0.4.0/thumbnail-insa-document.png)

If you do not want the preformatted output with âTP xâ, the title and date
in the header, etc. you can simply use the ` insa-document ` show rule and
customize all by yourself.

====  Blank template types

The graphic charter provides 3 different document types, that are translated
in this Typst template under those names:

  - *` light ` * , which does not have many color and can be printed easily. Has 3 spots to write on the cover: ` cover-top-left ` , ` cover-middle-left ` and ` cover-bottom-right ` .
  - *` colored ` * , which is beautiful but consumes a lot of ink to print. Only has 1 spot to write on the cover: ` cover-top-left ` .
  - *` pfe ` * , which is primarily used for internship reports. Has 4 spots to write on both the front and back covers: ` cover-top-left ` , ` cover-middle-left ` , ` cover-bottom-right ` and ` back-cover ` .

The document type must be the first argument of the ` insa-document `
function.

====  Example



    #import "@preview/silky-report-insa:0.4.0": *
    #show: doc => insa-document(
      "light",
      cover-top-left: [*Document important*],
      cover-middle-left: [
        NOM PrÃ©nom

        DÃ©partement INFO
      ],
      cover-bottom-right: "uwu",
      page-header: "En-tÃªte au pif",
      doc
    )


====  Parameters

*Parameter* |  Type  |  Description
---|---|---
*cover-type* |  str  |  ( *REQUIRED* ) Type of cover. Available are: light, colored, pfe.
*cover-top-left* |  content  |
*cover-middle-left* |  content  |
*cover-bottom-right* |  content  |
*back-cover* |  content  |  What to display on the back cover.
*page-header* |  content  |  Header of the pages (except the front and back). If ` none ` , will display the INSA logo. If not empty, will display the passed content with an underline.
*page-footer* |  content  |  Footer of the pages (except the front and back). The page counter will be displayed at the right of the footer, except if the page number is 0.
*include-back-cover* |  bool  |  whether to add the back cover or not.
*insa* |  str  |  INSA name ( ` rennes ` , ` hdf ` â¦)
*lang* |  str  |  Language of the template. Some strings are translated.
*metadata-title* |  content  |  Title of the document that will be embedded in the PDF metadata.
*metadata-authors* |  str list  |  Authors that will be embedded in the PDF metadata.
*metadata-date* |  datetime  |  Date that will be set as the document creation date. If not specified, will be set to now.

==  Fonts

The graphic charter recommends the fonts *League Spartan* for headings and
*Source Serif* for regular text. To have the best look, you should install
those fonts.

> You can download the fonts from [ here ](https://github.com/SkytAsul/INSA-
> Typst-Template/tree/main/fonts) .

To behave correctly on computers lacking those specific fonts, this template
will automatically fallback to similar ones:

  - *League Spartan* -> *Arial* (approved by INSAâs graphic charter, by default in Windows) -> *Liberation Sans* (by default in most Linux)
  - *Source Serif* -> *Source Serif 4* (downloadable for free) -> *Georgia* (approved by the graphic charter) -> *Linux Libertine* (default Typst font)

===  Note on variable fonts

If you want to install those fonts on your computer, Typst might not recognize
them if you install their _Variable_ versions. You should install the static
versions ( *League Spartan Bold* and most versions of *Source Serif* ).

Keep an eye on [ the issue in Typst bug tracker
](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/185) to see when variable fonts will
be used!

==  Notes

This template is being developed by Youenn LE JEUNE from the INSA de Rennes in
[ this repository ](https://github.com/SkytAsul/INSA-Typst-Template) .

For now it includes assets from the graphic charters of those INSAs:

  - Rennes ( ` rennes ` )
  - Hauts de France ( ` hdf ` )
  - Centre Val de Loire ( ` cvl ` ) Users from other INSAs can open a pull request on the repository with the assets for their INSA.

If you have any other feature request, open an issue on the repository.

==  License

The typst template is licensed under the [ MIT license
](https://github.com/SkytAsul/INSA-Typst-Template/blob/main/LICENSE) . This
does _not_ apply to the image assets. Those image files are property of Groupe
INSA.

0.1.2

A template for a thesis at EPFL

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=scholarly-epfl-thesis&version=0.1.2)

Port of [ an unofficial LaTeX template
](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/swiss-federal-institute-of-
technology-in-lausanne-epfl-phd-thesis/dhcgtppybcwv) to Typst.

A complete example is shown in the [ example folder
](https://github.com/augustebaum/epfl-thesis-typst/blob/v0.1.2/example) ; see
[ example.pdf ](https://github.com/augustebaum/epfl-thesis-
typst/blob/v0.1.2/example/main.pdf) for the rendered PDF. The document
structure can of course be adapted to your needs.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` epfl ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/scholarly-epfl-thesis


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

This template uses certain fonts, including Utopia Latex for most text. If the
font is not available to Typst, as is the case in the Typst Web App, then the
template will fall back to a default font. The font is included in example
shown in the Github repository [ here ](https://github.com/augustebaum/epfl-
thesis-typst/blob/v0.1.2/example/utopia_font) , otherwise you can download it
however you like.

===  Configuration

This template exports the ` template ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` title ` : The workâs title. Default: ` [Your Title] `
  - ` author ` : The authorâs name. Default: ` "Your Name" `
  - ` paper-size ` : The workâs [ paper size ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page#parameters-paper) . Default: ` "a4" `
  - ` date ` : The workâs date. Unused for now. Default: ` none `
  - ` date-format ` : The format for displaying the workâs date. By default, the date will be displayed as ` MMMM DD, YYYY ` . Unused for now. Default: ` [month repr:long] [day padding:zero], [year repr:full] `

The template will initialize your package with a basic call to the ` template
` function in a ` show ` rule. If you, however, want to change an existing
project to use this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of
your file:



    #import "@preview/scholarly-epfl-thesis:0.1.2": *

    #show: template.with(
      title: [Your Title],
      author: "Your Name",
      date: datetime(year: 2024, month: 03, day: 19),
    )

    // Your content goes below.


Also included are the ` front-matter ` , ` main-matter ` and ` back-matter `
helpers which you can use in ` show ` rules in your document to change certain
settings when they are called: e.g. reset the page numbering when main matter
starts, or number headings with letters in the back matter. See [
example/main.typ ](https://github.com/augustebaum/epfl-thesis-
typst/blob/v0.1.2/example/main.typ) for example usage.

==  Development

In order for Typst to access the Utopia Latex font, you need to include it
your font path. Iâve included the font in ` example/ ` so that you can run
this in your shell:



    cd example
    typst w main.typ --font-path .


See [ here ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-font) for
more about the font path.

= *tutor.md*

=  tutor

0.7.0

Utilities to create exams.

Utilities to write exams and exercises with integrated solutions. Set the
variable ` #(cfg.sol = true) ` to display the solutions of a document.

Currently the following features are supported:

  - Automatic total point calculation through the ` #points() ` and ` #totalpoints() ` functions.
  - Checkboxes that are either blank or show the solution state using eg. ` #checkbox(cfg, true) ` .
  - Display blank lines allowing students to write their answer using eg. ` #lines(cfg, 3) ` .
  - A proposition for a project structure allowing self-contained exercises and a mechanism to show or hide the solutions of an exercise.

==  Usage

===  Minimal Example



    #import "@local/tutor:0.6.1": points, totalpoints, lines, checkbox, default-config

    #let cfg = default-config()
    // enable solution mode
    #(cfg.sol = true)

    // display 3 lines (for hand written answer)
    #lines(cfg, 3)
    // checkbox for multiple choice (indicates correct state)
    #checkbox(cfg, true)

    // show achievable points
    Max. points: #points(2)
    Max. points: #points(3)
    // show sum of all total achievable points (will show 5)
    Total points: #totalpoints(cfg)


===  Practical Example

Check [ example ](https://github.com/rangerjo/tutor/tree/main/example) for a
more practical example.

` tutor ` is best used with the following directory and file structure:



    âââ main.typ
    âââ src
    â   âââ ex1
    â   â   âââ ex.typ
    â   âââ ex2
    â       âââ ex.typ
    âââ tutor.toml


Every directory in ` src ` holds one self-contained exercise. The exercises
can be imported into ` main.typ ` :



    #import "@local/tutor:0.6.1": totalpoints, lines, default-config

    #import "src/ex1/ex.typ" as ex1
    #import "src/ex2/ex.typ" as ex2


    #let cfg = default-config()
    #ex1.exercise(cfg)
    #ex2.exercise(cfg)


Supporting self-contained exercises is one of ` tutor ` s primary design
goals. Each exercise lives within a folder and can easily be copied or
referenced in a new document.

An exercise is a folder that contains an ` ex.typ ` file along with any other
assets (images, source code aso). The following exercise shows a practical
usage of the ` #checkbox() ` and ` #points() ` functions.

` src/ex1/ex.typ `



    #import "@local/tutor:0.6.1": points, checkbox

    #let exercise(cfg) = [
    #heading(level:cfg.lvl, [Abbreviation FHIR (#points(1) point)])

    What does FHIR stand for?

    #set list(marker: none)
    - #checkbox(cfg, false)  Finally He Is Real
    - #checkbox(cfg, true)   Fast Health Interoperability Resources
    - #checkbox(cfg, false)   First Health Inactivation Restriction

    #if cfg.sol {
      [ Further explanation: FHIR is the new standard developed by HL7. ]
    }
    ]


Finally this second example shows the ` #lines() ` function. ` src/ex2/ex.typ
`



    #import "@local/tutor:0.6.1": points, lines

    #let exercise(cfg) = [
    #heading(level:cfg.lvl, [FHIR vs HL7v2 (#points(4.5) points)])

    List two differences between HL7v2 and FHIR:

    + #if cfg.sol { [ HL7v2 uses a non-standard line format, where as FHIR uses XML or JSON] } else { [ #lines(cfg, 3) ] }
    + #if cfg.sol { [ FHIR specifies various resources that can be queried, where as HL7v2 has a number of fixed fields that are either filled in or not]} else { [ #lines(cfg, 3) ] }
    ]


This would then give the following output in question mode ( `
#(cfg.sol=false) ` ) and in solution mode ( ` #(cfg.sol=true) ` ): ![Example
document in solution
mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rangerjo/tutor/main/imgs/example_mod.png)

==  Utilities

===  lines

` #lines(cfg, count) ` prints ` count ` lines for students to write their
answer.

Configuration:



    // Vertical line spacing between rows.
    #(cfg.utils.lines.spacing = 8mm)


===  grid

` #grid(cfg, width, height) ` prints a grid for students to write their
answer.

Configuration:



    // Grid spacing.
    #(cfg.utils.grid.spacing = 4mm)


===  checkbox

` #checkbox(cfg, answer) ` shows a checkbox. In solution mode, the checkbox is
shown filled out.

Configuration:



    // Symbol to show if answer is true
    #(cfg.utils.checkbox.sym_true = "â")
    // Symbol to show if answer is false
    #(cfg.utils.checkbox.sym_false = "â")
    // Symbol to show in question mode
    #(cfg.utils.checkbox.sym_question = "â")


===  points

` #points(cfg, num) ` displays the given ` num ` while adding its value to the
total points counter.

Configuration: none

===  totalpoints

` #totalpoints(cfg) ` shows the final value of the total points counter.

Configuration:



    // If points() is used in the outline, totalpoints value becomes doubled.
    // By setting outline to true, totalpoints gets divided by half.
    #(cfg.utils.totalpoints.outline = false)


==  Modes

` tutor ` comes with a solution and a test mode.

===  solution mode

Solution mode controls wheter solutions are shown or not. This mode controls
eg. the utility ` #checkbox(cfg, answer) ` .

  1. ` (cfg.sol = false) ` : Solutions are hidden. This is used for the actual exam handed out to students.
  2. ` (cfg.sol = true) ` : Solutions are shown. This is used to create the exam solutions.

You can also use the following helper functions:

  - ` if-sol(cfg,[Content only shown in solution mode.]) `
  - ` if-sol-else(cfg,[Content only shown in solution mode.], [Content only shown in exam mode.]) `

===  test mode

Test mode can be used to show or hide additional information. In test mode,
one might want

  1. ` (cfg.test = true) ` : Test information are shown. Use this eg. to display ` #points(4) ` . This is used in case the document is used as an exam/test.

  2. ` (cfg.test = false) ` : Test information are hidden. This is used in case the document is used as an excerise.

The following would show the points only in test mode.



    #if cfg.test {
      #points(4)
    }


Or you can use the following helper functions:

  - ` if-test(cfg,[Content only shown in test mode.]) `
  - ` if-test-else(cfg,[Content only shown in test mode.], [Content only shown in exercise mode.]) `

==  Configuration

` tutor ` is designed to create exams and solutions with one single document
source. Furthermore, the individual utilities provided by ` tutor ` can be
configured. This can be done in one of three ways:

  1. Use the ` #default-config() ` function and patch your configuration. The following example would configure the solution mode and basic line spacings to 8 millimeters:



    #let cfg = default-config()
    #(cfg.sol = false)
    #(cfg.utils.lines.spacing = 8mm)


  2. Use an external file to hold the configurations in your prefered format. See [ tutor.toml ](https://github.com/rangerjo/tutor/blob/main/example/tutor.toml) for a configuration in TOML. Load the configuration into your main document using



    #let cfg = toml("tutor.toml")


  3. Use typstâs input feature added with compiler version 0.11.0. Add the following snippet to load the configuration, then overwrite it from the CLI like this: ` typst compile --input tutor_sol=true main.typ `



    #let cfg = toml("tutor.toml")

    #if sys.inputs.tutor_sol == "true" {
      (cfg.sol = true)
    } else if sys.inputs.tutor_sol == "false" {
      (cfg.sol = false)
    }


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` tutor `



    #import "@preview/tutor:0.7.0"

= *codedis.md*

=  codedis

0.1.0

A simple package for displaying code.

Used to display code files in Typst. Main feature is that it displays code
blocks over multiple pages in a way that implies the code block continues onto
the next page. Also a simple and intuitive syntax for displaying code blocks.

Usage:



    // IMPORT PACKAGE
    #import "@preview/codedis:0.1.0": code

    // READ IN CODE
    #let codeblock-1 = read("some_code.py")
    #let codeblock-2 = read("some_code.cpp")

    #set page(numbering: "1")
    #v(80%)

    // DEFAULT LANGUAGE IS Python ("py")
    #code(codeblock-1)
    #code(codeblock-2, lang: "cpp")


Renders to:
![image](https://github.com/AugustinWinther/codedis/assets/30674646/76bb13d5-adc8-457f-bd55-53e3fd5c5df7)

It is very basic and limited, but it does what I need it too, and hope that it
may be of help to others. Iâm most likely not going to develop it further
than this.

==  Introduction

With *pillar* , you can significantly simplify the column setup of tables by
unifying the specification of the number, alignment, and separation of
columns. This package is in particular designed for scientific tables, which
typically have simple styling:

![Table of some piano notes and their names and
frequencies](https://github.com/user-
attachments/assets/c0c60651-c682-4968-9ac9-0fa1e8d85dad)

In order to prepare this table with just the built-in methods, some code like
the following would be required.



    #table(
      columns: 5,
      align: (center,) * 4 + (right,),
      stroke: none,


      [Piano Key], table.vline(), [MIDI Number], [Note Name], [Pitch Name], table.vline(), [$f$ in Hz],
      ..
    )


Using *pillar* , the same can be achieved with



    #table(
        ..pillar.cols("c|ccc|r"),

        [Piano Key], [MIDI Number], [Note Name], [Pitch Name], [$f$ in Hz], ..
    )


or alternatively



    #pillar.table(
        cols: "c|ccc|r",

        [Piano Key], [MIDI Number], [Note Name], [Pitch Name], [$f$ in Hz], ..
    )


*Pillar* is designed for interoperability. It uses the powerful standard
tables and provides generated arguments for ` table ` âs ` columns ` , `
align ` , ` stroke ` , and for the specified vertical lines. This means that
all features of the built-in tables (and also ` show ` and ` set ` rules) can
be applied as usual.

==  Column specification

This package works with _column specification strings_ . Each column is
described by its alignment which can be ` l ` (left), ` c ` (center), ` r `
(right), or ` a ` (auto).

The width of a column can optionally be specified by appending a (relative)
length, or fraction in square brackets to the alignment specifier, e.g., `
c[2cm] ` or ` r[1fr] ` .

Vertical lines can be added between columns with a ` | ` character. Double lines can be produced with ` || ` (see [ ` vline ` customization ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pillar/0.2.0/#vline-customization) ). The stroke of the vertical line can be changed by appending anything that is usually allowed as a stroke argument in square brackets, e.g., ` |[2pt] ` , ` |[red] ` or ` |[(dash: \"dashed\")] ` .

A column specification string may contain any number of spaces (e.g., to
improve readability) â all spaces will be ignored.

_If you find yourself writing highly complex column specifications, consider
not using this package and resort to the parameters that the built-in tables
provide. This package is intended for quick and relatively simple column
specifications._

==  Number alignment

Choosing capital letters ` L ` , ` C ` , ` R ` , or ` A ` instead of lower-
case letters activates number alignment at the decimal separator for a
specific column (similar to the column type âSâ of the LaTeX package [
siunitx ](https://github.com/josephwright/siunitx) ). This feature is provided
via the Typst package *Zero* . [ Here ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/zero) you
can read up on the configuration of number formatting.



    #let percm = $"cm"^(-1)$

    #pillar.table(
      cols: "l|CCCC",
      [], [$Î Î½_0$ in #percm], [$B'_Î½$ in #percm], [$B''_Î½$ in #percm], [$D'_Î½$ in #percm],
      table.hline(),
      [Measurement], [14525.278],   [1.41],    [1.47],    [1.5e-5],
      [Uncertainty], [2],           [0.3],     [0.3],     [4e-6],
      [Ref. [2]],    [14525,74856], [1.37316], [1.43777], [5.401e-6]
    )


![Number alignment](https://github.com/user-
attachments/assets/066cd34e-7043-48c7-b067-e3256e942f14)

Non-number entries (e.g., in the header) are automatically recognized in some
cases and will not be aligned. In ambiguous cases, adding a leading or
trailing space tells Zero not to apply alignment to this cell, e.g., `
[Voltage ] ` instead of ` [Voltage] ` .

==  ` pillar.cols() `

This function produces an argument list that may contain arguments for `
columns ` , ` align ` , ` stroke ` , and ` column-gutter ` as well as
instances of ` table.vline() ` . These arguments are intended to be expanded
with the ` .. ` syntax into the argument list of ` table ` as shown in the
examples.

==  ` pillar.table() `

This is a thin wrapper that behaves just like the built-in ` table ` , except
that it extracts the first positional argument if it is a string, and runs it
through ` pillar.cols() ` .

==  ` vline ` customization

In order to customize the default line setting, just use set rules on `
table.vline ` , e.g.,



    #set table.vline(stroke: .7pt)

    #table(..pillar.cols("c|cc"), ..)


Double lines are currently experimental and are realized through column
gutters. They could also be realized through patterns, but this can produce
artifacts with some renderers. As it currently is, double lines are not
supported before the first and after the last column. On the other hand, with
the current method, double lines are styled with set rules on ` table.vline `
which is nice and not achievable in the same way with patterns.

==  Examples

===  Double lines

The following example uses a double line for visually separating repeated
table columns.



    #pillar.table(
      cols: "ccc ||[.7pt] ccc",

      ..([\#], [$Î±$ in Â°], [$Î²$ in Â°]) * 2,
      table.hline(),
      [1], [34.3], [11.1],  [6], [34.0], [12.9],
      [2], [34.2], [11.2],  [7], [34.3], [12.8],
      [3], [34.6], [11.4],  [8], [33.9], [11.9],
      [4], [34.7], [10.3],  [9], [34.4], [11.8],
      [5], [34.3], [11.1], [10], [34.4], [11.8],
    )

0.1.3

Create simple static slides using standard headings

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=slydst&version=0.1.3)

Create simple static slides with Typst.

Slydst allows the creation of slides using Typst headings. This simplicity
comes at the expense of dynamic content such as subslide animations. For more
complete and complex slides functionalities, see other tools such as Polylux.

See the [ preview
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/slydst/0.1.3/#example)
below.

==  Usage

To start, just use the following preamble (only the title is required).



    #import "@preview/slydst:0.1.3": *

    #show: slides.with(
      title: "Slydst: Slides with Typst",
      subtitle: none,
      date: none,
      authors: ("Gaspard Lambrechts",),
      layout: "medium",
      ratio: 4/3,
      title-color: none,
    )

    Insert your content here.


Then, insert your content.

  - *Level-one headings* corresponds to new sections.
  - *Level-two headings* corresponds to new slides.
  - Blank space can be filled with *vertical spaces* like ` #v(1fr) ` .



    == Outline

    #outline()

    = First section

    == First slide

    #figure(image("figure.png", width: 60%), caption: "Caption")

    #v(1fr)

    #lorem(20)


==  Title page

Alternatively, you can omit the title argument and write your own title page.
Note that the subtitle, date and authors arguments be ignored in that case.



    #show: slides.with(
      layout: "medium",
    )

    #align(center + horizon)[
      #text(2em, default-color)[_Slydst: Slides in Typst_]
    ]

    Insert your content here.


We advise the use of the ` title-slide ` function that ensures a proper
centering and no page numbering.



    #show: slides

    #title-slide(layout: "medium")[
      #text(2em, default-color)[_Slydst: Slides in Typst_]
    ]

    Insert your content here.


==  Components

Definitions, theorems, lemmas, corollaries and algorithms boxes are also
available.



    #definition(title: "An interesting definition")[
      #lorem(20)
    ]


==  Documentation

===  ` slides `

  - ` content ` : ` content ` \- content of the presentation
  - ` title ` : ` str ` \- title (required)
  - ` subtitle ` : ` str ` \- subtitle
  - ` date ` : ` str ` \- date
  - ` authors ` : ` array ` of ` content ` or ` content ` \- list of authors or author content
  - ` layout ` : ` str in ("small", "medium", "large") ` \- layout selection
  - ` ratio ` : ` float ` or ` ratio ` or ` int ` \- width to height ratio
  - ` title-color ` : ` color ` or ` gradient ` \- color of title and headings

===  ` title-slide `

  - ` content ` : ` content ` \- content of the slide

===  ` definition ` , ` theorem ` , ` lemma ` , ` corollary ` , ` algorithm `

  - ` content ` : ` content ` \- content of the block
  - ` title ` : ` str ` \- title of the block
  - ` fill-header ` : ` color ` \- color of the header (inferred if only ` fill-body ` is specified)
  - ` fill-body ` : ` color ` \- color of the body (inferred if only ` fill-header ` is specified)
  - ` radius ` : ` length ` \- radius of the corners of the block

0.1.0

A clean and minimal food menu template

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=caidan&version=0.1.0)

Caidan (èå in Chinese, /cÃ i dÄn/, meaning food menu) is a clean and
minimal food menu template.

See the [ example.pdf
](https://github.com/cu1ch3n/caidan/blob/main/example.pdf) file to see how it
looks. Additionally, [ cu1ch3n/menu ](https://github.com/cu1ch3n/menu) serves
as a practical example project utilizing this template.

==  Usage

Ensure that [ WebOMints GD
](http://www.galapagosdesign.com/original/webomints.htm) , [ LXGW WenKai
](https://github.com/lxgw/LxgwWenKai) , and [ Ysabeau Infant
](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ysabeau+Infant) fonts are installed first.
The required fonts are provided in [ fonts
](https://github.com/cu1ch3n/caidan/tree/main/fonts) .

To use this template with typst.app, you may upload the required fonts
manually ( *Note* : [ LXGW WenKai ](https://github.com/lxgw/LxgwWenKai) may
be too large to upload onto typst.app).

==  Configuration

This template includes the ` caidan ` function, which comes with several
configurable named arguments:

Argument  |  Default Value  |  Type  |  Description
---|---|---|---
` title ` |  ` none ` |  [ content ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) |  The title for your menu
` cover_image ` |  ` none ` |  [ content ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) |  The image on the menuâs cover page
` update_date ` |  ` none ` |  [ datetime ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/datetime/) |  This date will be displayed on the cover page in both Chinese and English
` page_height ` |  ` 595.28pt ` |  [ length ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/length/) |  Page height of your menu
` page_width ` |  ` 841.89pt ` |  [ length ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/length/) |  Page width of your menu
` num_columns ` |  ` 3 ` |  [ int ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/int/) |  The number of columns per page

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body.

==  Example

    #todo(position: right)[Also right]

    // You can add arbitrary content
    #todo[We need to fix the $lim_(x -> oo)$ equation. See #link("https://example.com")[example.com]]

    // And you can create an outline for the TODOs
    #outline(title: "TODOs", target: figure.where(kind: "todo"))


==  Styling

You can modify the text by wrapping it, e.g.:



    #let small-todo = (..args) => text(size: 0.6em)[#todo(..args)]

    #small-todo[This will be in fine print]

0.1.0

A package for creating O'Rly- / O'Reilly-type cover pages

[ ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dei-layborer/o-rly-
typst/refs/heads/main/made-
with-\(2s\)-2%2C6-diamino-n-%5B\(2s\)-1-phenylpropan-2-yl%5Dhexanamide-n-%5B\(2s\)-1-phenyl-2-propanyl%5D-l-
lysinamide.svg) ](https://forthebadge.com/)

[ ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dei-layborer/o-rly-
typst/refs/heads/main/%24%24%24-gimmie.svg)
](https://deilayborer.neocities.org/funding)

A ` typst ` package for creating *OâRLY?* -style cover pages.

==  Example



    #import "@preview/o-rly-cover:0.1.0": *

    #orly(
        color: rgb("#85144b"),
        title: "Learn to Stop Worrying and Love Metathesis",
        top-text: "Axe nat why (or do)",
        subtitle: "Free yourself from prescriptivism",
        pic: "chomskydoz.png",
        signature: "Dr. N. Supponent"
    )


![example book
cover](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/fauxreilly/0.1.0/example.png)

==  Usage

First, import the package at the top of your ` typst ` file: ` #import
"@preview/o-rly-cover:0.1.0": * `

Only one function is exposed, ` #orly() ` . This will create its own page in
the document at whatever location you call the function. In other words, any
content in the ` typst ` document that appears before ` #orly() ` is called
will be before the OâRly? page in the PDF that ` typst ` renders. Anything
after the function call will be on subsequent page(s).

All content for the title page is passed as options to ` #orly() ` . I
included what I figured were the most likely things youâd want to customize
without having a million options. Meanwhile, most of the layout parameters
(font sizes, the heights of individual pieces, etc.) are variables within the
code, so hopefully arenât too hard to alter if need-be. None of the options
are strictly required, although the text fields are the only ones that can be
left empty without potentially breaking the layout. A few have defaults
instead, and those are listed below where applicable.

===  Options

The order that the options appear in the table is the order they must be sent
to the function, unless you specify the optionâs key along with its value.

Data types listed are based on ` typst ` âs internal types, so are entered
the same way as they would be in any other function that takes that data type.
For example, the data type needed for the ` font ` option is the same as what
is used for ` typst ` âs built-in ` #text() ` function, which is linked in
the table below. (All links go to their specific usage in the ` typst `
documentation.)

Option  |  Description  |  Type  |  Default
---|---|---|---
` font ` |  The font for all text except the âpublisherâ in the bottom-left corner  |  [ ` string(s) ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-font) |  Whatever is set in the document context
` color ` |  Accent color. Used for the background of the title block and of the colored bar at the very top.  |  [ ` color ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/color/) |  ` blue ` (typst built-in)
` top-text ` |  The text at the top, just under the color bar  |  [ ` string ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) |  Empty
` pic ` |  Image to be used above the title block  |  [ ` string ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/image/#parameters-path) with path to the image  |  Empty
` title ` |  The title of the book  |  [ ` string ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) |  Empty
` title-align ` |  How the text is aligned (horizontally) in the title block  |  [ ` alignment ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/alignment/) |  ` left `
` subtitle ` |  Text that appears just below the title block  |  [ ` string ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) |  Empty
` publisher ` |  The name of the âpublisherâ in the bottom-left  |  [ ` string ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) |  O RLY  ?  (see example above)
` publisher-font ` |  Font to be used for âpublisherâ name  |  [ ` string(s) ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-font) |  Noto Sans, Arial Rounded MT, document context (in that order)
` signature ` |  Text in the bottom-right corner  |  [ ` string ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) |  Empty
` margin ` |  Page margins  |  [ ` length ` or ` dictionary ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-margin) |  ` top: 0 ` , all others will use the document context

===  Usage Notes

There are a couple quirks to data types and the like that may not be obvious.

  1. ` string ` s typically must be contained in quotation marks. But note that this will render quotation marks _within_ those strings without using [ smartquotes ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/smartquote/) . To avoid this, you may use content mode instead (by enclosing the text in square brackets ` [] ` ). For example, ` "Some title" ` â ` [Some title] `
     - Similarly, you can use this to toggle italics (e.g. ` [Italic text, _except_ this one] ` ) or apply other formatting
  2. Other types may look like strings but do *not* take quotes, specifically ` color ` (including when using the built-in color names) and ` alignment `
  3. With the ` margin ` type, if a single value is entered (without quotes), that value is applied to all four sides. All other usage must be done as a dictionary (meaning enclosed in parentheses), even if youâre only specifying one side. For example, the default is written ` (top: 0in) ` .
     - If youâre going to pass any value other than the top as an option, youâll likely want to add ` top: 0in ` back in to avoid a gap between the top of the page and the color bar
     - Any values passed to the function (or the default value if none are) will override any margin(s) set earlier in the ` typst ` file. So you can use a ` set ` rule at the beginning of the document without affecting the cover page

===  Images

The package uses ` typst ` âs built-in image handling, which means it only
supports PNG, JPG, and SVG.

The image will be resized to as close to 100% page width (inside the margins)
as possible while both maintaining proportions and avoiding any cropping. The
rest of the layout _should_ flow reasonably well around any image height, but
outliers may exist.

OâReilly-style animals can be found in the [ relevant section
](https://etc.usf.edu/clipart/galleries/730-animals) of the Florida Center for
Instructional Technologyâs [ ClipArt ETC ](https://etc.usf.edu/clipart/)
project. Just be aware that these are provided as GIFs(!), so conversion to
one of ` typst ` âs supported formats will be required.

==  Bugs & Feature Requests

I put this whole thing together in an afternoon when I shouldâve been doing
work for my day job. Granted Iâd already done a basic version for a seminary
writing assignment (I love to spoof academic writing), but either way, Iâve
gotten this project to a basic level of functionality and no further. Iâm
entirely open to suggestions for additional functionality, however, so feel
free to [ create an issue ](https://github.com/dei-layborer/o-rly-
typst/issues) if thereâs something youâd like to see added.

It hopefully goes without saying that the same is true if something breaks!

Tested on ` typst ` versions ` 0.11.1 ` and ` 0.12.0-rc1 ` .

==  Thanks & Shout-Outs

Shout out to Arthur Beaulieu ( [ @arthurbeaulieu
](https://github.com/ArthurBeaulieu) ), whose [ web-based generator
](https://arthurbeaulieu.github.io/ORlyGenerator/) served as both inspiration
and reference (I pretty much stole his layout settings).

Significant thanks to the folks in the [ typst discord
](https://discord.gg/2uDybryKPe) who helped me sort out some layout woes.

Extra double appreciation to Enivex on the discord for the name.

=  ilm

1.4.0

Versatile and minimal template for non-fiction writing. Ideal for class notes,
reports, and books

Featured  Template

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=ilm&version=1.4.0)

> âIlm (Urdu: Ø¹ÙÙÙÙ ) is the Urdu term for knowledge. It is pronounced
> as [ /É.lÉm/ ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85#Urdu) .

A versatile, clean and minimal template for non-fiction writing. The template
is ideal for class notes, reports, and books.

It contains a title page, a table of contents, and indices for different types
of figures; images, tables, code blocks.

Dynamic running footer contains the title of the chapter (top-level heading).

See the [ example.pdf ](https://github.com/talal/ilm/blob/main/example.pdf)
file to see how it looks.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` ilm ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command:



    typst init @preview/ilm


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` ilm `
function in a show rule. If you, however, want to change an existing project
to use this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your
file:



    #import "@preview/ilm:1.4.0": *

    #set text(lang: "en")

    #show: ilm.with(
      title: [Your Title],
      author: "Max Mustermann",
      date: datetime(year: 2024, month: 03, day: 19),
      abstract: [#lorem(30)],
      bibliography: bibliography("refs.bib"),
      figure-index: (enabled: true),
      table-index: (enabled: true),
      listing-index: (enabled: true)
    )

    // Your content goes below.


> [!NOTE] This template uses the [ Iosevka ](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) font
> for raw text. In order to use Iosevka, the font must be installed on your
> computer. In case Iosevka is not installed, as will be the case for Typst
> Web App, then the template will fall back to the default âFira Monoâ
> font.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` ilm ` function with the following named arguments:

Argument  |  Default Value  |  Type  |  Description
---|---|---|---
` title ` |  ` Your Title ` |  [ content ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) |  The title for your work.

` chapter-pagebreak ` |  ` true ` |  [ bool ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) |  Setting this to ` false ` will prevent chapters from starting on a new page.
` external-link-circle ` |  ` true ` |  [ bool ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) |  Setting this to ` false ` will disable the maroon circle that is shown next to external links.
` table-of-contents ` |  ` outline() ` |  [ content ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) |  The result of a call to the [ outline function ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/outline/) or none. Setting this to ` none ` will disable the table of contents.
` appendix ` |  ` (enabled: false, title: "Appendix", heading-numbering-format: "A.1.1.", body: none) ` |  [ dictionary ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/) |  Setting ` enabled ` to ` true ` and defining your content in ` body ` will display the appendix after the main body of your document and before the bibliography.
` bibliography ` |  ` none ` |  [ content ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) |  The result of a call to the [ bibliography function ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/bibliography/) or none. Specifying this will configure numeric, IEEE-style citations.
` figure-index ` |  ` (enabled: false, title: "Index of Figures") ` |  [ dictionary ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/) |  Setting this to ` true ` will display an index of image figures at the end of the document.
` table-index ` |  ` (enabled: false, title: "Index of Tables") ` |  [ dictionary ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/) |  Setting this to ` true ` will display an index of table figures at the end of the document.
` listing-index ` |  ` (enabled: false, title: "Index of Listings") ` |  [ dictionary ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/) |  Setting this to ` true ` will display an index of listing (code block) figures at the end of the document.

The above table gives you a _brief description_ of the different options that
you can choose to customize the template. For a detailed explanation of these
options, see the [ example.pdf
](https://github.com/talal/ilm/blob/main/example.pdf) file.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body.

> [!NOTE] The language setting for text ( ` lang ` parameter of ` text `
> function) should be defined before the ` ilm ` function so that headings
> such as table of contents and bibliography will be defined as per the text
> language.

==  Important notice regarding Tablex usage

*Summary: Please use built-in Typst tables instead of tablex.* Most of
tablexâs features were implemented in Typst 0.11.0, see the [ docs
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/table/) .

However, *keep an eye for future tablex updates* as there might be some
interesting goodies ahead, including CeTZ support!

*Details:*

A large amount of tablexâs features have successfully been upstreamed by
this packageâs author to Typstâs built-in ` table ` and ` grid ` elements
(see the new Tables Guide, at [ https://typst.app/docs/guides/table-guide/
](https://typst.app/docs/guides/table-guide/) , and the ` table ` elementâs
reference, at [ https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/table/
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/table/) , for more information).

This effort was tracked in the following Typst issue: [
https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/3001
](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/3001)

This means that, starting with Typst 0.11.0, *many advanced table features
can now be used with Typst grids and tables without tablex!* This includes:

  - Per-cell customization (through ` table.cell(inset: ..., align: ..., fill: ...)[body] ` , and ` #show table.cell: it => ... ` instead of ` map-cells ` );
  - Merging cells (colspans and rowspans, through ` table.cell(colspan: 2, rowspan: 2)[body] ` );
  - Line customization (you can control the ` stroke ` parameter of ` table.cell ` to control the lines around it, and you can use ` table.hline ` and ` table.vline ` which work similarly to their tablex counterparts - the equivalent of ` map-hlines ` and ` map-vlines ` is ` table(stroke: (x, y) => (left: ..., right: ..., top: ..., bottom: ...)) ` );
  - Repeatable table headers (through ` table.header(... cells ...) ` );
  - The features above are available within ` grid ` as well by replacing ` table ` with ` grid ` where applicable (e.g. ` grid.cell ` instead of ` table.cell ` ).

Additionally, built-in Typst tables have support for features which werenât
previously available within tablex, such as *repeatable table footers*
(through ` table.footer ` and ` grid.footer ` ).

Therefore, *for the vast majority of use cases, you will no longer need to
use this library.*

There are a few observations:

  1. *Tablex will still receive updates over time* with extra features. In the next version (tablex 0.1.0), there will be *support for CeTZ integration* , which will allow you to easily *annotate your tables* using CeTZ (e.g. draw arrows between cells). If youâre interested in such features, then tablex might still be useful for you in the future!
  2. *Not _all_ tablex features are present in built-in tables, at least yet. * Therefore, *if you happen to use the features listed below, you might still have to use tablex* depending on your use case. It is expected, however, that built-in tables will eventually have support for most of the missing features in future Typst releases. Hereâs a non-exhaustive list of them:
    1. Built-in tables do not yet have the ability to expand table lines by some arbitrary length.
    2. The tablex ` fit-spans ` option, through which colspans and rowspans donât cause ` auto ` -sized columns and/or rows to expand, is not yet supported in built-in tables.
    3. Built-in repeatable table headers currently always repeat in all pages, whereas you can define in which pages a tablex header should be repeated.
  3. *Regarding sponsorships:* Any future sponsorships to the tablex author, [ @PgBiel ](https://github.com/PgBiel) , who was also responsible for upstreaming the various tablex features to built-in tables, will go not only towards extended maintenance of tablex, but also towards other general contributions to the Typst ecosystem and his other open-source contributions! More information here: [ https://github.com/sponsors/PgBiel/ ](https://github.com/sponsors/PgBiel/)

If there any questions, feel free to open a thread in the ` Discussions ` page
of this repository, or ping the author on Discord. Thanks to everyone who
supported me throughout tablexâs development and the upstreaming process. I
hope you enjoy the new update, and have fun with tables! ð

And make sure to keep an eye for future tablex updates. ð

==  Usage

*NOTE: Please use built-in tables instead of this library* (see notice
above). *The rest of the README is kept for reference purposes only.*

To use this library through the Typst package manager *(for Typst v0.6.0+)*
, write for example ` #import "@preview/tablex:0.0.9": tablex, cellx ` at the
top of your Typst file (you may also add whichever other functions you use
from the library to that import list!).

For older Typst versions, download the file ` tablex.typ ` from the latest
release (or directly from the main branch, for the âbleeding edgeâ) at the
tablex repository ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex
](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex) ) and place it on the same folder as
your own Typst file. Then, at the top of your file, write for example `
#import "tablex.typ": tablex, cellx ` (plus whichever other functions you use
from the library).

This library should be compatible with Typst versions between v0.2.0 and
v0.12.0 (inclusive). *Using the latest Typst version is always recommended*
in order to make use of the latest optimizations and features available.

Hereâs an example of what ` tablex ` can do:

            let text-color = if value < 10 {
              red.lighten(30%)

==  Features

===  _Almost_ drop-in replacement for ` #table `

( *Update:* tablexâs syntax was designed to be compatible with Typst
tables created *up to Typst v0.10.0* . The new table features introduced in
Typst v0.11.0 use syntax which isnât compatible with tablex, so it wonât
be a drop-in replacement in that case. However, tablex does have its own
syntax for those features, as will be explained below!)

In most cases, you should be able to replace ` #table ` with ` #tablex ` and
be good to go for a start - it should look _very_ similar (if not identical).
Indeed, the syntax is very similar for the basics:



    #import "@preview/tablex:0.0.9": tablex

    #tablex(
      columns: (auto, 1em, 1fr, 1fr),  // 4 columns
      rows: auto,  // at least 1 row of auto size
      fill: red,
      align: center + horizon,
      stroke: green,
      [a], [b], [c], [d],
      [e], [f], [g], [h],
      [i], [j], [k], [l]
    )

images.githubusercontent.com/9021226/230818397-2d599324-32a5-4184-973f-2fcfb6b62c84.png)

There are still a few oddities in the library (see [ Known Issues
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tablex/0.0.9/#known-
issues) for more info), but, for the vast majority of cases, replacing `
#tablex ` by ` #table ` should work just fine. (Sometimes you can even replace
` #grid ` by ` #gridx ` \- see the line customization section for more -, but
not always, as the behavior is a bit different.)

This is mostly a word of caution in case anything I havenât anticipated
happens, but, based on my tests (and after tons of bug-fixing commits), the
vast majority of tables (that donât face one of the listed known issues)
should work just fine under the library.

*Note:* If your document is written in a right-to-left (RTL) script, you may
wish to enable ` rtl: true ` for your tables so that the order of cells and
lines properly follows your text direction (when combined with ` set text(dir:
rtl) ` ). This is necessary because tablex cannot detect that setting
automatically at the moment (while the native Typst table can and flips itself
horizontally automatically). See the tablex option reference for more
information.

===  colspanx/rowspanx

Your cells can now span more than one column and/or row at once, with `
colspanx ` / ` rowspanx ` :



    #import "@preview/tablex:0.0.9": tablex, colspanx, rowspanx

    #tablex(
      columns: 3,
      colspanx(2)[a], (),  [b],
      [c], rowspanx(2)[d], [ed],
      [f], (),             [g]
    )


![image](https://user-
images.githubusercontent.com/9021226/230810720-fbdfdbe5-8568-42ed-b8a2-5eff332a89d6.png)

Note that the empty parentheses there are just for organization, and are
ignored (unless they come before the first cell - more on that later).
Theyâre useful to help us keep track of which cell positions are being used
up by the spans, because, if we try to add an actual cell at these spots, it
will just push the others forward, which might seem unexpected.

Use ` colspanx(2, rowspanx(2)[d]) ` to colspan and rowspan at the same time.
Be careful not to attempt to overwrite other cellsâ spans, as you will get a
nasty error.

*Note (since tablex v0.0.8):* By default, colspans and rowspans can cause
spanned ` auto ` columns and rows to expand to fit their contents (only the
last spanned track - column or row - can expand). If youâd like colspans to
not affect column sizes at all (and thus âfitâ within their spanned
columns), you may specify ` fit-spans: (x: true) ` to the table. Similarly,
you can specify ` fit-spans: (y: true) ` to have rowspans not affect row sizes
at all. To apply both effects, use either ` fit-spans: true ` or ` fit-spans:
(x: true, y: true) ` . You can also apply this to a single colspan (for
example) with ` colspanx(2, fit-spans: (x: true))[a] ` , as this option is
available not only for the whole table but also for each cell. See the
reference section for more information.

===  Repeat header rows

You can now ensure the first row (or, rather, the rows covered by the first
rowspan) in your table repeats across pages. Just use ` repeat-header: true `
(default is ` false ` ).

Note that you may wish to customize this. Use ` repeat-header: 6 ` to repeat
for 6 more pages. Use ` repeat-header: (2, 4) ` to repeat only on the 2nd and
the 4th page (where the 1st page is the one the table starts in).
Additionally, use ` header-rows: 5 ` to ensure the first (e.g.) 5 rows are
part of the header (by default, this is 1 - more rows will be repeated where
necessary if rowspans are used).

Also, note that, by default, the horizontal lines below the header are
transported to other pages, which may be an annoyance if you customize lines
too much (see below). Use ` header-hlines-have-priority: false ` to ensure
that the first row in each page will dictate the appearance of the horizontal
lines above it (and not the header).

*Note:* Depending on the size of your document, repeatable headers might not
behave properly due to certain limitations in Typstâs introspection system
(as observed in [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/43
](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/43) ).

Example:



    #import "@preview/tablex:0.0.9": tablex, hlinex, vlinex, colspanx, rowspanx

    #pagebreak()
    #v(80%)

    #tablex(
      columns: 4,
      align: center + horizon,
      auto-vlines: false,
      repeat-header: true,

      /* --- header --- */
      rowspanx(2)[*Names*], colspanx(2)[*Properties*], (), rowspanx(2)[*Creators*],
      (),                 [*Type*], [*Size*], (),

===  Customize every single line

Every single line in the table is either a ` hlinex ` (horizontal) or ` vlinex
` (vertical) instance. By default, there is one between every column and
between every row - unless you specify a custom line for some column or row,
in which case the automatic line for it will be removed (to allow you to
freely customize it). To disable this behavior, use ` auto-lines: false ` ,
which will remove _all_ automatic lines. You may also remove only automatic
horizontal lines with ` auto-hlines: false ` , and only vertical with ` auto-
vlines: false ` .

*Note:* ` gridx ` is an alias for ` tablex ` with ` auto-lines: false ` .

For your custom lines, write ` hlinex() ` at any position and it will add a
horizontal line below the current cell row (or at the top, if before any
cell). You can use ` hlinex(start: a, end: b) ` to control the cells which
that line spans ( ` a ` is the first column number and ` b ` is the last
column number). You can also specify its stroke (color/thickness) with `
hlinex(stroke: red + 5pt) ` for example. To position it at an arbitrary row,
use ` hlinex(y: 6) ` or similar. (Columns and rows are indexed starting from
0.)

Something similar occurs for ` vlinex() ` , which has ` start ` , ` end `
(first row and last row it spans), and also ` stroke ` . They will, by
default, be placed to the right of the current cell, and will span the entire
table (top to bottom). To override the default placement, use ` vlinex(x: 2) `
or similar.

*Note:* Only one hline or vline with the same span (same start/end) can be
placed at once.

*Note:* You can also place vlines before the first cell, in which case _they
will be placed consecutively, each after the last` vlinex() ` _ . That is, if
you place several of them in a row ( _before the first cell_ only), then it
will not place all of them at one location (which is normally what happens if
you try to place multiple vlines at once), but rather one after the other.
With this behavior, you can also specify ` () ` between each vline to _skip_
certain positions (again, only before the first cell - afterwards, all ` () `
are ignored). Note that you can also just ignore this entirely and use `
vlinex(x: 0) ` , ` vlinex(x: 1) ` , â¦, ` vlinex(x: columns.len()) ` for full
control.

Hereâs some sample usage:



    #import "@preview/tablex:0.0.9": tablex, gridx, hlinex, vlinex, colspanx, rowspanx

    #tablex(
      columns: 4,
      auto-lines: false,

      // skip a column here         vv
      vlinex(), vlinex(), vlinex(), (), vlinex(),
      colspanx(2)[a], (),  [b], [J],
      [c], rowspanx(2)[d], [e], [K],
      [f], (),             [g], [L],
      //   ^^ '()' after the first cell are 100% ignored
    )

    #tablex(
      columns: 4,
      auto-vlines: false,
      colspanx(2)[a], (),  [b], [J],
      [c], rowspanx(2)[d], [e], [K],
      [f], (),             [g], [L],
    )

    #gridx(
      columns: 4,
      (), (), vlinex(end: 2),
      hlinex(stroke: yellow + 2pt),
      colspanx(2)[a], (),  [b], [J],
      hlinex(start: 0, end: 1, stroke: yellow + 2pt),
      hlinex(start: 1, end: 2, stroke: green + 2pt),
      hlinex(start: 2, end: 3, stroke: red + 2pt),
      hlinex(start: 3, end: 4, stroke: blue.lighten(50%) + 2pt),
      [c], rowspanx(2)[d], [e], [K],
      hlinex(start: 2),
      [f], (),             [g], [L],
    )

====  Bulk line customization

You can also _bulk-customize lines_ by specifying ` map-hlines: h => new_hline
` and ` map-vlines: v => new_vline ` . This includes any automatically
generated lines. For example:



    #import "@preview/tablex:0.0.9": tablex, colspanx, rowspanx

    #tablex(
      columns: 3,
      map-hlines: h => (..h, stroke: blue),
      map-vlines: v => (..v, stroke: green + 2pt),
      colspanx(2)[a], (),  [b],
      [c], rowspanx(2)[d], [ed],
      [f], (),             [g]
    )

images.githubusercontent.com/9021226/235371652-48e7e526-1eb0-43c3-a6f4-3ed81840cffc.png)

===  Customize every single cell

Cells can be customized entirely. Instead of specifying content (e.g. ` [text]
` ) as a table item, you can specify ` cellx(property: a, property: b,
...)[text] ` , which allows you to customize properties, such as:

  - ` colspan: 2 ` (same as using ` colspanx(2, ...)[...] ` )
  - ` rowspan: 3 ` (same as using ` rowspanx(3, ...)[...] ` )
  - ` align: center ` (override whole-table alignment for this cell)
  - ` fill: blue ` (fill just this cell with that color)
  - ` inset: 0pt ` (override inset/internal padding for this cell - note that this can look off unless you use auto columns and rows)
  - ` x: 5 ` (arbitrarily place the cell at the given column, beginning at 0 - may error if conflicts occur)
  - ` y: 6 ` (arbitrarily place the cell at the given row, beginning at 0 - may error if conflicts occur)

Additionally, instead of specifying content to the cell, you can specify a
function ` (column, row) => content ` , allowing each cell to be aware of
where itâs positioned. (Note that positions are recorded in the cellâs `
.x ` and ` .y ` attributes, and start as ` auto ` unless you specify
otherwise.)

For example:



    #import "@preview/tablex:0.0.9": tablex, cellx, colspanx, rowspanx

    #tablex(
      columns: 3,
      fill: red,
      align: right,
      colspanx(2)[a], (),  [beeee],
      [c], rowspanx(2)[d], cellx(fill: blue, align: left)[e],
      [f], (),             [g],

      // place this cell at the first column, seventh row
      cellx(colspan: 3, align: center, x: 0, y: 6)[hi I'm down here]
    )


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021226/230818283-b3b636db-
dbd0-47b8-bdd5-f61a07d58749.png)

====  Bulk customization of cells

To customize multiple cells at once, you have a few options:

  1. ` map-cells: cell => cell ` (given a cell, returns a new cell). You can use this to customize the cellâs attributes, but also to change its positions (however, avoid doing that as it can easily generate conflicts). You can access the cellâs position with ` cell.x ` and ` cell.y ` . All other attributes are also accessible and changeable (see the ` Reference ` further below for a list). Return something like ` (..cell, fill: blue) ` , for example, to ensure the other properties (including the cell type marker) are kept. (Calling ` cellx ` here is not necessary. If overriding the cellâs content, use ` content: [whatever] ` ). This is useful if you want to, for example, customize a cellâs fill color based on its contents, or add some content to every cell, or something similar.

  2. ` map-rows: (row_index, cells) => cells ` (given a row index and all cells in it, return a new array of cells). Allows customizing entire rows, but note that the cells in the ` cells ` parameter can be ` none ` if theyâre some position occupied by a colspan or rowspan of another cell. Ensure you return the cells in the order you were given, including the ` none ` s, for best results. Also, you cannot move cells here to another row. You can change the cellsâ columns (by changing their ` x ` property), but that will certainly generate conflicts if any col/rowspans are involved (in general, you cannot bulk-change col/rowspans without ` map-cells ` ).

  3. ` map-cols: (col_index, cells) => cells ` (given a column index and all cells in it, return a new array of cells). Similar to ` map-rows ` , but for customizing columns. You cannot change the column of any cell here. (To do that, ` map-cells ` is required.) You can, however, change its row (with ` y ` , but do that sparingly), and, of course, all other properties.

*Note:* Execution order is ` map-cells ` => ` map-rows ` => ` map-cols ` .

Example:



    #import "@preview/tablex:0.0.9": tablex, colspanx, rowspanx

    #tablex(
      columns: 4,
      auto-vlines: true,

      // make all cells italicized
      map-cells: cell => {
        (..cell, content: emph(cell.content))
      },

      // add some arbitrary content to entire rows
      map-rows: (row, cells) => cells.map(c =>
        if c == none {
          c  // keeping 'none' is important
        } else {
          (..c, content: [#c.content\ *R#row*])
        }
      ),

      // color cells based on their columns
      // (using 'fill: (column, row) => color' also works
      // for this particular purpose)
      map-cols: (col, cells) => cells.map(c =>
        if c == none {
          c
        } else {
          (..c, fill: if col < 2 { blue } else { yellow })
        }
      ),

      colspanx(2)[a], (),  [b], [J],
      [c], rowspanx(2)[dd], [e], [K],
      [f], (),             [g], [L],
    )

Another example (summing columns):



    #gridx(
      columns: 3,
      rows: 6,
      fill: (col, row) => (blue, red, green).at(calc.rem(row + col - 1, 3)),
      map-cols: (col, cells) => {
        let last = cells.last()
        last.content = [
          #cells.slice(0, cells.len() - 1).fold(0, (acc, c) => if c != none { acc + eval(c.content.text) } else { acc })
        ]
        last.fill = aqua
        cells.last() = last
        cells
      },
      [0], [5], [10],
      [1], [6], [11],
      [2], [7], [12],
      [3], [8], [13],
      [4], [9], [14],
      [s], [s], [s]

==  Known Issues

  - Filled cells will partially overlap with horizontal lines above them (see [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/4 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/4) ).

    - To be fixed in a future rework of the table drawing process.
  - Table lines donât play very well with column and row gutter when a colspan or rowspan is used. They may be missing or be cut off by gutters.

  - Repeatable table headers might not behave properly depending on the size of your document or other factors ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/43 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/43) ).

  - Using tablex (especially when using repeatable header rows) may cause a warning, âlayout did not converge within 5 attemptsâ, to appear on recent Typst versions ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/38 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/38) ). This warning is due to how tablex works internally *and is not your fault* (in principle), so donât worry too much about it (unless youâre sure itâs not tablex that is causing this).

  - Rows with fractional height (such as ` 2fr ` ) have zero height if the table spans more than one page. This is because fractional row heights are calculated on the available height of the first page of the table, which is something that the default ` #table ` can circumvent using internal code. This wonât be fixed for now. (Columns with fractional width work fine, provided all pages the table is in have the same width, *and the page width isnât` auto ` * (which forces fractional columns to be 0pt, even in the default ` #table ` ).)

  - Rotation (via Typstâs ` #rotate ` ) of text only affects the visual appearance of the text on the page, but does not change its dimensions as they factor into the layout. This leads to certain visual issues, such as rotated text potentially overflowing the cell height without being hyphenated or, inversely, being hyphenated even though there is enough space vertically ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/59 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/59) ). This is a [ known issue ](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/528) with Typst (perhaps, in the future, ` #rotate ` [ may ](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/528#issuecomment-1494123195) get a setting to affect layout). As a workaround for the text hyphenation problem, the content can be boxed (and thus grouped together) with ` #box ` (e.g., ` rowspanx(7, box(rotate(-90deg, [_donothyphenatethis_]))) ` ), or hyphenation can be prevented by setting ` #text(hyphenate: false, ...) ` (e.g., ` colspanx(2, text(hyphenate: false, rotate(-90deg, [_donothyphenatethis_]))) ` ), as also discussed in [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/59 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/59) ; another alternative is to use ` #place ` , e.g. aligning to ` center + horizon ` : ` cellx(place(center + horizon, rotate(-90deg, [_donothyphenatethis_]))) ` , which probably allows the most control over the in-cell layout, since it simply draws the rotated content without having it occupy any space (letting you define that by yourself, e.g. using ` box(width: 1em, height: 2em, place(...)) ` ).

    - Alternatively, you may attempt to use the solution proposed at [ https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/528#issuecomment-1494318510 ](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/528#issuecomment-1494318510) to define a ` rotatex ` function which produces a rotated element with the appropriate sizes, such that tablex may recognize its size accordingly and avoid visual glitches.
  - ` tablex ` can potentially be slower and/or take longer to compile than the default ` table ` (especially when the table spans a lot of pages). *Please use the latest Typst version to reduce this problem* (each version has been bringing further improvements in this sense). Still, we are looking for ways to better optimize the library (see more discussion at [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/5 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/5) \- feel free to give some input!). However, re-compilation is usually fine thanks to Typstâs built-in memoization.

  - The internals of the library still arenât very well documented; I plan on adding more info about this eventually.

  - *Please open a GitHub issue for anything weird you come across* (make sure others havenât reported it first).

where:

     - ` tablex-dict-type ` is the type marker
     - ` content ` is the cellâs content (either ` content ` or a function with ` (col, row) => content ` )
     - ` rowspan ` is how many rows this cell spans (default 1)
     - ` colspan ` is how many columns this cell spans (default 1)
     - ` align ` is this cellâs align override, such as âcenterâ (default ` auto ` to follow the rest of the table)

     - ` inset ` is this cellâs inset override, such as ` 5pt ` (default ` auto ` to follow the rest of the table)
     - ` fit-spans ` allows overriding the table-wide ` fit-spans ` setting for this specific cell (e.g. if this cell has a ` colspan ` greater than 1, ` fit-spans: (x: true) ` will cause it to not affect the sizes of ` auto ` columns).
     - ` x ` is the cellâs column index (0â¦len-1) - ` auto ` indicates it wasnât assigned yet
     - ` y ` is the cellâs row index (0â¦len-1) - ` auto ` indicates it wasnât assigned yet
  2. ` hlinex ` : represents a horizontal line:

        #let hlinex(
      start: 0, end: auto, y: auto,
      stroke: auto,
      stop-pre-gutter: auto, gutter-restrict: none,
      stroke-expand: true,
      expand: none

      gutter-restrict: gutter-restrict,
      stroke-expand: stroke-expand,
      expand: expand,
      parent: none,
    )


where:

     - ` tablex-dict-type ` is the type marker
     - ` start ` is the column index where the hline starts from (default ` 0 ` , a.k.a. the beginning)
     - ` end ` is the last column the hline touches (default ` auto ` , a.k.a. all the way to the end)
       - Note that hlines will _not_ be drawn over cells with ` colspan ` larger than 1, even if their spans ( ` start ` \- ` end ` ) include that cell.
     - ` y ` is the index of the row at the top of which the hline is drawn. (Defaults to ` auto ` , a.k.a. depends on where you placed the ` hline ` among the table items - itâs always on the top of the row below the current one.)
     - ` stroke ` is the hlineâs stroke override (defaults to ` auto ` , a.k.a. follow the rest of the table).
     - ` stop-pre-gutter ` : When ` true ` , the hline will not be drawn over gutter (which is the default behavior of tables). Defaults to ` auto ` which is essentially ` false ` (draw over gutter).
     - ` gutter-restrict ` : Either ` top ` , ` bottom ` , or ` none ` . Has no effect if ` row-gutter ` is set to ` none ` . Otherwise, defines if this ` hline ` should be drawn only on the top of the row gutter ( ` top ` ); on the bottom ( ` bottom ` ); or on both the top and the bottom ( ` none ` , the default). Note that ` top ` and ` bottom ` are alignment values (not strings).
     - ` stroke-expand ` : When ` true ` , the hline will be extended as necessary to cover the stroke of the vlines going through either end of the line. Defaults to ` true ` .
     - ` expand ` : Optionally extend the hline by an arbitrary length. When ` none ` , it is not expanded. When a length (such as ` 5pt ` ), it is expanded by that length on both ends. When an array of two lengths (such as ` (5pt, 10pt) ` ), it is expanded to the left by the first length (in this case, ` 5pt ` ) and to the right by the second (in this case, ` 10pt ` ). Defaults to ` none ` .
     - ` parent ` : An internal attribute determined when splitting lines among cells. (It should always be ` none ` on user-facing interfaces.)
  3. ` vlinex ` : represents a vertical line:

        #let vlinex(
      start: 0, end: auto, x: auto,
      stroke: auto,
      stop-pre-gutter: auto, gutter-restrict: none,
      stroke-expand: true,
      expand: none
    ) = (
      tablex-dict-type: "vline",
      start: start,
      end: end,
      x: x,
      stroke: stroke,
      stop-pre-gutter: stop-pre-gutter,
      gutter-restrict: gutter-restrict,
      stroke-expand: stroke-expand,
      expand: expand,
      parent: none,
    )


where:

     - ` tablex-dict-type ` is the type marker
     - ` start ` is the row index where the vline starts from (default ` 0 ` , a.k.a. the top)
     - ` end ` is the last row the vline touches (default ` auto ` , a.k.a. all the way to the bottom)
       - Note that vlines will _not_ be drawn over cells with ` rowspan ` larger than 1, even if their spans ( ` start ` \- ` end ` ) include that cell.
     - ` x ` is the index of the column to the left of which the vline is drawn. (Defaults to ` auto ` , a.k.a. depends on where you placed the ` vline ` among the table items.)
       - For a ` vline ` to be placed after all columns, its ` x ` value will be equal to the amount of columns (which isnât a valid column index, but itâs what is used here).
     - ` stroke ` is the vlineâs stroke override (defaults to ` auto ` , a.k.a. follow the rest of the table).
     - ` stop-pre-gutter ` : When ` true ` , the vline will not be drawn over gutter (which is the default behavior of tables). Defaults to ` auto ` which is essentially ` false ` (draw over gutter).
     - ` gutter-restrict ` : Either ` left ` , ` right ` , or ` none ` . Has no effect if ` column-gutter ` is set to ` none ` . Otherwise, defines if this ` vline ` should be drawn only to the left of the column gutter ( ` left ` ); to the right ( ` right ` ); or on both the left and the right ( ` none ` , the default). Note that ` left ` and ` right ` are alignment values (not strings).
     - ` stroke-expand ` : When ` true ` , the vline will be extended as necessary to cover the stroke of the hlines going through either end of the line. Defaults to ` true ` .
     - ` expand ` : Optionally extend the vline by an arbitrary length. When ` none ` , it is not expanded. When a length (such as ` 5pt ` ), it is expanded by that length on both ends. When an array of two lengths (such as ` (5pt, 10pt) ` ), it is expanded towards the top by the first length (in this case, ` 5pt ` ) and towards the bottom by the second (in this case, ` 10pt ` ). Defaults to ` none ` .
     - ` parent ` : An internal attribute determined when splitting lines among cells. (It should always be ` none ` on user-facing interfaces.)
  4. The ` occupied ` type is an internal type used to represent cell positions occupied by cells with ` colspan ` or ` rowspan ` greater than 1.

  5. Use ` is-tablex-cell ` , ` is-tablex-hline ` , ` is-tablex-vline ` and ` is-tablex-occupied ` to check if a particular object has the corresponding type marker.

  6. ` colspanx ` and ` rowspanx ` are shorthands for setting the ` colspan ` and ` rowspan ` attributes of ` cellx ` . They can also be nested (one given as an argument to the other) to combine their properties (e.g., ` colspanx(2)(rowspanx(3)[a]) ` ). They accept all other cell properties with named arguments. For example, ` colspanx(2, align: center)[b] ` is equivalent to ` cellx(colspan: 2, align: center)[b] ` .

===  Gridx and Tablex

  1. ` gridx ` is equivalent to ` tablex ` with ` auto-lines: false ` ; see below.

  2. ` tablex: ` The main function for creating a table with this library:

        #let tablex(
      columns: auto, rows: auto,
      inset: 5pt,
      align: auto,
      fill: none,
      stroke: auto,
      column-gutter: auto, row-gutter: auto,
      gutter: none,
      repeat-header: false,
      header-rows: 1,
      header-hlines-have-priority: true,
      auto-lines: true,
      auto-hlines: auto,
      auto-vlines: auto,
      map-cells: none,
      map-hlines: none,
      map-vlines: none,
      map-rows: none,
      map-cols: none,
      ..items
    ) = {
    // ...
    }


*Parameters:*

     - ` columns ` : The sizes (widths) of each column. They work just like regular ` table ` âs columns, and can be:

       - an array of lengths ( ` 1pt ` , ` 2em ` , ` 100% ` , â¦), including fractional ( ` 2fr ` ), to specify the width of each column
         - For instance, ` columns: (2pt, 3em) ` will give you two columns: one with a width of ` 2pt ` and another with the width of ` 3em ` (3 times the font size).
           - Note that percentages, such as ` 49% ` , *are considered fixed widths* as they are *always multiplied by the full page width* (minus margins) for columns. Thus, a column with a size of ` 100% ` would span your whole page (even if there are other columns).
         - ` auto ` may be specified to automatically resize the column based on the largest width of its contents, if possible - *this is the most common column width choice,* as it just delegates the column sizing job to tablex!
           - For example, if your ` auto ` -sized column contains two cells with ` Hello world! ` and ` Bye! ` as contents, tablex will try to make the column large enough for ` Hello world! ` (the cell with largest _potential_ width) to fit in a single line.
           - However, note that often enough thatâs not possible, as increasing the columnâs size too much would result in the table going over the pageâs margin - perhaps even beyond the documentâs total width. Therefore, *tablex will automatically reduce the size of your` auto ` columns * when they would otherwise cause the table to overrun the pageâs normal width (i.e. the width between the pageâs lateral margins).
             - Fixed width columns (such as ` 2pt ` , ` 3em ` or ` 49% ` ) are not subject to this size reduction; thus, if you specify all columnsâ widths with fixed lengths, your table _could_ become larger than the pageâs width! (In such a case, *` auto ` columns would be reduced to a size of zero, * as there would be no available space anymore!)
         - when specifying fractional widths ( ` 1fr ` , ` 2fr ` â¦) for columns, the available space (remaining page width, after calculating all other columnsâ sizes) is divided between them, weighted on the fraction value of each column.
           - For example, with ` (1fr, 2fr) ` , the available space will be divided by 3 (1 + 2), and the first column will have 1/3 of the space, while the second will have 2/3.
             - ` (1fr, 1fr) ` would cause both columns to have equal length (1/2 and 1/2 of the available space).
           - This is useful when you want some columns to just occupy all the remaining horizontal space in the page.
             - *Note:* If only one column has a fractional width (e.g. a single column with ` 1fr ` ), it will occupy the entire available space.
           - *Warning:* fractional columns in tablex (much like in Typstâs default tables) *will not work properly in pages with` auto ` width * (the columns will have width zero) - this is because those pages theoretically have infinite width (they can expand indefinitely), so having columns spanning the entire available width is then impossible!
       - a single length like above, to indicate the width of a single column (equivalent to just placing it inside a unit array)
         - For instance, ` columns: 2pt ` is equivalent to ` columns: (2pt,) ` , which translates to a single column of width ` 2pt ` .
       - an integer (such as ` 4 ` ), as a shorthand for ` (auto,) * 4 ` (that many ` auto ` columns)
         - Useful if you just want to quickly set the amount of columns without worrying about their sizes ( ` columns: 4 ` will give you four ` auto ` columns).
     - ` rows ` : The sizes (heights) of each row. They follow the exact same format as ` columns ` , except that the âavailable spaceâ is infinite (auto rows can expand as much as is needed, as the table can add rows over multiple pages).

       - *Note:* For rows, percentages (such as ` 49% ` ) are fixed width lengths, like in ` columns ` ; however, here, they are *multiplied by the pageâs full height* (minus margins), and not width.
       - *Note:* If more rows than specified are added, the height for the *last row* will be the one assigned to all extra rows. (If the last row is ` auto ` , the extra ones will also be ` auto ` , for example.)
         - Your table can have more rows than expected by simply having more cells than ` (# columns) ` multiplied by ` (# rows) ` . In this case, you will have an extra row for each ` (# columns) ` cells after the limit. In other words, *the amount of columns is always fixed* (determined by the amount of widths in the array given to ` columns ` ), but the amount of rows can vary depending on your input of cells to the table.
         - Adding a cell at an arbitrary ` y ` coordinate can also cause your table to have extra rows (enough rows to reach the cell at that coordinate).
       - *Warning:* support for fractional sizes for rows is still rudimentary - they only work properly on the tableâs first page; on the second page and onwards, they will not behave properly, differently from the default ` #table ` .
     - ` inset ` : Inset/internal padding to give to each cell. Can be either a length (same inset from the top, bottom, left and right of the cell), or a dictionary (e.g. ` (left: 5pt, right: 10pt, bottom: 2pt, top: 4pt) ` , or even ` (left: 5pt, rest: 10pt) ` to apply the same value to the remaining sides). Defaults to ` 5pt ` (the ` #table ` default).

     - ` align ` : How to align text in the cells. Defaults to ` auto ` , which inherits alignment from the outer context. Must be either ` auto ` , an ` alignment ` (such as ` left ` or ` top ` ), a ` 2d alignment ` (such as ` left + top ` ), an ` array ` of alignment/2d alignment (one for each column in the table - if there are more columns than alignment values, they will alternate); or a function ` (column, row) => alignment/2d alignment ` (to customize for each individual cell).

     - ` fill ` : Color with which to fill cellsâ backgrounds. Defaults to ` none ` , or no fill. Must be either a ` color ` , such as ` blue ` ; an ` array ` of colors (one for each column in the table - if there are more columns than colors, they will alternate); or a function ` (column, row) => color ` (to customize for each individual cell).

     - ` stroke ` : Indicates how to draw the table lines. Defaults to the current line styles in the document. For example: ` 5pt + red ` to change the color and the thickness.

     - ` column-gutter ` : optional separation (length) between columns (such as ` 5pt ` ). Defaults to ` none ` (disable). At the moment, looks a bit ugly if your table has a ` hline ` attempting to cross a ` colspan ` .

     - ` row-gutter ` : optional separation (length) between rows. Defaults to ` none ` (disable). At the moment, looks a bit ugly if your table has a ` vline ` attempting to cross a ` rowspan ` .

     - ` gutter ` : Sets a length to both ` column- ` and ` row-gutter ` at the same time (overridable by each).

     - ` repeat-header ` : Controls header repetition. If set to ` true ` , the first row (or the amount of rows specified in ` header-rows ` ), including its rowspans, is repeated across all pages this table spans. If set to ` false ` (default), the aforementioned header row is not repeated in any page. If set to an integer (such as ` 4 ` ), repeats for that many pages after the first, then stops. If set to an array of integers (such as ` (3, 4) ` ), repeats only on those pages _relative to the tableâs first page_ (page 1 here is where the table is, so adding ` 1 ` to said array has no effect).

     - ` header-rows ` : minimum amount of rows for the repeatable header. 1 by default. Automatically increases if one of the cells is a rowspan that would go beyond the given amount of rows. For example, if 3 is given, then at least the first 3 rows will repeat.

     - ` header-hlines-have-priority ` : if ` true ` , the horizontal lines below the header being repeated take priority over the rows they appear atop of on further pages. If ` false ` , they draw their own horizontal lines. Defaults to ` true ` .

       - For example, if your header has a blue hline under it, that blue hline will display on all pages it is repeated on if this option is ` true ` . If this option is ` false ` , the header will repeat, but the blue hline will not.
     - ` rtl ` : if true, the table is horizontally flipped. That is, cells and lines are placed in the opposite order (starting from the right), and horizontal lines are flipped. This is meant to simulate the behavior of default Typst tables when ` set text(dir: rtl) ` is used, and is useful when writing in a language with a RTL (right-to-left) script. Defaults to ` false ` .

     - ` auto-lines ` : Shorthand to apply a boolean to both ` auto-hlines ` and ` auto-vlines ` at the same time (overridable by each). Defaults to ` true ` .

     - ` auto-hlines ` : If ` true ` , draw a horizontal line on every line where you did not manually draw one; if ` false ` , no hlines other than the ones you specify (via ` hlinex ` ) are drawn. Defaults to ` auto ` (follows ` auto-lines ` , which in turn defaults to ` true ` ).

     - ` auto-vlines ` : If ` true ` , draw a vertical line on every line where you did not manually draw one; if ` false ` , no vlines other than the ones you specify (via ` vlinex ` ) are drawn. Defaults to ` auto ` (follows ` auto-lines ` , which in turn defaults to ` true ` ).

     - ` map-cells ` : A function which takes a single ` cellx ` and returns another ` cellx ` , or a ` content ` which is converted to ` cellx ` by ` cellx[#content] ` . You can customize the cell in pretty much any way using this function; just take care to avoid conflicting with already-placed cells if you move it.

     - ` map-hlines ` : A function which takes each horizontal line object ( ` hlinex ` ) and returns another, optionally modifying its properties. You may also change its row position ( ` y ` ). Note that this is also applied to lines generated by ` auto-hlines ` .

     - ` map-vlines ` : A function which takes each horizontal line object ( ` vlinex ` ) and returns another, optionally modifying its properties. You may also change its column position ( ` x ` ). Note that this is also applied to lines generated by ` auto-vlines ` .

     - ` map-rows ` : A function mapping each row of cells to new values or modified properties. Takes ` (row_num, cell_array) ` and returns the modified ` cell_array ` . Note that, with your function, they cannot be sent to another row. Also, please preserve the order of the cells. This is especially important given that cells may be ` none ` if theyâre actually a position taken by another cell with colspan/rowspan. Make sure the ` none ` values are in the same indexes when the array is returned.

     - ` map-cols ` : A function mapping each column of cells to new values or modified properties. Takes ` (col_num, cell_array) ` and returns the modified ` cell_array ` . Note that, with your function, they cannot be sent to another column. Also, please preserve the order of the cells. This is especially important given that cells may be ` none ` if theyâre actually a position taken by another cell with colspan/rowspan. Make sure the ` none ` values are in the same indexes when the array is returned.

     - ` fit-spans ` : either a dictionary ` (x: bool, y: bool) ` or just ` bool ` (e.g. just ` true ` is converted to ` (x: true, y: true) ` ). When given ` (x: true) ` , colspans wonât affect the sizes of ` auto ` columns. When given ` (y: true) ` , rowspans wonât affect the sizes of ` auto ` rows. By default, this is equal to ` (x: false, y: false) ` (equivalent to just ` false ` ), which means that colspans will cause the last spanned ` auto ` column to expand (depending on the contents of the cell) and rowspans will cause the last spanned ` auto ` row to expand similarly.

       - This is usually used as ` (x: true) ` to prevent unexpected expansion of ` auto ` columns after using a colspan, which can happen when a colspan spans both a fractional-size column (e.g. ` 1fr ` ) and an ` auto ` -sized column. Can be applied to rows too through ` (y: true) ` or ` (x: true, y: true) ` , if needed, however.
       - The point of this option is to have colspans and rowspans not affect the size of the table at all, and just âfitâ within the columns and rows they span. Therefore, this option does not have any effect upon colspans and rowspans which donât span columns or rows with automatic size.

==  Changelog

===  v0.0.9

*NOTE:* Please use Typstâs built-in tables instead of tablex (starting
with Typst 0.11.0). Most of tablexâs features were implemented in Typstâs
tables by the author of tablex.

  - Added compatibility with Typst v0.12.0 ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/135 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/135) )
  - Added library usage notice to README
  - Tablex is now dual-licensed under MIT/Apache-2.0 ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/134 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/134) )

===  v0.0.8

  - Added ` fit-spans ` option to ` tablex ` and ` cellx ` ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/111 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/111) )
    - Accepts ` (x: bool, y: bool) ` . When set to ` (x: true) ` , colspans wonât affect the sizes of ` auto ` columns. When set to ` (y: true) ` , rowspans wonât affect the sizes of ` auto ` rows.
    - Defaults to ` false ` , equivalent to ` (x: false, y: false) ` , that is, colspans and rowspans affect the sizes of ` auto ` tracks (columns and rows) by default (expanding the last spanned track if the colspan/rowspan is too large).
    - Useful when you want merged cells (or a specific merged cell) to âfitâ within their spanned columns and rows. May help when adding a colspan or rowspan causes an ` auto ` -sized track to inadvertently expand.
  - ` auto ` column sizing received multiple improvements and bug fixes. Tables should now have more natural column widths. ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/109 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/109) , [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/116 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/116) )
    - Fixes some problems with overflowing cells ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/48 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/48) , [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/75 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/75) )
    - Fixes ` auto ` columns being needlessly expanded in some cases ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/56 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/56) , [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/78 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/78) )
      - For similar problems not fixed by this, please use the new ` fit-spans ` option as needed, or use fixed-size columns instead.
  - Several performance optimizations and other internal code improvements were made ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/113 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/113) , [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/114 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/114) , [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/115 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/115) ).
    - Documents with lots of ` tablex ` tables might now become *up to 20% faster* to cold compile. Give it a shot!
  - Fixed extra fixed-height rows appearing to have ` auto ` height ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/108 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/108) ).
  - Fixed rows without any visible cells being drawn with zero height ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/107 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/107) ).
    - Fixes some rowspans causing cells to overlap ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/82 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/82) , [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/105 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/105) ).

  - Fixed negative line expansion within a single cell ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/84 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/84) )
    - Negative line expansion across multiple cells isnât yet supported.
    - Thanks GitHub user @dixslyf for the great work on fixing and testing this!
  - Made internal length calculation procedures more robust ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/92 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/92) , [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/94 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/94) )
    - Fixes a potential incompatibility with (currently unreleased) Typst 0.11.0
  - Added missing support for boolean types in Typst 0.8.0+ ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/73 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/73) )
  - Added some keywords to tablexâs ` typst.toml ` for better discoverability ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/91 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/91) )

===  v0.0.6

  - Added support for RTL tables with ` rtl: true ` ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/58 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/58) ).
    - Default Typst tables are automatically flipped horizontally when using ` set text(dir: rtl) ` , however we canât detect that setting from tablex at this moment (it isnât currently possible to fetch set rules in Typst).
    - Therefore, as a way around that, you can now specify ` #tablex(rtl: true, ...) ` to flip your table horizontally if youâre writing a document in RTL (right-to-left) script. (You can use e.g. ` #let old-tablex = tablex ` followed by ` #let tablex(..args) = old-tablex(rtl: true, ..args) ` to not have to repeat the ` rtl ` parameter every time.)
  - Added support for ` box ` âs dictionary inset syntax on tablex ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/54 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/54) ).
    - For instance, you can now do ` #tablex(inset: (left: 5pt, top: 10pt, rest: 2pt), ...) ` .
  - Fixed errors when using floating point strokes or other more complex strokes ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/55 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/55) ).
  - Added full compatibility with the new Typst 0.8.0 type system ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/69 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/69) ).
  - Added info about ` #rotate ` problems to âKnown Issuesâ in the README ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/60 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/pull/60) ).
  - Improved docs for tablex options ` columns ` and ` rows ` ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/53 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/53) ).

===  v0.0.5

  - â ï¸ *Minimum Typst version raised to v0.2.0*
  - Improved calculation of page/container dimensions by using the ` layout() ` function.
    - Fixes tables with fractional columns not displaying properly in blocks with ` auto ` width ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/44 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/44) ; [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/39 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/39) )
    - Fixes some nested tables overflowing the page width ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/41 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/41) )
    - Fixes bad interaction between tables with fractional columns and nested tables ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/28 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/28) )
    - Fixes table rotation messing up table size calculation ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/52 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/52) )
    - Probably fixes other issues not listed here as well.
  - Added some guards for infinite lengths and ` auto ` -sized pages ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/47 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/47) ).
  - Fixed tablex crashes/improper behavior with ` em ` strokes and other types of strokes ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/49 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/49) ).
  - Added the tablex version number as a comment in the source file (as requested in [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/25 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/25) ).

===  v0.0.4

  - Added ` typst.toml ` to support Typst v0.6.0âs soon-to-be-released package manager (see [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/22 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/22) ).
  - Fixed a division by zero regression from v0.0.3 ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/19 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/19) ).
  - Fixed a bug where cells placed in arbitrary positions could force an extra empty row to appear ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/16 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/16) ).
  - Fixed ` hlinex(gutter-restrict: top) ` causing the hline to just disappear ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/20 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/20) ).
  - Fixed certain ` gutter-restrict ` lines disappearing when thereâs no gutter ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/21 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/21) ).
  - Fixed row gutter lines not properly splitting across pages ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/23 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/23) ).

===  v0.0.3

  - Added support for Typst v0.4.0 and v0.5.0.
    - The tablex options ` fill: ` and ` align: ` now accept arrays of values for each column ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/13 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/13) ).
      - For example, ` fill: (red, blue) ` would fill the first column with red, the second column with blue, and any further columns would alternate between the two fill colors.
  - Fixed the calculation of the size of ` auto ` rows and columns when a rowspan or colspan was used ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/11 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/11) ).
  - Fixed the calculation of the size of the last ` auto ` column when it was too long ( [ https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/6 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/issues/6) ).

===  v0.0.2

  - Added support for Typst v0.3.0.
  - Fixed strokes - now lines will expand to not look weird when strokes are larger.
    - You can disable this behavior by setting ` stroke-expand: false ` on your lines.
  - You can now arbitrarily change your linesâ sizes at either end with the option ` expand: (length, length) ` ; e.g. ` expand: (5pt, 10pt) ` will increase your horizontal line 5pt to the left and 10pt to the right (or, for a vertical line, 5pt to the top and 10pt to the bottom).
    - Support for negative expand lengths is limited (so far, only reduces length in the first cell the line spans).
  - Added some gutter fixes (not all gutter issues were fixed yet).

===  v0.0.1

Initial release.

  - Added types ` tablex ` , ` cellx ` , ` hlinex ` , ` vlinex `
  - Added type aliases ` gridx ` , ` rowspanx ` , ` colspanx `

=  lemmify

0.1.6

Theorem typesetting library.

Lemmify is a library for typesetting mathematical theorems in typst. It aims
to be easy to use while trying to be as flexible and idiomatic as possible.
This means that the interface might change with updates to typst (for example
if user-defined element functions are introduced). But no functionality should
be lost.

==  Basic Usage

To get started with Lemmify, follow these steps:

  1. Import the Lemmify library:



    #import "@preview/lemmify:0.1.6": *


  2. Define the default styling for a few default theorem types:



    #let (
      theorem, lemma, corollary,
      remark, proposition, example,
      proof, rules: thm-rules
    ) = default-theorems("thm-group", lang: "en")


  3. Apply the generated styling:



    #show: thm-rules


  4. Create theorems, lemmas, and proofs using the defined styling:



    #theorem(name: "Some theorem")[
      Theorem content goes here.
    ]<thm>

    #proof[
      Complicated proof.
    ]<proof>

    @proof and @thm[theorem]


  5. Customize the styling further using show rules. For example, to add a red box around proofs:



    #show thm-selector("thm-group", subgroup: "proof"): it => box(
      it,
      stroke: red + 1pt,
      inset: 1em
    )


The result should now look something like this:

![image](https://github.com/Marmare314/lemmify/assets/49279081/ba5e7ed4-336d-4b1a-8470-99fa23bf5119)

==  Useful examples

If you do not want to reset the theorem counter on headings you can use the `
max-reset-level ` parameter:



    default-theorems("thm-group", max-reset-level: 0)


It specifies the highest level at which the counter is reset. To manually
reset the counter you can use the ` thm-reset-counter ` function.

- * *

By specifying ` numbering: none ` you can create unnumbered theorems.



    #example(numbering: none)[
      Some example.
    ]


To make all examples unnumbered you could use the following code:



    #let example = example.with(numbering: none)


- * *

To create other types (or subgroups) of theorems you can use the ` new-
theorems ` function.



    #let (note, rules) = new-theorems("thm-group", ("note": text(red)[Note]))
    #show: rules


If you have already defined custom styling you will notice that the newly
created theorem does not use it. You can create a dictionary to make applying
it again easier.



    #let my-styling = (
      thm-styling: thm-styling-simple,
      thm-numbering: ..,
      ref-styling: ..
    )

    #let (note, rules) = new-theorems("thm-group", ("note": "Note), ..my-styling)


- * *

By varying the ` group ` parameter you can create independently numbered
theorems:



    #let (
      theorem, proof,
      rules: thm-rules-a
    ) = default-theorems("thm-group-a")
    #let (
      definition,
      rules: thm-rules-b
    ) = default-theorems("thm-group-b")

    #show: thm-rules-a
    #show: thm-rules-b


- * *

To specify parameters of the [ styling
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lemmify/0.1.6/#styling-
parameters) functions the ` .with ` function is used.



    #let (
      theorem,
      rules: thm-rules
    ) = default-theorems(
      "thm-group",
      thm-numbering: thm-numbering-heading.with(max-heading-level: 2)
    )


==  Example



    #import "@preview/lemmify:0.1.6": *

    #let my-thm-style(
      thm-type, name, number, body
    ) = grid(
      columns: (1fr, 3fr),
      column-gutter: 1em,
      stack(spacing: .5em, strong(thm-type), number, emph(name)),
      body
    )

    #let my-styling = (
      thm-styling: my-thm-style
    )

    #let (
      theorem, rules
    ) = default-theorems("thm-group", lang: "en", ..my-styling)
    #show: rules
    #show thm-selector("thm-group"): box.with(inset: 1em)

    #lorem(20)
    #theorem[
      #lorem(40)
    ]
    #lorem(20)
    #theorem(name: "Some theorem")[
      #lorem(30)
    ]

==  Documentation

The two most important functions are:

` default-theorems ` : Create a default set of theorems based on the given
language and styling.

  - ` group ` : The group id.
  - ` lang ` : The language to which the theorems are adapted.
  - ` thm-styling ` , ` thm-numbering ` , ` ref-styling ` : Styling parameters are explained in further detail in the [ Styling ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lemmify/0.1.6/#styling-parameters) section.
  - ` proof-styling ` : Styling which is only applied to proofs.
  - ` max-reset-level ` : The highest heading level on which theorems are still reset.

` new-theorems ` : Create custom sets of theorems with the given styling.

  - ` group ` : The group id.
  - ` subgroup-map ` : Mapping from group id to some argument. The simple styles use ` thm-type ` as the argument (ie âBeispielâ or âExampleâ for group id âexampleâ)
  - ` thm-styling ` , ` thm-numbering ` , ` ref-styling ` , ` ref-numbering ` : Styling which to apply to all subgroups.

- * *

` use-proof-numbering ` : Decreases the numbering of a theorem function by
one. See [ Styling
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lemmify/0.1.6/#styling)
for more information.

- * *

` thm-selector ` : Returns a selector for all theorems of the specified group.
If subgroup is specified, only the theorems belonging to it will be selected.

- * *

There are also a few functions to help with resetting counters.

` thm-reset-counter ` : Reset theorem group counter manually. Returned content
needs to added to the document.

` thm-reset-counter-heading-at ` : Reset theorem group counter at headings of
the specified level. Returns a rule that needs to be shown.

` thm-reset-counter-heading ` : Reset theorem group counter at headings of at
most the specified level. Returns a rule that needs to be shown.

===  Styling parameters

If possible the best way to adapt the look of theorems is to use show rules as
shown [ above
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/lemmify/0.1.6/#basic-
usage) , but this is not always possible. For example if we wanted theorems to
start with ` 1.1 Theorem ` instead of ` Theorem 1.1 ` . You can provide the
following functions to adapt the look of the theorems.

- * *

` thm-styling ` : A function: ` (arg, name, number, body) -> content ` , that
allows you to define the styling for different types of theorems. Below only
the ` arg ` will be specified.

Pre-defined functions

  - ` thm-style-simple(thm-type) ` : *thm-type num* _(name)_ body
  - ` thm-style-proof(thm-type) ` : *thm-type num* _(name)_ body â¡
  - ` thm-style-reversed(thm-type) ` : *num thm-type* _(name)_ body

- * *

` thm-numbering ` : A function: ` figure -> content ` , that determines how
theorems are numbered.

Pre-defined functions: (Assume heading is 1.1 and theorem count is 2)

  - ` thm-numbering-heading ` : 1.1.2
    - ` max-heading-level ` : only use the a limited number of subheadings. In this case if it is set to ` 1 ` the result would be ` 1.2 ` instead.
  - ` thm-numbering-linear ` : 2
  - ` thm-numbering-proof ` : No visible content is returned, but the counter is reduced by 1 (so that the proof keeps the same count as the theorem). Useful in combination with ` use-proof-numbering ` to create theorems that reference the previous theorem (like proofs).

- * *

` ref-styling ` : A function: ` (arg, thm-numbering, ref) -> content ` , to
style theorem references.

Pre-defined functions:

  - ` thm-ref-style-simple(thm-type) `
    - ` @thm -> thm-type 1.1 `
    - ` @thm[custom] -> custom 1.1 `

- * *

` ref-numbering ` : Same as ` thm-numbering ` but only applies to the
references.

==  Roadmap

  - More pre-defined styles.
    - Referencing theorems by name.
  - Support more languages.
  - Better documentation.
  - Outlining theorems.

=  codly

1.0.0

Codly is a beautiful code presentation template with many features like smart
indentation, line numbering, highlighting, etc.

Featured  Package

[
![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/website?down_message=offline&label=manual&up_color=007aff&up_message=online&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDherse%2Fcodly%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fdocs.pdf)
](https://github.com/Dherse/codly/blob/main/docs.pdf) [ ![MIT
License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)
](https://github.com/Dherse/codly/blob/main/LICENSE)
![](https://github.com/Dherse/codly/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

Codly is a package that lets you easily create *beautiful* code blocks for
your Typst documents. It uses the newly added [ ` raw.line `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/raw/#definitions-line) function to
work across all languages easily. You can customize the icons, colors, and
more to suit your documentâs theme. By default it has zebra striping, line
numbers, for ease of reading.

A full set of documentation can be found [ in the repo
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dherse/codly/main/docs.pdf) .

![Example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/codly/1.0.0/demo.png)



    #import "@preview/codly:1.0.0": *
    #show: codly-init.with()

    #codly(
      languages: (
        rust: (
          name: "Rust",
          icon: text(font: "tabler-icons", "\u{fa53}),
          color: rgb("#CE412B")
        ),
      )
    )

    ```rust
    pub fn main() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }
    ```


===  Setup

To start using codly, you need to initialize codly using a show rule:



    #show: codly-init.with()


> [!TIP] You only need to do this once at the top of your document!

Then you _can_ to configure codly with your parameters:



    #codly(
      languages: (
        rust: (name: "Rust", icon: "\u{fa53}", color: rgb("#CE412B")),
      )
    )


> [!IMPORTANT] Any parameter that you leave blank will use the previous values
> (or the default value if never set) similar to a ` set ` rule in regular
> typst. But the changes are always global unless you use the provided `
> codly.local ` function. To get a full list of all settings, see the [
> documentation
> ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dherse/codly/main/docs.pdf) .

Then you just need to add a code block and it will be automatically displayed
correctly:



    ```rust
    pub fn main() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }
    ```


===  Disabling

To locally disable codly, you can just do the following, you can then later
re-enable it using the ` codly ` configuration function.



    #disable-codly()


Alternatively, you can use the ` no-codly ` function to achieve the same
effect locally:



    #no-codly[
      ```typ
      I will be displayed using the normal raw blocks.
      ```
    ]


===  Setting an offset

If you wish to add an offset to your code block, but without selecting a
subset of lines, you can use the ` codly-offset ` function:



    // Sets a 5 line offset
    #codly-offset(5)


===  Selecting a subset of lines

If you wish to select a subset of lines, you can use the ` codly-range `
function. By setting the start to 1 and the end to ` none ` you can select all
lines from the start to the end of the code block.



    #codly-range(start: 5, end: 10)


===  Adding a âskipâ

You can add a âfakeâ skip between lines using the ` skips ` parameters:



    // Before the 5th line (indexing start at 0), insert a 32 line jump.
    #codly(skips: ((4, 32), ))


This can be customized using the ` skip-line ` and ` skip-number ` to
customize what it looks like.

===  Adding annotations

> [!IMPORTANT] This is a Beta feature and has a few quirks, refer to [ the
> documentation
> ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dherse/codly/main/docs.pdf) for those

You can annotate a line/group of lines using the ` annotations ` parameters :



    // Add an annotation from the second line (0 indexing) to the 5th line included.
    #codly(
      annotations: (
        (
          start: 1,
          end: 4,
          content: block(
            width: 2em,
            // Rotate the element to make it look nice
            rotate(
              -90deg,
              align(center, box(width: 100pt)[Function body])
            )
          )
        ),
      )
    )


===  Disabling line numbers

You can configure this with the ` codly ` function:



    #codly(number-format: none)


===  Disabling zebra striping

You disable zebra striping by setting the ` zebra-fill ` to white.



    #codly(zebra-fill: none)


===  Customize the stroke

You can customize the stroke surrounding the figure using the ` stroke `
parameter of the ` codly ` function:



    #codly(stroke: 1pt + red)


===  Misc

You can also disable the icon, by setting the ` display-icon ` parameter to `
false ` :



    #codly(display-icon: false)


Same with the name, whether the block is breakable, the radius, the padding,
and the width of the numbers columns, and so many more [ documentation

= *untypsignia.md*

=  untypsignia

0.1.1

Unofficial typesetter's insignia emulations

The ` untypsignia ` is a 3rd-party, unofficial, unendorsed Typst package that
exposes commands for rendering, as ` content ` texts, some typesetters names
in a stylized fashion, emulating their respective _insignia_ , i.e., marks by
which they are known.

==  Name

The package name is a blend of:

  - âunâ, from âunofficialâ,
  - âtypâ, from âTypstâ, and
  - âsigniaâ, from âinsigniaâ, which means marks by which anything is known.

==  Description

The typical use case of ` untypsignia ` in Typst is to emulate a given
typesetting systemâs mark, if available, when referring to them, in
sentences like: âThis document is typeset in ` XYZ ` â, as traditionally
done in ` TeX ` systems and derivatives thereof.

Currently available insignia emulations include:

  - ` TeX ` ,
  - ` LaTeX ` , and
  - ` Typst ` (see below)

Despite thereâs no such a thing as a Typst âofficialâ typography,
according to this post on [ Discord
](https://discord.com/channels/1054443721975922748/1054443722592497796/1107039477714665522)
, it can be typeset with âwhatever fontâ the surrounding text is being
typeset. Moreover, Typst [ branding page ](https://typst.app/legal/brand/)
requires capitalization of the initial âTâ whenever the name is used in
prose. Therefore, the âTypstâ support in this package is a mere, still
unofficial, implementation of the capitalization of âTypstâ in the
currently used font.

==  Font Requirements

For the ` TeX ` system and itâs derivatives, the ` "New Computer Modern" `
font is required.

==  Usage

The package exposes the following few, parameterless, functions:

  - ` #texmark() ` ,
  - ` #latexmark() ` , and
  - ` #typstmark() ` .

Except for the ` #typstmark() ` , each such command outputs their respective
namesake signus emulation, in the documentâs current ` text ` settings, with
the exception of font â meaning text size, color, etcâ¦ will apply to the
signus emulation.

Aditionally, the signus emulation is produced, as ` contexts ` text inside a `
box ` â hence not images â so as to avoid hyphenation to take place. This
also applies to the ` #typstmark() ` function, for lack of specific guidance,
and also because âTypstâ is a short word.

==  Example



    #set page(width: auto, height: auto, margin: 12pt, fill: rgb("19181f"))
    #set par(leading: 1.5em)
    #set text(font: "Rouge Script", fill: rgb("80f4b6"))

    #import "@preview/untypsignia:0.1.1": *

    #let say() = [I prefer #typstmark() over #texmark() or #latexmark().]

    #for sz in (20, 16, 14, 12, 10, 8) {
      set text(size: sz * 1pt)
      say()
      linebreak()
    }


This example results in a 1-page document like this one:

= *oasis-align.md*

=  oasis-align

0.1.0

Cleanly place content side by side with equal heights using automatic content
sizing.

` oasis-align ` is a package that automatically sizes your content so that
their heights are equal, allowing you to cleanly place content side by side.

To use ` oasis-align ` in your document, start by importing the package like
this:



    #import "@preview/oasis-align:0.1.0": *


This will give you access to the two functions found under [ configurations
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oasis-
align/0.1.0/#configuration) .

==  Image with Text

![Animation of image being aligned with
text](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oasis-
align/0.1.0/examples/image-with-text.gif)

==  Image with Image

![Animation of image being aligned with another
image](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oasis-
align/0.1.0/examples/image-with-image.gif)

==  Text with Text

![Animation of text being aligned with differently sized
text](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oasis-
align/0.1.0/examples/text-with-text.gif)

There are two functions associated with this package. The first is
specifically targeted at [ aligning images
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oasis-
align/0.1.0/#oasis-align-images) , and the second is targeted at [ content in
general ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oasis-
align/0.1.0/#oasis-align-1) .

> [!important] To change the size of the gutter in both functions, use ` #set
> grid(column-gutter: length) ` . This is necessary to allow for fixed rules
> that arenât possible with user-defined functions.

==  ` oasis-align-images `

Use this function to align two images.



    #oasis-align-images(
        "path/to/image1",
        "path/to/image2"
    )


> [!tip] Whenever aligning *only* images, itâs best to use this function
> instead of the default ` oasis-align ` . _To learn more about why, check
> out[ how it works
> ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oasis-
> align/0.1.0/#how-it-works) . _

==  ` oasis-align `

Use this function to align content like text with other content like images or
figures.

> [!tip] The parameters with defined values are the defaults and do not need
> to be included unless desired.


    #oasis-align(
      int-frac: 0.5,        // decimal between 0 and 1
      tolerance: 0.001pt,   // length
      max-iterations: 50,   // integer greater than 0
      int-dir: 1,           // 1 or -1
      debug: false          // boolean
      item1,                // content
      item2,                // content
    )


===  ` int-frac `

The starting point of the search process. Changing this value may reduce the
total number of iterations of the function or find an [ alternate solution
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oasis-
align/0.1.0/#oasis-align-2) .

===  ` tolerance `

The allowable difference in heights between ` item1 ` and ` item2 ` . The
function will run until it has reached either this ` tolerance ` or ` max-
iterations ` . Making ` tolerance ` larger may reduce the total number of
iterations but result in a larger height difference between pieces of content.

> [!note] Two pieces of content may not always be able to achieve the desired
> ` tolerance ` . In that case, the function sizes the content to the
> iteration that had the least difference in height. _Check out[ how it works
> ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oasis-
> align/0.1.0/#oasis-align-2) to understand why the function may not be able
> achieve the desired ` tolerance ` . _

===  ` max-iterations `

The maximum number of iterations the function is allowed to attempt before
terminating. Increasing this number may allow you to achieve a smaller `
tolerance ` .

===  ` int-dir `

The initial direction that the dividing fraction is moved. Changing this value
will change the initial direction.

> [!note] The program is hardcoded to switch directions if a solution is not
> found in the initial direction. This parameter mainly serves to let you
> easily choose between [ multiple solutions
> ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oasis-
> align/0.1.0/#oasis-align-2) .

===  ` debug `

A toggle that lets you look inside the function to see what is happening. This
is useful if you would like to understand why certain content may be
incompatible and which of the parameters above could be changed to resolve the
issue.

==  ` oasis-align-images `

The function begins by determining the width and height of the selected
images. These values can then be used to solve a set of linear equations, the
first of which states that the sum of the widths of the images (plus the
gutter) should be equal to the available horizontal space, and the second
which states that their heights should be equal.

If $w_1$ and $h_1$ are the width and height of ` image1 ` and $w_2$ and $h_2$
are the width and height of ` image2 ` , then the final width $w_1â$ of `
image1 ` and the final width $w_2â$ of ` image2 ` are

$$w_1â = \left(\frac{h_1 w_2}{w_1 h_2} + 1 \right)^{-1} \qquad w_2â =
\left(\frac{w_1 h_2}{h_1 w_2} + 1 \right)^{-1}$$

==  ` oasis-align `

Originally designed to allow for an image to be placed side-by-side with text,
this function takes an iterative approach to aligning the content. When
changing the width of a block of text, the height does not scale linearly, but
instead behaves as a step function that follows an exponential trend (the
graph below has a simplified visualization of this). This prevents the use of
an analytical methodology similar to the one used in ` oasis-align-images ` ,
and thus must be solved using an iterative approach.

The function starts by taking the available space and then splitting it using
the ` int-frac ` . The content is then placed in a block with the width as
determined using the split from ` int-frac ` before measuring its height.
Based on the ` int-dir ` , the split will be moved left or right using the
bisection method until a solution within the ` tolerance ` has been found. In
the case that a solution within the ` tolerance ` is not found with the ` max-
iterations ` , the program terminates and uses the container width fraction
that had the smallest difference in height.

![Series of graphs visualizing the block width versus height of
content](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oasis-
align/0.1.0/examples/graph-visualization.svg)

===  Multiple Solutions (1st Graph)

Depending on the type of content, the function may find multiple solutions.
The parameters ` int-dir ` and ` int-frac ` will allow you to choose between
them by changing the direction in which it iterates and changing the starting
container width fraction respectively.

===  No Solutions (2nd Graph)

There are cases in which the text size is incompatible with an image. This can
be because there is not enough or too much text, and regardless of how the
content is resized, their heights do not match.

===  Tolerance Not Reached (3rd Graph)

In the case of having texts of different sizes (as seen in [ the examples
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oasis-
align/0.1.0/#text-with-text) ), the spacing between lines prevents the
function from finding a solution that meets the ` tolerance ` , and thus the
closest solution is used.

= *super-suboptimal.md*

=  super-suboptimal

0.1.0

Unicode super- and subscripts in equations.

A Typst package enabling support for Unicode super- and subscript characters
in equations.

==  Usage

The package exposes the template-function ` super-subscripts ` . It affects
all ` math.equation ` s by attaching every superscript- and subscript-
character to the first non-space-element on its left.



    #import "@preview/super-suboptimal:0.1.0": *
    #show: super-subscripts

    For all $(x,y)ââÂ²$:
    $
      q := norm((x,y))â < 1
      ==> âáµ¢âââ¿ q â± < â
    $


![Rendering of above
code](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/super-
suboptimal/0.1.0/assets/example0.svg)

Because code like ` $x+yá¶»$ ` throws an âunknown variableâ error, the
package also exposes the function ` eq ` , which inserts spaces before every
superscript- and subscript-character and passing it on to ` math.equation ` .
This comes at the cost of missing syntax-highlighting and code-suggestions in
your IDE.

` eq ` accepts a ` raw ` string as a positional parameter, and an argument-
sink thatâs passed onto ` math.equation ` . Unless specified otherwise in
the argument-sink, the resulting equation is typeset with ` block: true ` if
and only if the ` raw ` also satisfied ` block: true ` . ` eq ` is
automatically applied to every ` raw ` with ` lang: "eq" ` .



    #eq(`0 = aáµ`)

    #eq(```
      1 = x+yá¶»
    ```)

    #eq(`2 = aáµ`, block: true, numbering: "(1)")

    ```eq
      3 = aáµá¶âºáµâââ½á¶ â»áµâ¾âáµ¢
    ```


![Rendering of above
code](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/super-
suboptimal/0.1.0/assets/example1.svg)

Sometimes in mathematical writing, variables are decorated with an asterisk,
e.g. ` $x^_$ ` . The character ` ê³ ` can now be used, as well: ` $xê³ =
x^_$ ` .

==  Known issues

  - As mentioned above, ` $aáµ$ ` leads to an âunknown variableâ error. As a workaround, ` $a áµ$ ` produces the same output, or you can use the ` eq ` function described above.

    - The first workaround also means I canât reasonably implement top-left and bottom-left attachments. For example, ` $a Â³b$ ` is rendered like ` $attach(a, t: 3) b$ ` , rather than ` $a attach(b, tl: 3)$ ` .
  - Multiple attachments are concatenated into one content without another pass of ` equation ` . For example, ` #eq(`0Ë¢â±â¿â½áµâ¾`) ` is equivalent to ` $0^(s i n "(" k ")")$ ` , rather than ` $0^sin(k)$ ` . I wonât fix this, because:

    - Another pass of ` equation ` would cause performance issues at best, and infinite loops at worst.
    - If this were fixed, code such as ` $e Ë£ Ê¸$ ` would undesirably produce an âunknown variable ` xy ` â error.
  - Letâs call a piece of content âsmallâ if it consists of only a single non-separated sequence of characters in Typst (internally, this is the distinction between the content-functions ` sequence ` and ` text ` ). For instance, ` $1234$ ` and ` $a$ ` constitute âsmallâ content, but ` $a b$ ` and ` $3a$ ` and ` $1+2+3+4+5$ ` do not.

This package only runs on non-âsmallâ pieces of content. For example, `
$sqrt(35Â²)$ ` still renders with the default-Unicode-character and will look
different from ` $sqrt(35^2)$ ` . On the other hand, ` $sqrt(aâ¶)$ ` _is_
rendered correctly. This is because ` 35Â² ` constitutes âsmallâ content,
but ` aâ¶ ` does not.

A workaround is implemented for âsmallâ content immediately within an
equation, i.e. not nested within another content-function. For example, `
$7Â²$ ` renders the same as ` $7^2$ ` , even though itâs âsmallâ
content.

  - Equations within other content-elements might trigger multiple show-rule-passes, possibly causing performance-issues.

which yields:
![The structogram specified by the code
above](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genericusername3/structogrammer/master/examples/merge-
sort.svg)

If ` text.lang ` is set to another language, this package will try to match
inserted text to it. Currently, only ` "en" ` and ` "de" ` are supported

==  Advanced usage

` structogram() ` takes the following named arguments:

  - ` columns ` : If you already allocated wide and narrow columns, ` to-elements ` can use them. Useful for sub-specs, as youâd usually generate allocations first and then do another recursive pass to fill them.
The default, ` auto ` does exactly this on the highest recursion level.

  - ` stroke ` : The stroke to use between cells, or for control blocks. Note: to avoid duplicate strokes, every cell only adds strokes to its top and left side. Put the resulting cells in a container with bottom and right strokes for a finished diagram. See ` structogram() ` .
Default: ` 0.5pt + black `

  - ` inset ` : How much to pad each cell.
Default: ` 0.5em `

  - ` segment-height ` : How high each row should be.
Default: ` 2em `

  - ` narrow-width ` : The width that narrow columns will be. Needed for diagonals in conditional blocks.
Default: 1em

A ` spec ` (the positional argument to ` structogram() ` ) can be one of the
following:

  - ` none ` or an emtpy [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) ` () ` : An empty cell, taking up at least a narrow column
  - a [ ` string ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) : A cell containing that string or content, taking up at least a wide column
  - A [ ` dictionary ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/) : Control block ( [ see below ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/structogrammer/0.1.1/#control-blocks) )
  - An [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) of specs: The cells that each element produced, stacked on top of each other. Wide columns are aligned to wide columns of other element specs and narrow columns consumed as needed.

===  Control blocks

Specs can contain the following control blocks, as dictionaries:

====  1\. ` If ` / ` Then ` / ` Else ` :

A conditional with the following keys:

  - ` If ` : The condition on which to branch
  - ` Then ` : A diagram spec for the âyesâ-branch
  - ` Else ` : A diagram spec for the ânoâ-branch

` Then ` and ` Else ` are both optional, but at least one must be present

Examples:

  - ` (If: "debug mode", Then: ("print debug message")) ` ![Structogram with an if-branch that prints a debug message if the condition debug mode is met](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genericusername3/structogrammer/master/examples/if-then.svg)
  - ` (If: "x > 5", Then: ("x = x - 1", "print x"), Else: "print x") ` ![Structogram with an if-branch that decrements and prints x if x is smaller than 5 or else just prints x](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genericusername3/structogrammer/master/examples/if-then-else.svg)

Columns: Takes up columns according to its contents next to one another,
inserting narrow columns for empty branches

====  2\. ` For ` / ` Do ` , ` For ` / ` To ` / ` Do ` , ` For ` / ` In ` / `
Do ` , ` While ` / ` Do ` , ` Do ` / ` While ` :

A loop, with the loop control either at the top or bottom.

  - ` For ` / ` Do ` formats the control as âFor $Forâ,
  - ` For ` / ` To ` / ` Do ` as âFor $For to $Toâ,
  - ` For ` / ` In ` / ` Do ` as âFor each $For in $Inâ,
  - ` While ` / ` Do ` and ` Do ` / ` While ` as âWhile $Whileâ.

Order of specified keys matters.

Examples:

  - ` (While: "true", Do: "print \"endless loop\"") ` ![Structogram that prints "endless loop" forever \(while condition true\). This is an entry-controlled loop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genericusername3/structogrammer/master/examples/while-do.svg)
  - ` (Do: "print \"endless loop\"", While: "true") ` ![Structogram that does the same but with an exit-controlled loop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genericusername3/structogrammer/master/examples/do-while.svg)
  - ` (For: "item", In: "Container", Do: "print item.name") ` ![Structogram that iterates over each item in a container and prints the item name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genericusername3/structogrammer/master/examples/for-in.svg)

Columns: Inserts a narrow column left to its content.

====  3\. Method call ( ` Call ` )

A block indicating that a subroutine is executed here. Only accepts the key `
Call ` , which is the string name

Example:

  - ` (Call: "func()") ` ![Structogram that calls the "func" function](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genericusername3/structogrammer/master/examples/call.svg)

Columns: One wide column

====  4\. Break/Return ( ` Break ` )

A block indicating that a subroutine is executed here. Only accepts the key `
Break ` , which is the target to break to

Examples:

  - ` (Break: "") ` ![Structogram that indicates interrupting the control flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genericusername3/structogrammer/master/examples/break.svg)
  - ` (Break: "to enclosing loop") ` ![Structogram that indicates interrupting the control flow, returning to the enclosing loop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genericusername3/structogrammer/master/examples/break-to.svg)

Columns: One wide column

2.0.3

Colorful and customizable boxes for Typst

Featured  Package

*Showybox* is a Typst package for creating colorful and customizable boxes.

==  Usage

To use this library through the Typst package manager (for Typst 0.6.0 or
greater), write ` #import "@preview/showybox:2.0.2": showybox ` at the
beginning of your Typst file.

Once imported, you can create an empty showybox by using the function `
showybox() ` and giving a default body content inside the parenthesis or
outside them using squared brackets ` [] ` .

By default a ` showybox ` with these properties will be created:

  - No title
  - No shadow
  - Not breakable
  - Black borders
  - White background
  - ` 5pt ` of border radius
  - ` 1pt ` of border thickness



    #import "@preview/showybox:2.0.3": showybox

    #showybox(
      [Hello world!]
    )


===  ![Hello world!
example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/showybox/2.0.3/assets/hello-
world.png)

Looks quite simple, but the âmagicâ starts when adding a title, color and
shadows. The following code creates two âuniqueâ boxes with defined colors
and custom borders:



    // First showybox
    #showybox(
      frame: (
        border-color: red.darken(50%),
        title-color: red.lighten(60%),
        body-color: red.lighten(80%)
      ),
      title-style: (
        color: black,
        weight: "regular",
        align: center
      ),
      shadow: (
        offset: 3pt,
      ),
      title: "Red-ish showybox with separated sections!",
      lorem(20),
      lorem(12)
    )

    // Second showybox
    #showybox(
      frame: (
        dash: "dashed",
        border-color: red.darken(40%)
      ),
      body-style: (
        align: center
      ),
      sep: (
        dash: "dashed"
      ),
      shadow: (
    	  offset: (x: 2pt, y: 3pt),
        color: yellow.lighten(70%)
      ),
      [This is an important message!],
      [Be careful outside. There are dangerous bananas!]
    )

==  Changelog

===  Version 2.0.3

  - Revert fix breakable box empty before new page. Layout didnât converge

===  Version 2.0.2

  - Remove deprecated functions in Typst 0.12.0
  - Fix breakable box empty before new page

===  Version 2.0.1

  - Fix bad behaviours of boxed-titles ` anchor ` inside a ` figure `
  - Fix wrong ` breakable ` behaviour of showyboxes inside a ` figure `
  - Fix Manual and READMEâs Stokes theorem example

===  Version 2.0.0

_Special thanks to Andrew Voynov ([ https://github.com/Andrew15-5
](https://github.com/Andrew15-5) ) for the feedback while creating the new
behaviours for boxed-titles _

  - Update ` type() ` conditionals to Typst 0.8.0 standards
  - Add ` boxed-style ` property, with ` anchor ` , ` offset ` and ` radius ` properties.
  - Refactor ` showy-inset() ` for being general-purpose. Now itâs called ` showy-value-in-direction() ` and has a default value for handling properties defaults
  - Now sharp corners can be set by giving a dictionary to frame ` radius ` (e.g. ` radius: (top: 5pt, bottom: 0pt) ` ). Before this only was possible for untitled showyboxes.
  - Refactor shadow functions to be in a separated file.
  - Fix bug of bad behaviour while writing too long titles.
  - Fix bug while rendering separators with custom thickness. Now the thickness is gotten properly.
  - Fix bad shadow drawing in showyboxes with a boxed-title that has a âextremeâ ` offset ` value.
  - Fix bad sizing while creating showyboxes with a ` width ` of less than ` 100% ` , and a shadow.

===  Version 1.1.0

  - Added ` boxed ` option in title styles
  - Added ` boxed-align ` in title styles
  - Added ` sep-thickness ` for title and footer
  - Refactored repositoryâs files layout

===  Version 1.0.0

  - Fixed shadow displacement
    - *Details:* Instead of displacing the showyboxâs body from the shadow, now the shadow is displaced from the body.

_Changes below were performed by Jonas Neugebauer ([ https://github.com/jneug
](https://github.com/jneug) ) _

  - Added ` title-inset ` , ` body-inset ` , ` footer-inset ` and ` inset ` options
    - *Details:* ` title-inset ` , ` body-inset ` and ` footer-inset ` will set the inset of the title, body and footer area respectively. ` inset ` is a fallback for those areas.
  - Added a ` sep.gutter ` option to set the spacing around separator lines
  - Added option ` width ` to set the width of a showybox
  - Added option ` align ` to move a showybox with ` width ` < 100% along the x-axis
    - *Details:* A showybox is now wrapped in another block to allow alignment. This also makes it possible to pass the spacing options ` spacing ` , ` above ` and ` below ` to ` #showybox() ` .
  - Added ` footer ` and ` footer-style ` options
    - *Details:* The optional footer is added at the bottom of the box.

===  Version 0.2.1

_All changes listed here were performed by Jonas Neugebauer ([
https://github.com/jneug ](https://github.com/jneug) ) _

  - Added the ` shadow ` option
  - Enabled auto-break ( ` breakable ` ) functionality for titled showyboxes
  - Removed a thin line that appears in showyboxes with no borders or dashed borders

===  Version 0.2.0

  - Improved code documentation
  - Enabled an auto-break functionality for non-titled showyboxes
  - Created a separator functionality to separate content inside a showybox with a horizontal line

===  Version 0.1.1

  - Changed package name from colorbox to showybox
  - Fixed a spacing bug in encapsulated showyboxes
    - *Details:* When a showybox was encapsulated inside another, the spacing after that showybox was ` 0pt ` , probably due to some âfixesâ improved to manage default spacing between ` rect ` elements. The issue was solved by avoiding ` #set ` statements and adding a ` #v(-1.1em) ` to correct extra spacing between the title ` rect ` and the body ` rect ` .

===  Version 0.1.0

    #import "@preview/physica:0.9.3"

    $ physica.curl (physica.grad f), physica.tensor(T, -mu, +nu), physica.pdv(f,x,y,[1,2]) $


===  Without ` typst ` package management

Similar to examples above, but import with the undecorated file path like `
"physica.typ" ` .

==  Typst version

The version requirement for the compiler is in [ typst.toml
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/physica/0.9.3/typst.toml)
âs ` compiler ` field. If you are using an unsupported Typst version, the
compiler will throw an error. You may want to update your compiler with `
typst update ` , or choose an earlier version of the ` physica ` package.

Developed with compiler version:



    $ typst --version
    typst 0.10.0 (70ca0d25)


==  Manual

See the [ manual ](https://github.com/Leedehai/typst-
physics/blob/v0.9.3/physica-manual.pdf) for a more comprehensive coverage, a
PDF file generated directly with the [ Typst ](https://typst.app/) binary.

To regenerate the manual, use command



    typst watch physica-manual.typ


==  Contribution

  - Bug fixes are welcome!

  - New features: welcome as well. If it is small, feel free to create a pull request. If it is large, the best first step is creating an issue and let us explore the design together. Some features might warrant a package on its own.

  - Testing: currently testing is done by closely inspecting the generated [ manual ](https://github.com/Leedehai/typst-physics/blob/v0.9.3/physica-manual.pdf) . This does not scale well. I plan to add programmatic testing by comparing rendered pictures with golden images.

= *koma-labeling.md*

=  koma-labeling

0.1.0

This package introduces a labeling feature to Typst, inspired by the KOMA-
Script's labeling environment.

Version 0.1.0

The koma-labeling package for Typst is inspired by the labeling environment
from the KOMA-Script bundle in LaTeX. It provides a convenient way to create
labeled lists with customizable label widths and optional delimiters, making
it perfect for creating structured descriptions and lists in your Typst
documents.

==  Getting Started

To get started with koma-labeling, simply import the package in your Typst
document and use the labeling environment to create your labeled lists.



    #import "@preview/koma-labeling:0.1.0": labeling

    #labeling(
      (
        (lorem(1), lorem(10)),
        (lorem(2), lorem(20)),
        (lorem(3), lorem(30)),
      )
    )

    // or

    #labeling(
      (
        ([#lorem(1)], [#lorem(10)]),
        ([#lorem(2)], [#lorem(20)]),
        ([#lorem(3)], [#lorem(30)]),
      )
    )


Output:

![å¾ç](https://github.com/user-
attachments/assets/bf382afe-f66d-4032-9055-f46c72a2e7dd)

*Note:* Remember to terminate the list with a comma, even if only one pair
of items is passed.



    #import "@preview/koma-labeling:0.1.0": labeling

    #labeling(
      (
        (lorem(1), lorem(10)),  // Terminating the list with a comma is REQUIRED
      )
    )


==  Parameters

Although labeling is implemented using ` tables ` , its usage is similar to `
terms ` , except that it lacks the ` tight ` and ` hanging-indent `
parameters. If you have any questions about the parameters for ` labeling ` ,
you can refer to [ ` terms ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/terms/)
.



    labeling(
      separator: content,
      indent: length,
      spacing: auto length
      pairs: ((content, content))
    )


===  separator

The separator between the item and the description.

Default: ` [:#h(0.6em)] `

===  indent

The indentation of each item.

Default: ` 0pt `

===  spacing

The spacing between the items of the term list.

Default: ` auto `

===  pairs

An array of ` (item, description) ` pairs.

Example:



    #labeling(
      (
        ([key 1],[description 1]),
        ([keyword 2],[description 2]),
      )
    )

= *rfc-vibe.md*

=  rfc-vibe

0.1.0

Bring RFC language into everyday docs

Bring that RFC lingo to your everyday documents.

A [ Typst ](https://typst.app/) package that makes it easy to use the exact
keywords, boilerplate, and definitions provided by BCP 14, RFC2119, and
RFC8174. See the end of this README for an example of the output.

In the future, this package may include other RFC-related patterns which are
applicable to a wide variety of everyday documents.

==  Usage

Import the package in your Typst document:



    #import "@preview/rfc-vibe:0.1.0": *


===  Keywords

Use the keywords according to these examples:



    #must              // renders as: MUST
    #must-not          // renders as: MUST NOT
    #required          // renders as: REQUIRED
    #shall             // renders as: SHALL
    #shall-not         // renders as: SHALL NOT
    #should            // renders as: SHOULD
    #should-not        // renders as: SHOULD NOT
    #recommended       // renders as: RECOMMENDED
    #not-recommended   // renders as: NOT RECOMMENDED
    #may               // renders as: MAY
    #optional          // renders as: OPTIONAL


For the rare situation when you want the keywords included in quotation marks,
use the ` -quoted ` versions:



    #must-quoted              // renders as: "MUST"
    #must-not-quoted          // renders as: "MUST NOT"
    #required-quoted          // renders as: "REQUIRED"
    #shall-quoted             // renders as: "SHALL"
    #shall-not-quoted         // renders as: "SHALL NOT"
    #should-quoted            // renders as: "SHOULD"
    #should-not-quoted        // renders as: "SHOULD NOT"
    #recommended-quoted       // renders as: "RECOMMENDED"
    #not-recommended-quoted   // renders as: "NOT RECOMMENDED"
    #may-quoted               // renders as: "MAY"
    #optional-quoted          // renders as: "OPTIONAL"


===  Boilerplate

According to RFC8174, _authors who follow these guidelines should incorporate
a specific phrase near the beginning of their document_ . Include this
boilerplate text with:



    #rfc-keyword-boilerplate


This will render as:



    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
    "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when,
    and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.


===  Definitions

Although not required (and maybe discouraged), you can include definitions of
individual keywords in your document:



    #rfc-keyword-must-definition
    #rfc-keyword-must-not-definition
    #rfc-keyword-should-definition
    #rfc-keyword-should-not-definition
    #rfc-keyword-may-definition


Or include all keyword definitions at once with:



    #rfc-keyword-definitions

0.1.0

Slide Theme for Acadmic Presentations in Australia

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=academic-conf-pre&version=0.1.0)

==  1\. Introduction

This is a template for *academic conference presentations* . It is designed
for the use in Typst which is simplier and more user-friendly than LaTeX.

==  2\. How to use this template

themes documents are under */themes/*

examples documents are under */examples/*

if you donât want to redesign the template, just follow the typ files under
the examples.

==  3\. How it looks

The colors are entirely controllable, and I have provided three relatively
comfortable color schemes with *green* , *blue* , and *red* as the base
tones, which can be easily adjusted.

It is notable, there is a logo displayed in the center of the presentation,
and its *appearance* , *transparency* , and *position* can be fully
adjusted. Here, I use the University of Sydneyâs logo as an example.

You could see the PDFs under *examples/xxx.pdf*

= *rich-counters.md*

=  rich-counters

0.2.2

Counters which can inherit from other counters.

This package allows you to have *counters which can inherit from other
counters* .

Concretely, it implements ` rich-counter ` , which is a counter that can
_inherit_ one or more levels from another counter.

The interface is pretty much the same as the [ usual counter
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/introspection/counter/) . It provides a `
display() ` , ` get() ` , ` final() ` , ` at() ` , and a ` step() ` method. An
` update() ` method will be implemented soon.

==  Simple typical Showcase

In the following example, ` mycounter ` inherits the first level from `
heading ` (but not deeper levels).



    #import "@preview/rich-counters:0.2.2": *

    #set heading(numbering: "1.1")
    #let mycounter = rich-counter(identifier: "mycounter", inherited_levels: 1)

    // DOCUMENT

    Displaying `mycounter` here: #context (mycounter.display)()

    = First level heading

    Displaying `mycounter` here: #context (mycounter.display)()

    Stepping `mycounter` here. #(mycounter.step)()

    Displaying `mycounter` here: #context (mycounter.display)()

    = Another first level heading

    Displaying `mycounter` here: #context (mycounter.display)()

    Stepping `mycounter` here. #(mycounter.step)()

    Displaying `mycounter` here: #context (mycounter.display)()

    == Second level heading

    Displaying `mycounter` here: #context (mycounter.display)()

    Stepping `mycounter` here. #(mycounter.step)()

    Displaying `mycounter` here: #context (mycounter.display)()

    = Aaand another first level heading

    Displaying `mycounter` here: #context (mycounter.display)()

    Stepping `mycounter` here. #(mycounter.step)()

    Displaying `mycounter` here: #context (mycounter.display)()


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/rich-
counters/0.2.2/example.png)

==  Construction of a ` rich-counter `

To create a ` rich-counter ` , you have to call the ` rich-counter(...) `
function. It accepts three arguments:

  - ` identifier ` (required)

Must be a unique ` string ` which identifies the counter.

  - ` inherited_levels `

Specifies how many levels should be inherited from the parent counter.

  - ` inherited_from ` (Default: ` heading ` )

Specifies the parent counter. Can be a ` rich-counter ` or any key that is
accepted by the [ ` counter(...) ` constructor
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/introspection/counter#constructor) , such
as a ` label ` , a ` selector ` , a ` location ` , or a ` function ` like `
heading ` . If not specified, defaults to ` heading ` (and hence it will
inherit from the counter of the headings).

If itâs a ` rich-counter ` and ` inherited_levels ` is _not_ specified, then
` inherited_levels ` will default to one level higher than the given ` rich-
counter ` .

For example, the following creates a ` rich-counter ` ` foo ` which inherits
one level from the headings, and then another ` rich-counter ` ` bar ` which
inherits two levels (implicitly) from ` foo ` .



    #import "@preview/rich-counters:0.2.2": *

    #let foo = rich-counter(identifier: "foo", inherited_levels: 1)
    #let bar = rich-counter(identifier: "bar", inherited_from: foo)


==  Usage of a ` rich-counter `

  - ` display(numbering) ` (needs ` context ` )

Displays the current value of the counter with the given numbering style.
Giving the numbering style is optional, with default value ` "1.1" ` .

  - ` get() ` (needs ` context ` )

Returns the current value of the counter (as an ` array ` ).

  - ` final() ` (needs ` context ` )

Returns the value of the counter at the end of the document.

  - ` at(loc) ` (needs ` context ` )

Returns the value of the counter at ` loc ` , where ` loc ` can be a ` label `
, ` selector ` , ` location ` , or ` function ` .

  - ` step(depth: 1) `

Steps the counter at the specified ` depth ` (default: ` 1 ` ). That is, it
steps the ` rich-counter ` at level ` inherited_levels + depth ` .

*Due to a Typst limitation, you have to put parentheses before you put the
arguments. (See below.)*

For example, the following steps ` mycounter ` (at depth 1) and then displays
it.



    #import "@preview/rich-counters:0.2.2": *
    #let mycounter = rich-counter(...)

    #(mycounter.step)()
    #context (mycounter.display)("1.1")


==  Limitations

Due to current Typst limitations, there is no way to detect manual updates or
steps of Typst-native counters, like ` counter(heading).update(...) ` or `
counter(heading).step(...) ` . Only occurrences of actual ` heading ` s can be
detected. So make sure that after you call e.g. ` counter(heading).update(...)
` , you place a heading directly after it, before you call any ` rich-counter
` s.

==  Roadmap

  - implement ` update() `
  - use Typst custom types as soon as they become available
  - adopt native Typst implementation of dependent counters as soon it becomes available

===  How to add

= *rubby.md*

=  rubby

0.10.1

Add ruby (furigana) next to base text.

==  Usage



    #import "@preview/rubby:0.10.1": get-ruby

    #let ruby = get-ruby(
      size: 0.5em,         // Ruby font size
      dy: 0pt,             // Vertical offset of the ruby
      pos: top,            // Ruby position (top or bottom)
      alignment: "center", // Ruby alignment ("center", "start", "between", "around")
      delimiter: "|",      // The delimiter between words
      auto-spacing: true,  // Automatically add necessary space around words
    )

    // Ruby goes first, base text - second.
    #ruby[ãµãããª][æ¯ãä»®å]

    Treat each kanji as a separate word:
    #ruby[ã¨ã|ããã|ãã|ããã|ã ã|ãã][æ±|äº¬|å·¥|æ¥­|å¤§|å­¦]


If you donât want automatically wrap text with delimiter:



    #let ruby = get-ruby(auto-spacing: false)


See also [ https://github.com/rinmyo/ruby-typ/blob/main/manual.pdf
](https://github.com/rinmyo/ruby-typ/blob/main/manual.pdf) and ` example.typ `
.

==  Notes

Original project is at [ https://github.com/rinmyo/ruby-typ
](https://github.com/rinmyo/ruby-typ) which itself is based on [ the post
](https://zenn.dev/saito_atsushi/articles/ff9490458570e1) of é½è¤æ¦å¿
(Saito Atsushi). This project is a modified version of [ this commit
](https://github.com/rinmyo/ruby-
typ/commit/23ca86180757cf70f2b9f5851abb5ea5a3b4c6a1) .

` auto-spacing ` adds missing delimiter around the ` content ` / ` string `
which then adds space around base text if ruby is wider than the base text.

Problems appear only if ruby is wider than its base text and ` auto-spacing `
is not set to ` true ` (default is ` true ` ).

You can always use a one-letter function (variable) name to shorten the
function call length (if you have to use it a lot), e.g., ` #let r = get-
ruby() ` (or ` f ` â short for furigana). But be careful as there are
functions with names ` v ` and ` h ` and there could be a new built-in
function with a name ` r ` or ` f ` which may break your document (Typst right
now is in beta, so breaking changes are possible).

Although you can open issues or send PRs, I wonât be able to always reply
quickly (sometimes Iâm very busy).

==  Development

This repository should exist as a ` @local ` package with the version from the
` typst.toml ` .

Here is a short description of the development process:

  1. run ` git checkout dev && git pull ` ;
  2. make changes;
  3. test changes, if not done or something isnât working then go to step 1;
  4. when finished, run ` just change-version <new semantic version> ` ;
  5. document changes in the ` CHANGELOG.md ` ;
  6. commit all changes (only locally);
  7. create a ` @local ` Typst package with the new version and test it;
  8. if everything is working then run ` git push ` ;
  9. realize that youâve missed something and fix it (then push changes again);
  10. run ` git checkout master && git merge dev ` to sync ` master ` to ` dev ` ;
  11. run ` just create-release ` .

==  Publishing a Typst package

  1. To make a new package version for merging into ` typst/packages ` repository run ` just mark-PR-version ` ;
  2. copy newly created directory (with a version name) and place it in the appropriate place in your fork of the ` typst/packages ` repository;
  3. run ` git fetch upstream && git merge upstream main ` to sync fork with ` typst/packages ` ;
  4. go to a new branch with ` git checkout -b <package-version> ` ;
  5. commit newly added directory with commit message: ` package:version ` ;
  6. run ` gh pr create ` and follow further CLI instructions.

=  commute

0.2.0

A proof of concept library for commutative diagrams.

Featured  Package

Proof-of-concept commutative diagrams library for [ typst
](https://typst.app/home)

See [EricWay1024/tikzcd-editor][ [ https://github.com/EricWay1024/tikzcd-
editor ](https://github.com/EricWay1024/tikzcd-editor) ] for a web-based
visual diagram editor for this library!



    #import "@preview/commute:0.2.0": node, arr, commutative-diagram

    #align(center)[#commutative-diagram(
      node((0, 0), $X$),
      node((0, 1), $Y$),
      node((1, 0), $X \/ "ker"(f)$, "quot"),
      arr($X$, $Y$, $f$),
      arr("quot", (0, 1), $tilde(f)$, label-pos: right, "dashed", "inj"),
      arr($X$, "quot", $pi$),
    )]


![screenshot](https://github.com/typst/packages/assets/20535498/71eb8d47-b6f9-43fa-a1fd-7ff58b8d0025)

For more usage examples look at ` example.typ `

The library provides 3 functions: ` node ` , ` arr ` , and ` commutative-
diagram ` . You can clone this repo and import ` lib.typ ` :



    #import "path/to/commute/lib.typ": node, arr, commutative-diagram


Or directly use the builtin package manager:



    #import "@preview/commute:0.2.0": node, arr, commutative-diagram


==  ` commutative-diagram `



    commutative-diagram(
      node-padding: (70pt, 70pt),
      arr-clearance: 0.7em,
      padding: 1.5em,
      debug: false,
      ..entities
    )


` commutative-diagram ` returns a rectangular region containing the nodes and
arrows. All the unnamed arguments passed to ` commutative-diagram ` are
treated as nodes or arrows of the diagram. These can be constructed using the
` node ` and ` arr ` functions explained below. The other arguments are as
follows:

  - ` node-padding ` : ` (length, length) ` . The space to leave between adjacent nodes. Itâs a tuple, ` (h, v) ` , containing the horizontal and vertical spacing respectively.
  - ` arr-clearance ` : ` length ` . The default space between arrowsâ base/tip and the diagramâs nodes.
  - ` padding ` : ` length ` . The padding around the whole diagram
  - ` debug ` : ` bool ` . Whether or not to display debug information.

==  ` node `



    node(
      pos,
      label,
      id: label,
    )


Creates a new diagram node. Has the following positional arguments:

  - ` pos ` : ` (integer, integer) ` . The position of the node in ` (row, column) ` format. Must be integers, but can be negative, the only thing that counts is the difference between the coordinares of the variuos nodes in the diagram.
  - ` label ` : ` content ` . The nodeâs label.
  - ` id ` : ` any ` . The nodeâs id, defaults to its label if not specified.

==  ` arr `



    arr(
      start,
      end,
      label,
      start-space: none,
      end-space: none,
      label-pos: left,
      curve: 0deg,
      stroke: 0.45pt,
      ..options
    )


Creates an arrow. Has the following arguments:

  - ` start ` : ` (integer, integer) ` or ` any ` . The position of the node from which the arrow starts, in ` (row, column) ` format, or its id.
  - ` end ` : ` (integer, integer) ` or ` any ` . The position of the node where the arrow ends, in ` (row, column) ` format, or its id.
  - ` label ` : ` content ` . The label to put on the arrow.
  - ` start-space ` : ` length ` . The space between the start node and the beginning of the arrow. You can pass ` none ` to leave a sensible default, customizable using the ` arr-clearance ` parameter of the ` commutative-diagram ` function.
  - ` end-space ` : ` length ` . Similar to the above.
  - ` label-pos ` : ` length ` or ` left ` or ` right ` . Where to position the arrowâs label relative to the arrow. A positive length means that, when looking towards the tip of the arrow, the label is on the left. ` left ` and ` right ` measure the label to automatically get a reasonable length. If set to ` 0 ` ( ` 0 ` the number, which is different from ` 0pt ` or ` 0em ` ) then the label is placed on top of the arrow, with a white background to help with legibility.
  - ` curve ` : ` angle ` . The difference in orientation between the start and the end of the arrow. If positive, the arrow curves to the right, when looking towards the tip.
  - ` stroke ` : ` stroke ` . The thickness and color of the arrows. The default should probably be fine.
  - ` options ` : ` string ` s. After the mandatory positional arguments ` start ` , ` end ` and ` label ` , any remaining unnamed argument is treated as an extra option. Recognized options are:
    - ` "inj" ` , gives the arrow a hook at the start, used for injective functions
    - ` "surj" ` , gives the arrow a double tip, used for surjective functions
    - ` "bij" ` , gives the arrow a tip also at the start, used for bijective functions
    - ` "def" ` , gives the arrow a bar at the start, used for function definitions
    - ` "nat" ` , gives the arrow a double stem, used for natural transformations
    - All the options supported by the ` dash ` parameter of Typstâs ` stroke ` type, such as ` "dashed" ` , ` "densely-dotted" ` , etc. These change the appearance of the arrowâs stem

This is a Typst template for COMAPâs Mathematical Contest in MCM/ICM.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` mcm-scaffold ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/mcm-scaffold


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` mcm ` function with the following named arguments:

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` problem-chosen ` : The problem your team have chosen.
  - ` team-control-number ` : Your team control number.

![A preview of the bamdone-rebuttal Typst
template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/bamdone-
rebuttal-0.1.1-small.webp)

=  bamdone-rebuttal

0.1.1

Rebuttal/response letter template that allows authors to respond to feedback
given by reviewers in a peer-review process on a point-by-point basis.

Featured  Template

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=bamdone-rebuttal&version=0.1.1)

This is a Typst template for a rebuttal/response letter. It allows authors to
respond to feedback given by reviewers in a peer-review process on a point-by-
point basis. This template is based heavily on the LaTeX template from Zenke
Lab (see [ here ](https://zenkelab.org/resources/latex-rebuttal-response-to-
reviewers-template/) ).

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` bamdone-rebuttal ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/bamdone-rebuttal


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` rebuttal ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` title ` : (content), something like âResponse Letterâ (the default) or âRebuttalâ.
  - ` authors ` : (content), list of author names the top of the first column in boldface.
  - ` date ` : (content), defaults to ` datetime.today().display() `
  - ` paper-size ` : Defaults to ` us-letter ` . Specify a [ paper size string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-paper) to change the page format. Specifying this will configure numeric, IEEE-style citations.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
letter.

In addition, the template exports the ` configure ` function which accepts the
following named arguments corresponding to the text color of various pieces of
the letter:

  - ` point-color ` : defaults to ` blue.darken(30%) ` , the text color for reviewersâ points
  - ` response-color ` : defaults to ` black ` , the text color for the authorsâ responses
  - ` new-color ` : defaults to ` green.darken(30%) ` , the text color for changes/additions to the manuscript (i.e., within a ` quote ` block to show whatâs changed from the initial submission)

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` rebuttal
` function in a show rule.



    // Optional color configuration
    #let (point, response, new) = configure(
      point-color: blue.darken(30%),
      response-color: black,
      new-color: green.darken(30%)
    )

    // Setup the rebuttal
    #show: rebuttal.with(
      authors: [First A. Author and Second B. Author],
      // date: ,
      // paper-size: ,
    )

    // Your content goes below
    We thank the reviewers...

= *acrotastic.md*

=  acrotastic

0.1.1

Manage acronyms and their definitions in Typst.

Manages all your acronyms for you.

Acrotastics main features are clickable abbreviations that auto-expand on the
first occurence, manual short and long forms, implicit or manual plural form
support, and customizable index printing.

==  Quick Start



    #import "@preview/acrotastic:0.1.1": *

    #init-acronyms((
      "WTP": ("Wonderful Typst Package","Wonderful Typst Packages"),
    ))

    Acrotastic is a #acr("WTP")! This #acr("WTP") enables easy acronym manipulation.


==  Usage

===  Define acronyms

First, define the acronyms in a dictionary, with the keys being the acronyms
and the values being arrays of their definitions. If there is only a singular
version of the definition, the array contains only one value. If there are
both singular and plural versions, define the definition as an array where the
first item is the singular definition and the second item is the plural. Then,
initialize Acrotastic by passing the dictionay you just defined to the `
#init-acronyms(...) ` function.

Here is a example of the ` acronyms.typ ` file:



    #import "@preview/acrotastic:0.1.1": *

    #init-acronyms((
      "NN": ("Neural Network"),
      "OS": ("Operating System",),
      "BIOS": ("Basic Input/Output System", "Basic Input/Output Systems"),
    ))


===  Call Acrotastic functions

There is a large number of different functions to fit every use case. You will
find an overview of all functions and their descriptions in the table below.

Function  |  Description
---|---
` #acr(...) ` |  On the first occurrence the long version of the abbreviation and the abbreviation itself are displayed in brackets. The next time only the abbreviation is displayed.
` #acrpl(...) ` |  Same as ` #acr(...) ` but the plural will be diplayed. If no plural is defined, an âsâ is added to the singular form.
` #acrf(...) ` |  The acronym will be displayed as if it is the first time. This means that it is again shown in the long form and the abbreviation in brackets.
` #acrfpl(...) ` |  Same as ` #acrf(...) ` but the plural will be displayed. If no plural is defined, an âsâ is added to the singular form.
` #acrs(...) ` |  Always displays the short form of the acronym.
` #acrspl(...) ` |  Same as ` #acrs(...) ` but adds an âsâ to the acronym for the plural form.
` #acrl(...) ` |  Always displays the long form of the acronym.
` #acrlpl(...) ` |  Same as ` #acrl(...) ` but the plural will be displayed. If no plural is defined, an âsâ is added to the singular form.
` #reset-acronym(...) ` |  Resets a specific acronym. The acronym will be expanded on the next use.
` reset-all-acronyms() ` |  Resets all acronyms. The acronyms will be expanded on their next use.

You can alternatively use ` #acr(...) ` , ` #acrf(...) ` , ` #acrs(...) ` and
` #acrl(...) ` with ` plural: true ` to display the plural form.



    #acr("BIOS", plural: true)


To deactivate the link to the abbreviations directory (for whatever reason),
you can set ` link: false ` .



    #acr("BIOS", link: false)


===  Print Abbreviations directory

You can also print an index of all acronyms used in the document with the `
#print-index() ` function. There are some parameters for customization.

parameter  |  values  |  default  |  description
---|---|---|---
title  |  string  |  âList of Abbreviationsâ  |  Heading of the acronym index
level  |  number  |  1  |  Level of the heading
sorted  |  âupâ, âdownâ, âkeepâ  |  âupâ  |  âUpâ sorts alphabetically, âDownâ sorts reversed alphabetically and âkeepâ uses the order from initialization
delimiter  |  string  |  â:â  |  String to place after the acronym in the list
acr-col-size  |  percentage  |  20%  |  Size of the acronym column in percent
outlined  |  bool  |  false  |  Make the index section outlined

==  Possible Errors

Error  |  Solution
---|---
Acronym is not a key in the acronyms dictionary.  |  Make sure that the acronym is defined in the dictionary passed to ` #init-acronyms(dict) `
No definitions found for acronym. Make sure it is defined in the dictionary passed to #init-acronyms(dict)  |  The acronym is in the dictionary, but has no correct definition.
Definitions should be arrays of one or two strings. Definition of acronym is:  |  The acronym has a definition, but the definition doesnât have the right type. Make sure itâs an array of one or two strings.

Moreover you have to be careful when using states.

  - For every acronym âABCâ that you define, the state named âacronym-state-ABCâ is initialized and used. To avoid errors, do not try to use this state manually for other purposes. Similarly, the state named âacronymsâ is reserved to Acrotastic. Please avoid using it.
  - The functions above are leveraging the state ` display ` function and only works if the return value is actually printed in the document. For more information on states, see the [ Typst documentation on states ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/introspection/state/) .

= *chic-hdr.md*

=  chic-hdr

0.4.0

Typst package for creating elegant headers and footers

*Chic-header* (chic-hdr) is a Typst package for creating elegant headers and
footers

==  Usage

To use this library through the Typst package manager (for Typst 0.6.0 or
greater), write ` #import "@preview/chic-hdr:0.4.0": * ` at the beginning of
your Typst file. Once imported, you can start using the package by writing the
instruction ` #show: chic.with() ` and giving any of the chic functions inside
the parenthesis ` () ` .

_*Important: If you are using a custom template that also needs the` #show `
instruction to be applied, prefer to use ` #show: chic() ` after the
templateâs ` #show ` . * _

For example, the code belowâ¦



    #import "@preview/chic-hdr:0.4.0": *

    #set page(paper: "a7")

    #show: chic.with(
      chic-footer(
        left-side: strong(
            link("mailto:admin@chic.hdr", "admin@chic.hdr")
        ),
        right-side: chic-page-number()
      ),
      chic-header(
        left-side: emph(chic-heading-name(fill: true)),
        right-side: smallcaps("Example")
      ),
      chic-separator(1pt),
      chic-offset(7pt),
      chic-height(1.5cm)
    )

    = Introduction
    #lorem(30)

    == Details
    #lorem(70)


â¦will look like this:

===  ![Usage
example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/chic-
hdr/0.4.0/assets/usage.png)

==  Reference

_Note: For a detailed explanation of the functions and parameters, see Chic-
headerâs Manual.pdf._

While using ` #show: chic.with() ` , you can give the following parameters
inside the parenthesis:

  - ` width ` : Indicates the with of headers and footers in all the document (default is ` 100% ` ).
  - ` skip ` : Which pages must be skipped for setting its header and footer. Other properties changed with ` chic-height() ` or ` chic-offset() ` are preserved. Giving a negative index causes a skip of the last pages using last page as index -1(default is ` () ` ).
  - ` even ` : Header and footer for even pages. Here, only ` chic-header() ` , ` chic-footer() ` and ` chic-separator() ` functions will take effect. Other functions must be given as an argument of ` chic() ` .
  - ` odd ` : Sets the header and footer for odd pages. Here, only ` chic-header() ` , ` chic-footer() ` and ` chic-separator() ` functions will take effect. Other functions must be given as an argument of ` chic() ` .
  - ` ..functions() ` : These are a variable number of arguments that corresponds to Chic-headerâs style functions.

===  Functions

  1. ` chic-header() ` \- Sets the header content.
     - ` v-center ` : Whether to vertically align the header content, or not (default is ` false ` ).
     - ` side-width ` : Custom width for the sides. It can be an 3-element-array, length or relative length (default is ` none ` and widths are set to ` 1fr ` if a side is present).
     - ` left-side ` : Content displayed in the left side of the header (default is ` none ` ).
     - ` center-side ` : Content displayed in the center of the header (default is ` none ` ).
     - ` right-side ` : Content displayed in the right side of the header (default is ` none ` ).
  2. ` chic-footer() ` \- Sets the footer content.
     - ` v-center ` : Whether to vertically align the header content, or not (default is ` false ` ).
     - ` side-width ` : Custom width for the sides. It can be an 3-element-array, length or relative length (default is ` none ` and widths are set to ` 1fr ` if a side is present).
     - ` left-side ` : Content displayed in the left side of the footer (default is ` none ` ).
     - ` center-side ` : Content displayed in the center of the footer (default is ` none ` ).
     - ` right-side ` : Content displayed in the right side of the footer (default is ` none ` ).
  3. ` chic-separator() ` \- Sets the separator for either the header, the footer or both.
     - ` on ` : Where to apply the separator. It can be ` "header" ` , ` "footer" ` or ` "both" ` (default is ` "both" ` ).
     - ` outset ` : Space around the separator beyond the page margins (default is ` 0pt ` ).

= *songb.md*

=  songb

0.1.0

A songbook package, to display chords above the lyrics and show a number-based
index (similar to patacrep)

Attempt at creating a songbook package to replace [ patacrep
](https://github.com/patacrep/patacrep) (which is based on LaTeX + [ Songs
](https://songs.sourceforge.net/) ).

==  Quickstart

First, create a ` main.typ ` file, like the following:



    #set page(paper: "a6",margin: (inside: 14mm, outside: 6mm, y: 10mm))

    #import "@preview/songb:0.1.0": autobreak, index-by-letter

    // helper function, to include you own songs (feel free to customize)
    #let song(path) = {
        // WARNING: autobreak is currently broken (does not converge)
        // see https://github.com/typst/typst/discussions/4530
        autobreak(include path)
        v(-1.19em)
    }

    // indexes (put them wherever you want, or comment them out)
    = Song Index
    #index-by-letter(<song>)

    = Singer Index
    #index-by-letter(<singer>)

    #pagebreak()

    // include all you songs, in the right order
    #song("./songs/first_song.typ")

    #song("./songs/other_song.typ")

    // ...


Then, create your song files, like ` songs/first_song.typ ` :



    #import "@preview/songb:0.1.0": song, chorus, verse, chord

    #show: doc => song(
      title: "First Song",
      singer: "Sing",
      doc,
    )

    #chorus[
      #chord[Am]First line,#chord[G][ ]of the chorus\
      #chord[Am]Second line,#chord[G][ ]of the chorus.
    ]


    #verse[
      #chord[Em]First verse\
      With multiple\
      #chord[C]Lines
    ]

    If there is #chord[D][a] bridge\
    you can write it directly


==  Writing a song

===  song



    #let song(
      title: none,
      title-index: none,
      singer: none,
      singer-index: none,
      references: (),
      line-color: rgb(0xd0, 0xd0, 0xd0),
      header-display: (number, title, singer) => (...),
      doc
    )


===  chord



    // first argument: chord name
    // optional second argument: text below the chord (useful for whitespace for instance)
    #let chord(..content)


===  verse



    #let verse(body)


===  chorus



    #let chorus(body)


==  Organizing songs

===  autobreak

> [!WARNING] Currently broken (lack of convergence for bigger documents) See [
> https://github.com/typst/typst/discussions/4530
> ](https://github.com/typst/typst/discussions/4530)

This function aims at putting the content on a single page (or on facing
pages), by introducing pagebreaks when needed.



    #let autobreak(content)


===  index-by-letter



    #let index-by-letter(label, letter-highlight: (letter) => (...))


label: ` <song> ` or ` <singer> ` are provided by the ` song ` function.

===  How to add

= *algo.md*

=  algo

0.3.4

Beautifully typeset algorithms.

A Typst library for writing algorithms. On Typst v0.6.0+ you can import the `
algo ` package:



    #import "@preview/algo:0.3.4": algo, i, d, comment, code


Otherwise, add the ` algo.typ ` file to your project and import it as normal:



    #import "algo.typ": algo, i, d, comment, code


Use the ` algo ` function for writing pseudocode and the ` code ` function for
writing code blocks with line numbers. Check out the [ examples
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/algo/0.3.4/#examples)
below for a quick overview. See the [ usage
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/algo/0.3.4/#usage)
section to read about all the options each function has.

==  Examples

Hereâs a basic use of ` algo ` :



    #algo(
      title: "Fib",
      parameters: ("n",)
    )[
      if $n < 0$:#i\        // use #i to indent the following lines
        return null#d\      // use #d to dedent the following lines
      if $n = 0$ or $n = 1$:#i #comment[you can also]\
        return $n$#d #comment[add comments!]\
      return #smallcaps("Fib")$(n-1) +$ #smallcaps("Fib")$(n-2)$
    ]

Hereâs a use of ` algo ` without a title, parameters, line numbers, or
syntax highlighting:



    #algo(
      line-numbers: false,
      strong-keywords: false
    )[
      if $n < 0$:#i\
        return null#d\
      if $n = 0$ or $n = 1$:#i\
        return $n$#d\
      \
      let $x <- 0$\
      let $y <- 1$\
      for $i <- 2$ to $n-1$:#i #comment[so dynamic!]\
        let $z <- x+y$\
        $x <- y$\
        $y <- z$#d\
        \
      return $x+y$
    ]

      fill: rgb(98%, 98%, 98%),
      stroke: 1pt + rgb(50%, 50%, 50%),
      radius: 0pt,
      breakable: false,
      block-align: center,
      main-text-styles: (:),
      comment-styles: (fill: rgb(45%, 45%, 45%)),
      line-number-styles: (:)
    )


*Parameters:*

  - ` body ` : ` content ` â Main algorithm content.

  - ` header ` : ` content ` â Algorithm header. If specified, ` title ` and ` parameters ` are ignored.

  - ` title ` : ` string ` or ` content ` â Algorithm title. Ignored if ` header ` is specified.

  - ` Parameters ` : ` array ` â List of algorithm parameters. Elements can be ` string ` or ` content ` values. ` string ` values will automatically be displayed in math mode. Ignored if ` header ` is specified.

  - ` line-numbers ` : ` boolean ` â Whether to display line numbers.

  - ` strong-keywords ` : ` boolean ` â Whether to strongly emphasize keywords.

  - ` keywords ` : ` array ` â List of terms to receive strong emphasis. Elements must be ` string ` values. Ignored if ` strong-keywords ` is ` false ` .

The default list of keywords is stored in ` _algo-default-keywords ` . This
list contains the following terms:


        ("if", "else", "then", "while", "for",
    "repeat", "do", "until", ":", "end",
    "and", "or", "not", "in", "to",
    "down", "let", "return", "goto")


Note that for each of the above terms, ` _algo-default-keywords ` also
contains the uppercase form of the term (e.g. âforâ and âForâ).

  - ` comment-prefix ` : ` content ` â What to prepend comments with.

  - ` indent-size ` : ` length ` â Size of line indentations.

  - ` indent-guides ` : ` stroke ` â Stroke for indent guides.

  - ` indent-guides-offset ` : ` length ` â Horizontal offset of indent guides.

  - ` row-gutter ` : ` length ` â Space between lines.

  - ` column-gutter ` : ` length ` â Space between line numbers, text, and comments.

  - ` inset ` : ` length ` â Size of inner padding.

  - ` fill ` : ` color ` â Fill color.

  - ` stroke ` : ` stroke ` â Stroke for the elementâs border.

  - ` radius ` : ` length ` â Corner radius.

  - ` breakable ` : ` boolean ` â Whether the element can break across pages. WARNING: indent guides may look off when broken across pages.

  - ` block-align ` : ` none ` or ` alignment ` or ` 2d alignment ` â Alignment of the ` algo ` on the page. Using ` none ` will cause the internal ` block ` element to be returned as-is.

  - ` main-text-styles ` : ` dictionary ` â Styling options for the main algorithm text. Supports all parameters in Typstâs native ` text ` function.

  - ` comment-styles ` : ` dictionary ` â Styling options for comment text. Supports all parameters in Typstâs native ` text ` function.

  - ` line-number-styles ` : ` dictionary ` â Styling options for line numbers. Supports all parameters in Typstâs native ` text ` function.

===  ` i ` and ` d `

For use in an ` algo ` body. ` #i ` indents all following lines and ` #d `
dedents all following lines.

===  ` comment `

For use in an ` algo ` body. Adds a comment to the line in which itâs
placed.



    comment(
      body,
      inline: false
    )


*Parameters:*

  - ` body ` : ` content ` â Comment content.

  - ` inline ` : ` boolean ` â If true, the comment is displayed in place rather than on the right side.

NOTE: inline comments will respect both ` main-text-styles ` and ` comment-
styles ` , preferring ` comment-styles ` when the two conflict.

NOTE: to make inline comments insensitive to ` strong-keywords ` , strong
emphasis is disabled within them. This can be circumvented via the ` text `
function:


        #comment(inline: true)[#text(weight: 700)[...]]


===  ` no-emph `

For use in an ` algo ` body. Prevents the passed content from being strongly
emphasized. If a word appears in your algorithm both as a keyword and as
normal text, you may escape the non-keyword usages via this function.



    no-emph(
      body
    )


*Parameters:*

  - ` body ` : ` content ` â Content to display without emphasis.

===  ` code `

Makes a code block element.



    code(
      body,
      line-numbers: true,
      indent-guides: none,
      indent-guides-offset: 0pt,
      tab-size: auto,
      row-gutter: 10pt,
      column-gutter: 10pt,
      inset: 10pt,
      fill: rgb(98%, 98%, 98%),
      stroke: 1pt + rgb(50%, 50%, 50%),
      radius: 0pt,
      breakable: false,
      block-align: center,
      main-text-styles: (:),
      line-number-styles: (:)
    )


*Parameters:*

  - ` body ` : ` content ` â Main content. Expects ` raw ` text.

  - ` line-numbers ` : ` boolean ` â Whether to display line numbers.

template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/athena-tu-darmstadt-
thesis-0.1.0-small.webp)

=  athena-tu-darmstadt-thesis

0.1.0

Thesis template for TU Darmstadt (Technische UniversitÃ¤t Darmstadt).

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=athena-tu-darmstadt-
thesis&version=0.1.0)

This *unofficial* template can be used to write in [ Typst
](https://github.com/typst/typst) with the corporate design of [ TU Darmstadt
](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/) .

====  Disclaimer

Please ask your supervisor if you are allowed to use typst and this template
for your thesis or other documents. Note that this template is not checked by
TU Darmstadt for correctness. Thus, this template does not guarantee
completeness or correctness. Also, note that submission in TUbama requires
PDF/A which typst currently canât export to ( [
https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2942
](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2942) ). You can use a converter to
convert from the typst output to PDF/A, but check that there are no losses
during the conversion. CMYK color space support may be required for printing
which is also currently not supported by typst ( [
https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2942
](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2942) ), but this is not relevant when
you just submit online.

==  Implemented Templates

The templates imitate the style of the corresponding latex templates in [
tuda_latex_templates ](https://github.com/tudace/tuda_latex_templates) . Note
that there can be visual differences between the original latex template and
the typst template (you may open an issue when you find one).

For missing features, ideas or other problems you can just open an issue
:wink:. Contributions are also welcome.

[ example_tudapub.typ ](https://github.com/JeyRunner/tuda-typst-templates/blob/main/example_tudapub.typ) |  Master and Bachelor thesis

==  Usage

Create a new typst project based on this template locally.



    typst init @preview/athena-tu-darmstadt-thesis
    cd athena-tu-darmstadt-thesis


Or create a project on the typst web app based on this template.

Or do a manual installation of this template.  For a manual setup create a
folder for your writing project and download this template into the
`templates` folder:



    mkdir my_thesis && cd my_thesis
    mkdir templates && cd templates
    git clone https://github.com/JeyRunner/tuda-typst-templates templates/


===  Logo and Font Setup

Download the tud logo from [ download.hrz.tu-
darmstadt.de/protected/ULB/tuda_logo.pdf ](https://download.hrz.tu-
darmstadt.de/protected/ULB/tuda_logo.pdf) and put it into the ` logos `
folder. Now execute the following script in the ` logos ` folder to convert it
into an svg:



    cd logos
    ./convert_logo.sh


Also download the required fonts ` Roboto ` and ` XCharter ` :



    cd fonts
    ./download_fonts.sh


Now you can install all fonts in the folders in ` fonts ` on your system.

Create a main.typ file for the manual template installation.  Create a simple
`main.typ` in the root folder (`my_thesis`) of your new project:



    #import " templates/tuda-typst-templates/templates/tudapub/tudapub.typ": tudapub

    #show: tudapub.with(
      title: [
        My Thesis
      ],
      author: "My Name",
      accentcolor: "3d"
    )

    = My First Chapter
    Some Text


===  Compile you typst file



    typst --watch main.typ --font-path fonts/


This will watch your file and recompile it to a pdf when the file is saved.
For writing, you can use [ Vscode ](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with these
extensions: [ Typst LSP
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nvarner.typst-lsp) and [
Typst Preview
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgt19937.typst-preview)
. Or use the [ typst web app ](https://typst.app/) (here you need to upload
the logo and the fonts).

Note that we add ` --font-path ` to ensure that the correct fonts are used.
Due to a bug (typst/typst#2917 typst/typst#2098) typst sometimes uses the font
` Roboto condensed ` instead of ` Roboto ` . To be on the safe side, double-
check the embedded fonts in the pdf (there should be no ` Roboto condensed `
). What also works is to uninstall/deactivate all ` Roboto condensed ` fonts
from your system.

==  Todos

= *great-theorems.md*

=  great-theorems

0.1.1

Straightforward and functional theorem/proof environments.

This package allows you to make *theorem/proof/remark/â¦* blocks.

Features:

  - supports advanced counters through both [ headcount ](https://typst.app/universe/package/headcount/) and [ rich-counters ](https://typst.app/universe/package/rich-counters/)
  - easy adjustment of style:
    - change prefix
    - change how title is displayed
    - change formatting of body
    - change suffix
    - change numbering style
    - configure _all_ parameters of the [ ` block ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/block/) , including background color, stroke color, rounded corners, inset, â¦
  - can adjust style also on individual basis (e.g. to highlight main theorem)
  - works with labels/references
  - sane and smart defaults

==  Showcase

In the following example we use [ rich-counters
](https://typst.app/universe/package/rich-counters/) to configure section-
based counters. You can also use [ headcount
](https://typst.app/universe/package/headcount/) .



    #import "@preview/great-theorems:0.1.1": *
    #import "@preview/rich-counters:0.2.1": *

    #set heading(numbering: "1.1")
    #show: great-theorems-init

    #show link: text.with(fill: blue)

    #let mathcounter = rich-counter(
      identifier: "mathblocks",
      inherited_levels: 1
    )

    #let theorem = mathblock(
      blocktitle: "Theorem",
      counter: mathcounter,
    )

    #let lemma = mathblock(
      blocktitle: "Lemma",
      counter: mathcounter,
    )

    #let remark = mathblock(
      blocktitle: "Remark",
      prefix: [_Remark._],
      inset: 5pt,
      fill: lime,
      radius: 5pt,
    )

    #let proof = proofblock()

    = Some Heading

    #theorem[
      This is some theorem.
    ] <mythm>

    #lemma[
      This is a lemma. Maybe it's used to prove @mythm.
    ]

    #proof[
      This is a proof.
    ]

    = Another Heading

    #theorem(title: "some title")[
      This is a theorem with a title.
    ] <thm2>

    #proof(of: <thm2>)[
      This is a proof of the theorem which has a title.
    ]

    #remark[
      This is a remark.
      The remark box has some custom styling applied.
    ]


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/great-
theorems/0.1.1/example.png)

==  Usage

===  ` great-theorems-init `

First, make sure to apply the following inital ` show ` rule to your document:



    #show: great-theorems-init


This is important to make the blocks have the correct alignment and to display
references correctly.

===  ` mathblock `

The main constructor you will use is ` mathblock ` , which allows you to
construct a theorem/proof/remark/â¦ environment in exactly the way you like
it.

Please see the showcase above for on example on how to use it. We now list and
explain all possible arguments.

  - ` blocktitle ` (required)

Usually something like ` "Theorem" ` or ` "Lemma" ` . Determines how
references are displayed, and also determines the default ` prefix ` .

  - ` counter ` (default: ` none ` )

If you want your ` mathblock ` to be counted, pass the counter here. Accepts
either a Typst-native [ ` counter `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/introspection/counter/) (which can be made
to depend on the section with the [ headcount
](https://typst.app/universe/package/headcount/) package) or a ` rich-counter
` from the [ rich-counters ](https://typst.app/universe/package/rich-
counters/) package. If you want multiple ` mathblock ` environments to share
the same counter, just pass the same counter to all of them.

  - ` numbering ` (default: ` "1.1" ` )

The numbering style that should be used to display the counters.

*Note:* If you use the [ headcount
](https://typst.app/universe/package/headcount/) package for your counters,
you have to pass the ` dependent-numbering ` here.

  - ` prefix ` (default: contructed from ` blocktitle ` , bold style)

What should be displayed before the body. If you didnât pass a counter, it
should just be a piece of content like ` [_Theorem._] ` . _If you passed a
counter_ , it should a function/closure, which takes the current counter value
as an argument and returns the corresponding prefix; for example ` (count) =>
[_Theorem #count._] `

  - ` titlix ` (default: ` title => [(#title)] ` )

How a title should be displayed. Will be placed after the prefix if a title is
present. Must be function which takes the title and returns the corresponding
content that should be displayed.

  - ` suffix ` (default: ` none ` )

A suffix that will be displayed after the body.

  - ` bodyfmt ` (default: ` body => body ` i.e. no special formatting)

A function that will style/transform the body. For example, if you want your
theorem contents to be displayed in oblique style, you could pass `
text.with(style: "oblique") ` .

  - arguments for the surrounding [ ` block ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/block/)

The ` mathblock ` , as the name suggests, is surrounded by a [ ` block `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/block/) , which can be styled to
have a background color, stroke color, rounded corners, etc. . You can just
pass all arguments that you could pass to a ` block ` also to ` mathblock ` ,
and it will be âpassed throughâ the surrounding ` block ` . For example,
you could write ` #let theorem = mathblock(..., fill: yellow, inset: 5pt) ` .

So far we have discussed how you _setup_ your environment with ` #let theorem
= mathblock(...) ` . Now letâs discuss how to use the resulting ` theorem `
command. Again, please see the showcase above for some examples on how to use
it. We now list and explain all possible arguments (apart from the body).

  - ` title ` (default: ` none ` )

This allows you to set a title for your theorem/lemma/â¦, which will be
displayed according to ` titlix ` .

  - all the arguments from ` mathblock ` , except ` blocktitle ` and ` counter `

You can change all the parameters of your ` mathblock ` also on an individual
basis, i.e. for each occurrence separately, by just passing the respective
arguments, including ` numbering ` , ` prefix ` , ` titlix ` , ` suffix ` , `
bodyfmt ` , and arguments for ` block ` . These will take precedence over the
global configuration.

===  ` proofblock `

Also a proof environment can be constructed with ` mathblock ` , for example:



    #let proof = mathblock(
      blocktitle: "Proof",
      prefix: [_Proof._],
      suffix: [#h(1fr) $square$],
    )


However, for convenience, we have made another ` proofblock ` constructor. It
works exactly the same as ` mathblock ` , the only differences being:

  - it has different default values for ` blocktitle ` , ` prefix ` , and ` suffix `
  - it has no ` counter ` and ` numbering ` argument
  - the ` titlix ` argument is replaced with a ` prefix_with_of ` argument (also consisting of a function), which will be used as a prefix when the constructed environment is used with ` of ` parameter

The constructed environment will have the following changes compared to an
environment constructed with ` mathblock `

  - the ` title ` argument is replaced with an ` of ` argument, which is used to denote to which theorem/lemma/â¦ the proof belongs

This can be either just content, or a label, in which case a reference to the
label is displayed.

==  FAQ

  - _What is the difference to the ctheorems package?_

You can achieve pretty much the same results with both packages. One goal of `
great-theorems ` was to have a cleaner implementation, for example by
separating the counter functionality from the theorem block functionality. `
ctheorems ` also uses deprecated Typst functionality that will soon be
removed. In the end, however, in comes down to personal preference, and `
ctheorems ` was certainly a big inspiration for this package!

  - _How to set up the counters the way I want?_

Please consult the documentation of [ headcount
](https://typst.app/universe/package/headcount/) and [ rich-counters
](https://typst.app/universe/package/rich-counters/) respectively, we support
both packages as well as native [ ` counter `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/introspection/counter/) s.

  - _My theorems are all center aligned?!_

You forgot to put the initial show rule at the start of your document:


        #show: great-theorems-init


  - _My theorems break across pages, how do I stop that behavior?_

You can pass ` breakable: false ` to ` mathblock ` to construct a non-
breakable environment.

  - _I have a default style for all my theorems/lemmas/remarks/â¦, and Iâm writing boilerplate when I construct theorem/lemma/remark environments._

You can essentially define your own defaults like this:


        #let my_mathblock = mathblock.with(fill: yellow, radius: 5pt, inset: 5pt)

    #let theorem = my_mathblock(...)
    #let lemma = my_mathblock(...)
    #let remark = my_mathblock(...)
    ...


  - _The documentation is too short or unclearâ¦ how do I do X?_

Please just open an [ issue on GitHub ](https://github.com/jbirnick/typst-
great-theorems/issues) , and I will happily answer your question and extend
the documentation!

===  Version history

Version  |  Release Date
---|---
0.1.1  |  October 22, 2024
[ 0.1.0 ](https://typst.app/universe/package/great-theorems/0.1.0/) |  October 16, 2024

Typst GmbH did not create this  package  and cannot guarantee correct
functionality of this  package  or compatibility with any version of the Typst
compiler or app.



= *headcount.md*

=  headcount

0.1.0

Make counters inherit from the heading counter.

This package allows you to make *counters depend on the current
chapter/section number* .

This works for *figures, theorems, and any other counters* .

The advantage compared to [ rich-counters
](https://typst.app/universe/package/rich-counters/) is that you stick with
native ` counter ` s and you can influence e.g. the ` figure ` counter
directly without writing a new ` show ` rule with a custom counter or so.

==  Showcase

In the following example, we demonstrate how you can inherit 1 level of the
heading counter for figures and 2 levels for theorems.



    #import "@preview/headcount:0.1.0": *
    #import "@preview/great-theorems:0.1.0": *

    #show: great-theorems-init

    #set heading(numbering: "1.1")

    // contruct theorem environment with counter that inherits 2 levels from heading
    #let thmcounter = counter("hello")
    #let theorem = mathblock(
      blocktitle: [Theorem],
      counter: thmcounter,
      numbering: dependent-numbering("1.1", levels: 2)
    )
    #show heading: reset-counter(thmcounter, levels: 2)

    // set figure counter so that it inherits 1 level from heading
    #set figure(numbering: dependent-numbering("1.1"))
    #show heading: reset-counter(counter(figure.where(kind: image)))

    = First heading

    The theorems inherit 2 levels from the headings and the figures inherit 1 level from the headings.

    #theorem[Some theorem.]
    #theorem[Some theorem.]
    #figure([SOME FIGURE], caption: [some figure])
    #figure([SOME FIGURE], caption: [some figure])

    == Subheading

    #theorem[Some theorem.]
    #figure([SOME FIGURE], caption: [some figure])
    #figure([SOME FIGURE], caption: [some figure])

    = Second heading

    #theorem[Some theorem.]
    #figure([SOME FIGURE], caption: [some figure])
    #theorem[Some theorem.]


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/headcount/0.1.0/example.png)

==  Usage

To make another ` counter ` inherit from the heading counter, you have to do
*two* things.

  1. For the numbering of your counter, you have to use ` dependent-numbering(...) ` .

     - ` dependent-numbering(style, level: 1) ` (needs ` context ` )

Is a replacement for the ` numbering ` function, with the difference that it
precedes any counter value with ` level ` many values of the heading counter.


        #import "@preview/headcount:0.1.0": *

    #set heading(numbering: "1.1")

    #let mycounter = counter("hello")

    = First heading

    #context mycounter.step()
    #context mycounter.display(dependent-numbering("1.1"))

    = Second heading

    #context mycounter.step()
    #context mycounter.display(dependent-numbering("1.1"))

    #context mycounter.step()
    #context mycounter.display(dependent-numbering("1.1"))


This displays the desired amount of levels of the heading counter in front of
the actual counter. However, as you can see in the code above, our actual
counter does not yet reset in each section.

  2. For resetting the counter at the appropriate places, you need to equip ` heading ` with the ` show ` rule that ` reset-counter(...) ` returns.

     - ` reset-counter(counter, level: 1) ` (needs ` context ` )

Returns a function that should be used as a ` show ` rule for ` heading ` . It
will reset ` counter ` if the level of the heading is less than or equal to `
level ` .

*Important:* This ` show ` rule should be placed as the _last_ ` show ` rule
for ` heading ` , or at least after ` show ` rules for ` heading ` that employ
a custom design, see [ here ](https://forum.typst.app/t/i-figured-broken-with-
custom-template/1730/10?u=jbirnick) for an explanation.


        #import "@preview/headcount:0.1.0": *

    #set heading(numbering: "1.1")
    #show heading: reset-counter(mycounter, levels: 1)

    #let mycounter = counter("hello")

    = First heading

    #context mycounter.step()
    #context mycounter.display(dependent-numbering("1.1"))

    = Second heading

    #context mycounter.step()
    #context mycounter.display(dependent-numbering("1.1"))

    #context mycounter.step()
    #context mycounter.display(dependent-numbering("1.1"))


*Note:* The ` level ` that you pass to ` dependent-numbering(...) ` and the
` level ` that you pass to ` reset-counter(...) ` must be the _same_ .

==  Limitations

Due to current Typst limitations, there is no way to detect manual updates or
steps of the heading counter, like ` counter(heading).update(...) ` or `
counter(heading).step(...) ` . Only occurrences of actual ` heading ` s can be
detected. So make sure that after you call e.g. ` counter(heading).update(...)
` , you place a heading directly after it, before you use any counters that
depend on the heading counter.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=orange-book&version=0.4.0)

A book template inspired by The Legrand Orange Book of Mathias Legrand and Vel
[ https://www.latextemplates.com/template/legrand-orange-book
](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/legrand-orange-book) .

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` orange-book ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/orange-book


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` book ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` title ` : The bookâs title as content.
  - ` subtitle ` : The bookâs subtitle as content.
  - ` author ` : Content or an array of content to specify the author.
  - ` paper-size ` : Defaults to ` a4 ` . Specify a [ paper size string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-paper) to change the page format.
  - ` copyright ` : Details about the copyright or ` none ` .
  - ` lowercase-references ` : True to have references in lowercase (Eg. table 1.1)

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
book.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` book `
function in a show rule. If you, however, want to change an existing project
to use this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your
file:



    #import "@preview/orange-book:0.1.0": book

![A preview of the kunskap Typst

=  kunskap

0.1.0

A template with generous spacing for reports, assignments, course documents,
and similar (shorter) documents.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=kunskap&version=0.1.0)

A [ Typst ](https://typst.app/) template mainly intended for shorter academic
documents such as reports, assignments, course documents, and so on. Its name,
_âkunskapâ_ , means _knowledge_ in Swedish.

See [ this example PDF ](https://github.com/mbollmann/typst-
kunskap/blob/main/example.pdf) for a longer demonstration of how it looks.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` kunskap ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/kunskap


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` kunskap ` function with several arguments. You
will want to set at least the following, describing the metadata of your
document:

Argument  |  Description
---|---
` title ` |  Title of your document
` author ` |  Author(s) of your document; can be any content, or an array of strings
` date ` |  Date string to display below the author(s); defaults to a string of todayâs date, but can take any content. Set to ` none ` if you donât use it at all.
` header ` |  Content that appears in the left-hand side of the header on every page; this is intended for e.g. the name of a course or some other contextual information for the document, but can of course also be left empty.

Additionally, you can configure some aspects of the templateâs layout with
the following arguments:

Argument  |  Description  |  Default
---|---|---
` paper-size ` |  Paper size of the document  |  ` "a4" `
` body-font ` |  Font for the body text  |  ` "Noto Serif" `
` body-font-size ` |  Font size for the body text  |  ` 10pt `
` headings-font ` |  Font for the headings  |  ` ("Source Sans Pro", "Source Sans 3") `
` raw-font ` |  Font for raw (i.e. monospaced) text  |  ` ("Hack", "Source Code Pro") ` [^1]
` raw-font-size ` |  Font size for raw text  |  ` 9pt `
` link-color ` |  Color for highlighting [ links ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/link/) |  ` rgb("#3282b8") ` ![Color sample](https://img.shields.io/badge/steel_blue-3282b8)
` muted-color ` |  Color for muted text, such as page numbers and headers after the first page  |  ` luma(160) `
` block-bg-color ` |  Color for the background of raw text  |  ` luma(240) `

The template will initialize your document with a sample call to the ` kunskap
` function. Alternatively, hereâs a minimal example of how you could use
this template in your document:



    #import "@preview/kunskap:0.1.0": *

    #show: kunskap.with(
        title: "Your report title",
        author: "Your name",
        date: datetime.today().display(),
        header: "Your course name",
    )

    #lorem(120)


==  Missing features

As of now, this template has not yet been particularly optimized for styling
related to:

  - Bibliographies
  - Outlines (e.g. table of contents)
  - Tables

==  Credits

This template started out by emulating the layout of course documents in [
Marco Kuhlmann ](https://liu.se/en/employee/marku61) âs courses at
LinkÃ¶ping University.[^2] On the technical side, this template took a lot of
inspiration from [ the ` ilm ` template ](https://github.com/talal/ilm/) ,
even if the design decisions may be radically different.

[^1]: The [ Hack font ](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack) is currently
not available on the Typst web app, so the fallback is Source Code Pro. [^2]:
If you work at LinkÃ¶ping University, you can set ` headings-font:
"KorolevLiU" ` to get a LiU-branded version of this template.

0.3.0

Documentation generator for Typst code in Typst.

Featured  Package

_Keep it tidy._

[ ![Typst
Package](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/toml?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMc-

Manual](https://img.shields.io/badge/manual-.pdf-purple)
](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/tidy/releases/download/v0.3.0/tidy-guide.pdf)

*tidy* is a package that generates documentation directly in [ Typst
](https://typst.app/) for your Typst modules. It parses docstring comments
similar to javadoc and co. and can be used to easily build a beautiful
reference section for the parsed module. Within the docstring you may use
(almost) any Typst syntax â so markup, equations and even figures are no
problem!

Features:

  - *Customizable* output styles.
  - Automatically [ *render code examples* ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tidy/0.3.0/#example) .
  - *Annotate types* of parameters and return values.
  - Automatically read off default values for named parameters.
  - [ *Help* feature ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tidy/0.3.0/#generate-a-help-command-for-you-package) for your package.
  - [ Docstring tests ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tidy/0.3.0/#docstring-tests) .

The [ guide ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/tidy/releases/download/v0.3.0/tidy-
guide.pdf) fully describes the usage of this module and defines the format for
the docstrings.

==  Usage

Using ` tidy ` is as simple as writing some docstrings and calling:



    #import "@preview/tidy:0.3.0"

    #let docs = tidy.parse-module(read("my-module.typ"))
    #tidy.show-module(docs, style: tidy.styles.default)


The available predefined styles are currenty ` tidy.styles.default ` and `
tidy.styles.minimal ` . Custom styles can be added by hand (take a look at the
[ guide ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/tidy/releases/download/v0.3.0/tidy-
guide.pdf) ).

==  Example

A full example on how to use this module for your own package (maybe even
consisting of multiple files) can be found at [ examples
](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/tidy/tree/main/examples) .



    /// This function computes the cardinal sine, $sinc(x)=sin(x)/x$.
    ///
    /// #example(`#sinc(0)`, mode: "markup")
    ///
    /// - x (int, float): The argument for the cardinal sine function.
    /// -> float
    #let sinc(x) = if x == 0 {1} else {calc.sin(x) / x}


*tidy* turns this into:

===  ![Tidy example
output](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/tidy/0.3.0/docs/images/sincx-
docs.svg)

==  Access user-defined functions and images

The code in the docstrings is evaluated via ` eval() ` . In order to access
user-defined functions and images, you can make use of the ` scope ` argument
of ` tidy.parse-module() ` :



    #{
        import "my-module.typ"
        let module = tidy.parse-module(read("my-module.typ"))
        let an-image = image("img.png")
        tidy.show-module(
            module,
            style: tidy.styles.default,
            scope: (my-module: my-module, img: an-image)
        )
    }


The docstrings in ` my-module.typ ` may now access the image with ` #img ` and
can call any function or variable from ` my-module ` in the style of ` #my-
module.my-function() ` . This makes rendering examples right in the docstrings
as easy as a breeze!

==  Generate a help command for you package

With *tidy* , you can add a help command to you package that allows users to
obtain the documentation of a specific definition or parameter right in the
document. This is similar to CLI-style help commands. If you have already
written docstrings for your package, it is quite low-effort to add this
feature. Once set up, the end-user can use it like this:



    // happily coding, but how do I use this one complex function again?

    #mypackage.help("func")
    #mypackage.help("func(param1)") // print only parameter description of param1


This will print the documentation of ` func ` directly into the document â
no need to look it up in a manual. Read up in the [ guide
](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/tidy/releases/download/v0.3.0/tidy-guide.pdf) for
setup instructions.

==  Docstring tests

It is possible to add simple docstring tests â assertions that will be run
when the documentation is generated. This is useful if you want to keep small
tests and documentation in one place.



    /// #test(
    ///   `num.my-square(2) == 4`,
    ///   `num.my-square(4) == 16`,
    /// )
    #let my-square(n) = n * n


With the short-hand syntax, a unfulfilled assertion will even print the line
number of the failed test:



    /// >>> my-square(2) == 4
    /// >>> my-square(4) == 16
    #let my-square(n) = n * n


A few test assertion functions are available to improve readability,
simplicity, and error messages. Currently, these are ` eq(a, b) ` for equality
tests, ` ne(a, b) ` for inequality tests and ` approx(a, b, eps: 1e-10) ` for
floating point comparisons. These assertion helper functions are always
available within docstring tests (with both ` test() ` and ` >>> ` syntax).

==  Changelog

===  v0.3.0

  - New features:
    - Help feature.
    - ` preamble ` option for examples (e.g., to add ` import ` statements).
    - more options for ` show-module ` : ` omit-private-definitions ` , ` omit-private-parameters ` , ` enable-cross-references ` , ` local-names ` (for configuring language-specific strings).
  - Improvements:
    - Allow using ` show-example() ` as standalone.
    - Updated type names that changed with Typst 0.8.0, e.g., integer -> int.
  - Fixes:
    - allow examples with ratio widths if ` scale-preview ` is not ` auto ` .
    - ` show-outline `
    - explicitly use ` raw(lang: none) ` for types and function names.

===  v0.2.0

  - New features:
    - Add executable examples to docstrings.
    - Documentation for variables (as well as functions).
    - Docstring tests.
    - Rainbow-colored types ` color ` and ` gradient ` .
  - Improvements:
    - Allow customization of cross-references through ` show-reference() ` .
    - Allow customization of spacing between functions through styles.
    - Allow color customization (especially for the ` default ` theme).
  - Fixes:
    - Empty parameter descriptions are omitted (if the corresponding option is set).
    - Trim newline characters from parameter descriptions.
  - â ï¸ Breaking changes:
    - Before, cross-references for functions using the ` @@ ` syntax could omit the function parentheses. Now this is not possible anymore, since such references refer to variables now.
    - (only concerning custom styles) The style functions ` show-outline() ` , ` show-parameter-list ` , and ` show-type() ` now take ` style-args ` arguments as well.

===  v0.1.0

Initial Release.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` letter ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` sender ` : The letterâs sender as content. This is displayed at the top of the page.
  - ` recipient ` : The address of the letterâs recipient as content. This is displayed near the top of the page.
  - ` date ` : The date, and possibly place, the letter was written at as content. Flushed to the right after the address.
  - ` subject ` : The subject line for the letter as content.
  - ` name ` : The name the letter closes with as content.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
letter.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` letter `
function in a show rule. If you, however, want to change an existing project
to use this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your
file:



    #import "@preview/appreciated-letter:0.1.0": letter

  - ` literaturverzeichnis ` : ` function ` \- The bibliography prefilled with the BibTex file path

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
paper.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the `
diplomarbeit ` function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing
project to use thistemplate, you can add a show rule like this at the top of
your file:



    #import "@preview/htlwienwest-da:0.1.0": *

      anhang: include "anhang.typ", // entfernen falls nicht benÃ¶tigt
      literaturverzeichnis: bibliography.with("literaturverzeichnis.bib")
    )

    // Your content goes below.


==  Provided Functions

Beside the ` diplomarbeit ` function, the template also provides the ` autor `
function that is used after a heading to indicate the specific author of the
current section.



    == Some Heading
    #autor[Your Name]


This will render additional information to the sectionâs heading.

To install the template locally, you can use



    just install


which uses the [ just ](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner.

If you donât want to install ` just ` , you can run



    bash ./scripts/package @local


The installed version can be used via ` @local ` instead of ` @preview ` . To
create a new typst project from the template, run



    typst init @local/htlwienwest-da:

      // no fill for level-1 entries, a thin gray line for all deeper levels
      fill: (none, line(length: 100%, stroke: gray + .5pt)),
    )


==  Usage

===  ` show-entry `

Show the given outline entry with the provided styling. Should be used in a
show rule like ` #show outline.entry: outrageous.show-entry ` .



    #let show-entry(
      entry,
      font-weight: presets.outrageous-toc.font-weight,
      font-style: presets.outrageous-toc.font-style,
      vspace: presets.outrageous-toc.vspace,
      font: presets.outrageous-toc.font,
      fill: presets.outrageous-toc.fill,
      fill-right-pad: presets.outrageous-toc.fill-right-pad,
      fill-align: presets.outrageous-toc.fill-align,
      body-transform: presets.outrageous-toc.body-transform,
      label: <outrageous-modified-entry>,
      state-key: "outline-page-number-max-width",
    ) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

For all the arguments that take arrays, the arrayâs first item specifies the
value for all level-one entries, the second item for level-two, and so on. The
arrayâs last item will be used for all deeper/following levels as well.

  - ` entry ` : [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The [ ` outline.entry ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/outline/#definitions-entry) element from the show rule.
  - ` font-weight ` : [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) of ( [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or [ ` int ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/int/) or ` auto ` or ` none ` ) â The entryâs font weight. Setting to ` auto ` or ` none ` keeps the contextâs current style.
  - ` font-style ` : [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) of ( [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or ` auto ` or ` none ` ) â The entryâs font style. Setting to ` auto ` or ` none ` keeps the contextâs current style.
  - ` vspace ` : [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) of ( [ ` relative ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/relative/) or [ ` fraction ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/fraction/) or ` none ` ) â Vertical spacing to add above the entry. Setting to ` none ` adds no space.
  - ` font ` : [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) of ( [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) or ` auto ` or ` none ` ) â The entryâs font. Setting to ` auto ` or ` none ` keeps the contextâs current font.
  - ` fill ` : [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) of ( [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) or ` auto ` or ` none ` ) â The entryâs fill. Setting to ` auto ` keeps the contextâs current setting.
  - ` fill-right-pad ` : [ ` relative ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/relative/) or ` none ` â Horizontal space to put between the fill and page number.
  - ` fill-align ` : [ ` bool ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) â Whether ` fill-right-pad ` should be relative to the current page number or the widest page number. Setting this to ` true ` has the effect of all fills ending on the same vertical line.
  - ` body-transform ` : [ ` function ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/) or ` none ` â Callback for custom edits to the entryâs body. It gets passed the entryâs level ( [ ` int ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/int/) ) and body ( [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) ) and should return [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) or ` none ` . If ` none ` is returned, no modifications are made.
  - ` page-transform ` : [ ` function ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/) or ` none ` â Callback for custom edits to the entryâs page number. It gets passed the entryâs level ( [ ` int ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/int/) ) and page number ( [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) ) and should return [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) or ` none ` . If ` none ` is returned, no modifications are made.
  - ` label ` : [ ` label ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/label/) â The label to internally use for tracking recursion. This should not need to be modified.
  - ` state-key ` : [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) â The key to use for the internal state which tracks the maximum page number width. The state is global for the entire document and thus applies to all outlines. If you wish to re-calculate the max page number width for ` fill-align ` , then you must provide a different key for each outline.

*Returns:* [ ` content `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/)

===  ` presets `

Presets for the arguments for [ ` show-entry() `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/outrageous/0.3.0/#show-
entry) . You can use them in your show rule with ` #show outline.entry:
outrageous.show-entry.with(..outrageous.presets.outrageous-figures) ` .



    #let presets = (
      // outrageous preset for a Table of Contents
      outrageous-toc: (
        // ...
      ),
      // outrageous preset for List of Figures/Tables/Listings
      outrageous-figures: (
        // ...
      ),
      // preset without any style changes
      typst: (
        // ...
      ),
    )


===  ` repeat `

Utility function to repeat content to fill space with a fixed size gap.



    #let repeat(gap: none, justify: false, body) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` gap ` : [ ` length ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/length/) or ` none ` â The gap between repeated items.
  - ` justify ` : [ ` bool ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) â Whether to increase the gap to justify the items.
  - ` body ` : [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The content to repeat.

*Returns:* [ ` content `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/)

===  ` align-helper `

Utility function to help with aligning multiple items.



    #let align-helper(state-key, what-to-measure, display) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` state-key ` : [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) â The key to use for the [ ` state ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/introspection/state/) that keeps track of the maximum encountered width.
  - ` what-to-measure ` : [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The content to measure at this call.
  - ` display ` : [ ` function ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/) â A callback which gets passed the maximum encountered width and the width of the current item (what was given to ` what-to-measure ` ), both as [ ` length ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/length/) , and should return [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) which can make use of these widths for alignment.

*Returns:* [ ` content `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/)

ovgu-thesis ` . Please refer to [ cd.ovgu.de
](https://www.cd.ovgu.de/Fakult%C3%A4ten.html) for more information regarding
the OvGU corporate design and for the signet and logo of your faculty.

Header logos are set in ` metadata.typ ` :



    // Example 1: Use UCC logo as organisation-logo and the FIN faculty header as header-logo
    #let organisation-logo = image("assets/figure/optimal-ovgu-thesis/ucc.svg", width: 2cm)
    #let header-logo = image("assets/figure/optimal-ovgu-thesis/fin-de.svg", width: 100%)

    // Example 2: Do not use logos at all
    #let organisation-logo = none
    #let header-logo = none


==  Fonts

This template requires these two fonts to be installed on your system:

  - New Computer Modern
  - New Computer Modern Sans

===  NixOS

In your ` configuration.nix ` :



      fonts.packages = with pkgs; [
        liberation_ttf # here are your other fonts (liberation is just an example)
      ] ++ texlive.newcomputermodern.pkgs; # â New Computer Modern font


==  Development

In case you want to contribute, check out the repo into a [ typst package
directory ](https://github.com/typst/packages?tab=readme-ov-file#local-

To use this package simply ` #import "@preview/ouset:0.2.0" ` . To import all
functions use ` : * ` and for specific ones, use either the module or as
described in the [ typst docs
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/scripting#modules) .

The main function provided in this package is ` ouset ` for math environments.
This function can take arbitrary many arguments, but with the following rules:

  - if the first argument is ` & ` , a âalignpointâ is inserted immediately before the symbol
  - next follows the symbol, then the content to put on top, and then the content to put at the bottom
  - if the last argument is ` & ` , a âalignpointâ is inserted immediately after the symbol

There is a named argument ` insert-and ` , which if false, does not insert an
âalignpointâ in the above cases, but only clips at these points.

This package provides furthermore 3 other functions:

  - ` overset(s, t, c: 0, insert-and: true) ` : output the symbol s with t on top of it
  - ` underset(s, b, c: 0 insert-and: true) ` : output the symbol s with b on below of it
  - ` overunderset(s, t, b, c: 0, insert-and: true) ` : output the symbol s with t on top of it and b below it

All functions put enough spacing around the operator, such that other content
does not interfere with it. However, this spacing can be disabled, by setting
` c ` to 1, 2 or 3. This is a flag system with

  - ` c=0 ` : normal spacing on the left and right
  - ` c=1 ` : left spacing is according to the operator / symbol s and right spacing is normal
  - ` c=2 ` : left spacing is normal and right spacing according to the operator / symbol s
  - ` c=3 ` : both spacings are according to the operator / symbol s

Hence: clip param ` c â {0,1,2,3} â {no clip, left clip, right clip, both
clip} `

==  Example usage

Try something like:

  - ` $ouset(-->,, n->oo)$ `
  - ` $ouset(-,1,2)$ `
  *     #import "@preview/ouset:0.2.0": ouset

    $ M &= sum_(k=0)^oo q^k = 1 + q + q^2 + q^3 + q^4 + dots\
        &= 1 + q (1 + q + q^2 + q^3 + dots)\
        ouset(&, =, "Def.", "of" M) 1 + q dot M $

= *tinyset.md*

=  tinyset

0.1.0

Simple, consistent, and appealing math homework template

Extremely simple [ typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) package for writing
math problem sets quickly and consistently. Under the hood it is just typst
fundamentals that could be defined by hand, however the aim of this package is
to make you faster and the code easier to read.

==  Usage

Import styles and create a new header. I like to copy this from the top of the
previous weekâs homework (donât forget to increment the number!).

Example using proof, question, and part environments. Indentation in source
code is largely ignored and left to personal preference. By default questions
are numbered and each part is lettered, you can change this based on course /
instructor preference.



    #import "@preview/tinyset:0.1.0": *
    #header(number: 7, name: "Sylvan Franklin", class: "Math 3551 - Fall 2024")

    + #qs[
    Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be groups, $phi : G_1 -> G_2$ be a homomorphism, and $H$ be
    any subgroup of $G_2$. Define

    $ phi^(-1)(H) = {g in G_1 : phi(g) in H}. $

    + #pt[
        Prove that $phi^(-1)(H)$ is a subgroup of $G_1$.
        #prf[ Non empty: Since $H$ is a subgroup it contains the indentity, and
        since $phi$ is a homomorphism and ... ]
    ]

    + #pt[
        What about a question that you don't need a proof for?
        #ans[Use the ans environment]
    ]

    ]



==  Custom shorthand

Sometimes when thinking about math I find it easier to phonetically write out
these symbols instead of using the built in typst classes. For certain others
I find the original symbols annoying to type quickly.

shorthand  |  expansion
---|---
implies / impl  |  ==>
iff  |  <==>
wlog  |  without loss of generality
inv()  |  ()^(-1)

= *minitoc.md*

=  minitoc

0.1.0

An outline function just for one section and nothing else

This package provides the ` minitoc ` command that does the same thing as the
` outline ` command but only for headings under the heading above it.

This is inspired by minitoc package for LaTeX.

==  Example



    #import "@preview/minitoc:0.1.0": *
    #set heading(numbering: "1.1")

    #outline()

    = Heading 1

    #minitoc()

    == Heading 1.1

    #lorem(20)

    === Heading 1.1.1

    #lorem(30)

    == Heading 1.2

    #lorem(10)

    = Heading 2



This produces

![](https://gitlab.com/human_person/typst-local-
outline/-/raw/main/example/example.png)

==  Usage

The ` minitoc ` function has the following signature:



    #let minitoc(
      title: none, target: heading.where(outlined: true),
    	depth: none, indent: none, fill: repeat([.])
    ) { /* .. */ }


This is designed to be as close to the [ ` outline `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/) funtions as possible. The
arguments are:

  - *title* : The title for the local outline. This is the same as for [ ` outline.title ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/#parameters-title) .
  - *target* : What should be included. This is the same as for [ ` outline.target ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/#parameters-target)
  - *depth* : The maximum depth different to include. For example, if depth was 1 in the example, âHeading 1.1.1â would not be included
  - *indent* : How the entries should be indented. Takes the same types as for [ ` outline.indent ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/#parameters-indent) and is passed directly to it
  - *fill* : Content to put between the numbering and title, and the page number. Same types as for [ ` outline.fill ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/#parameters-fill)

==  Unintended consequences

Because ` minitoc ` uses ` outline ` , if you apply numbering to the title of
outline with ` #show outline: set heading(numbering: "1.") ` or similar, any
title in ` minitoc ` will be numbered and be a level 1 heading. This cannot be
changed with ` #show outline: set heading(level: 3) ` or similar
unfortunately.

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` minitoc `

= *fontawesome.md*

=  fontawesome

0.5.0

A Typst library for Font Awesome icons through the desktop fonts.

A Typst library for Font Awesome icons through the desktop fonts.

p.s. The library is based on the Font Awesome 6 desktop fonts (v6.6.0)

==  Usage

===  Install the fonts

You can download the fonts from the official website: [
https://fontawesome.com/download ](https://fontawesome.com/download)

After downloading the zip file, you can install the fonts depending on your
OS.

====  Typst web app

You can simply upload the ` otf ` files to the web app and use them with this
package.

====  Mac

You can double click the ` otf ` files to install them.

====  Windows

You can right-click the ` otf ` files and select ` Install ` .

====  Some notes

This library is tested with the otf files of the Font Awesome Free set.
TrueType fonts may not work as expected. (Though I am not sure whether Font
Awesome provides TrueType fonts, some issue is reported with TrueType fonts.)

===  Import the library

====  Using the typst packages

You can install the library using the typst packages:

` #import "@preview/fontawesome:0.5.0": * `

====  Manually install

Copy all files start with ` lib ` to your project and import the library:

` #import "lib.typ": * `

There are three files:

  - ` lib.typ ` : The main entrypoint of the library.
  - ` lib-impl.typ ` : The implementation of ` fa-icon ` .
  - ` lib-gen.typ ` : The generated icon map and functions.

I recommend renaming these files to avoid conflicts with other libraries.

===  Use the icons

You can use the ` fa-icon ` function to create an icon with its name:

` #fa-icon("chess-queen") `

Or you can use the ` fa- ` prefix to create an icon with its name:

` #fa-chess-queen() ` (This is equivalent to ` #fa-icon().with("chess-queen")
` )

You can also set ` solid ` to ` true ` to use the solid version of the icon:

` #fa-icon("chess-queen", solid: true) `

Some icons only have the solid version in the Free set, so you need to set `
solid ` to ` true ` to use them if you are using the Free set. Otherwise, you
may not get the expected glyph.

====  Full list of icons

You can find all icons on the [ official website
](https://fontawesome.com/search)

====  Different sets

By default, the library supports ` Free ` , ` Brands ` , ` Pro ` , ` Duotone `
and ` Sharp ` sets. (See [ Enable Pro sets
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/fontawesome/0.5.0/#enable-
pro-sets) for enabling Pro sets.)

But only ` Free ` and ` Brands ` are tested by me. That is, three font files
are used to test:

  - Font Awesome 6 Free (Also named as _Font Awesome 6 Free Regular_ )
  - Font Awesome 6 Free Solid
  - Font Awesome 6 Brands

Due to some limitations of typst 0.12.0, the regular and solid versions are
treated as different fonts. In this library, ` solid ` is used to switch
between the regular and solid versions.

To use other sets or specify one set, you can pass the ` font ` parameter to
the inner ` text ` function:
` fa-icon("github", font: "Font Awesome 6 Pro Solid") `

If you have Font Awesome Pro, please help me test the library with the Pro
set. Any feedback is appreciated.

=====  Enable Pro sets

Typst 0.12.0 raise a warning when the font is not found. To use the Pro set, `
#fa-use-pro() ` should be called before any ` fa-* ` functions.



    #fa-use-pro()                 // Enable Pro sets

    #fa-icon("chess-queen-piece") // Use icons from Pro sets


====  Customization

The ` fa-icon ` function passes args to ` text ` , so you can customize the
icon by passing parameters to it:

` #fa-icon("chess-queen", fill: blue) `

====  Stacking icons

The ` fa-stack ` function can be used to create stacked icons:

` #fa-stack(fa-icon-args: (solid: true), "square", ("chess-queen", (fill:
white, size: 5.5pt))) `

Declaration is ` fa-stack(box-args: (:), grid-args: (:), fa-icon-args: (:),
..icons) `

  - The order of the icons is from the bottom to the top.
  - ` fa-icon-args ` is used to set the default args for all icons.
  - You can also control the internal ` box ` and ` grid ` by passing the ` box-args ` and ` grid-args ` to the ` fa-stack ` function.
  - Currently, four types of icons are supported. The first three types leverage the ` fa-icon ` function, and the last type is just a content you want to put in the stack.
    - ` str ` , e.g., ` "square" `
    - ` array ` , e.g., ` ("chess-queen", (fill: white, size: 5.5pt)) `
    - ` arguments ` , e.g. ` arguments("chess-queen", solid: true, fill: white) `
    - ` content ` , e.g. ` fa-chess-queen(solid: true, fill: white) `

====  Known Issues

  - [ typst#2578 ](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2578) [ typst-fontawesome#2 ](https://github.com/duskmoon314/typst-fontawesome/issues/2)

This is a known issue that the ligatures may not work in headings, list items,
grid items, and other elements. You can use the Unicode from the [ official
website ](https://fontawesome.com/) to avoid this issue when using Pro sets.

For most icons, Unicode is used implicitly. So I assume we usually donât
need to worry about this.

Any help on this issue is appreciated.

==  Example

See the [ ` example.typ ` ](https://typst.app/project/rQwGUWt5p33vrsb_uNPR9F)
file for a complete example.

==  Contribution

Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you find any problems or have
any suggestions.

===  Python helper

The ` helper.py ` script is used to get metadata via the GraphQL API and
generate typst code. I aim only to use standard python libraries, so running
it on any platform with python installed should be easy.

===  Repo structure

  - ` helper.py ` : The helper script to get metadata and generate typst code.
  - ` lib.typ ` : The main entrypoint of the library.
  - ` lib-impl.typ ` : The implementation of ` fa-icon ` .
  - ` lib-gen.typ ` : The generated functions of icons.
  - ` example.typ ` : An example file to show how to use the library.
  - ` gallery.typ ` : The generated gallery of icons. It is used in the example file.

==  License

This library is licensed under the MIT license. Feel free to use it in your
project.

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` fontawesome `



    #import "@preview/fontawesome:0.5.0"

=  genealotree

0.1.0

A package to draw genealogical trees, based on CeTZ

Genealotree is a typst package to draw genealogical trees. It is developped at
[ https://codeberg.org/drloiseau/genealogy
](https://codeberg.org/drloiseau/genealogy) . This is the place you can get
the developpement version and send issues and pull requests.

![Example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/genealotree/0.1.0/examples/example.jpg)

This package is based on [ CeTZ
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/genealotree/0.1.0/%22https://typst.app/universe/package/cetz/%22)
and it provides functions to draw genealogical trees. It is oriented towards
medical genealogy to study genetic disorders inheritance, but you might be
able to use it to draw your family tree.

*Features :*

  - Draw an unlimited number of independant genealogical trees
  - Supports consanguinity and unions between different trees (see limitations)
  - Auto adjusts position of children to optimize spacing
  - Customize all lengths
  - Draw as much phenotypes as needed by coloring individuals
  - Print genotype and/or phenotype labels under individuals

*Limitations :*

  - Must manually adjust individual position in the tree when drawing consanguinity and unions between trees to prevent overlapping of individuals.
  - No remarriages (might be added in a future version)
  - No union between individuals at different generations (might be added in a future version)

*To be implemented :*

  - Allow to pass CeTZ arguments to every elements to cutomize their appearance
  - Draw optional legends for tree symbols and for phenotypes

See example.typ for a simple usage example, and the manual for precise
references at [ manual.pdf
](https://codeberg.org/attachments/cfdad2b7-52ae-4e18-8d7b-453fadc45532)

The steps to produce a tree are :

  - Import the package and CeTZ



    #import "@preview/genealotree:0.1.0": *
    #import "@preview/cetz:0.2.2": canvas


  - Create a genealogy object



    let my-geneal = genealogy-init()


  - Add persons to the object : pass a dictionary mapping a persons name with a dictionary describing its characteristics. See the manual for a full reference.



    let my-geneal = add-persons(
      my-geneal,
      (
        "I1": (sex: "m"),
        "I2": (sex: "f"),
        "II1": (sex: "f"),
      )
    )


  - Set unions between persons : give the parents names as an array of 2 strings, and the children names as an array of strings.



    let my-geneal = add-unions(
      my-geneal,
      (("I1", "I2"), ("II1",))
    )


  - Open up a CeTZ canva and draw the tree



    #canvas(length: 0.4cm, {
        draw-tree(my-geneal)
    })


===  How to add

=  pesha

0.4.0

A clean and minimal template for your rÃ©sumÃ© or CV

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=pesha&version=0.4.0)

> Pesha (Urdu: Ù¾ÛØ´Û) is the Urdu term for occupation/profession. It is
> pronounced as pay-sha.

A clean and minimal template for your CV or rÃ©sumÃ©.

This template is inspired by Matthew Butterickâs excellent [ _Practical
Typography_ ](https://practicaltypography.com/) book.

See [ example.pdf ](https://github.com/talal/pesha/blob/main/example.pdf) or [
example-profile-picture.pdf
](https://github.com/talal/pesha/blob/main/example-profile-picture.pdf) file
to see how it looks.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` pesha ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/pesha


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` pesha ` function with the following named
arguments:

Argument  |  Type  |  Description
---|---|---
` name ` |  [ string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) |  A string to specify the authorâs name.
` address ` |  [ string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) |  A string to specify the authorâs address.
` contacts ` |  [ array ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) |  An array of content to specify your contact information. E.g., phone number, email, LinkedIn, etc.
` profile-picture ` |  [ content ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) |  The result of a call to the [ image function ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/image/) or ` none ` . For best result, make sure that your image has an 1:1 aspect ratio.
` paper-size ` |  [ string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) |  Specify a [ paper size string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page#parameters-paper) to change the page size (default is ` a4 ` ).
` footer-text ` |  [ content ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) |  Content that will be prepended to the page numbering in the footer.
` page-numbering-format ` |  [ string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) |  [ Pattern ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/numbering/#parameters-numbering) that will be used for displaying page numbering in the footer (default is ` 1 of 1 ` ).

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` pesha `
function in a show rule. If you, however, want to change an existing project
to use this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your
file:



    #import "@preview/pesha:0.4.0": *

    #show: pesha.with(
      name: "Max Mustermann",
      address: "5419 Hollywood Blvd Ste c731, Los Angeles, CA 90027",
      contacts: (
        [(323) 555 1435],
        [#link("mailto:max@mustermann.com")],
      ),
      paper-size: "us-letter",
      footer-text: [Mustermann RÃ©sumÃ© ---]
    )

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=minerva-report-fcfm&version=0.2.1)

Template para hacer tareas, informes y trabajos, para estudiantes y
acadÃ©micos de la Facultad de Ciencias FÃ­sicas y MatemÃ¡ticas de la
Universidad de Chile que han usado templates similares para LaTeX.

==  GuÃ­a RÃ¡pida

===  [ Webapp ](https://typst.app/)

Si utilizas la webapp de Typst puedes presionar âStart from templateâ y
buscar âminerva-report-fcfmâ para crear un nuevo proyecto con este
template.

===  Typst CLI

Teniendo el CLI con la versiÃ³n 0.11.0 o mayor, puedes realizar:



    typst init @preview/minerva-report-fcfm:0.2.1


Esto va a descargar el template en la cache de typst y luego va a iniciar el
proyecto en la carpeta actual.

==  ConfiguraciÃ³n

La mayorÃ­a de la configuraciÃ³n se realiza a travÃ©s del archivo ` meta.typ `
, allÃ­ podrÃ¡s elegir un tÃ­tulo, indicar los autores, el equipo docente,
entre otras configuraciones.

El campo ` autores ` solo puede ser ` string ` o un ` array ` de strings.

La configuraciÃ³n ` departamento ` puede ser personalizada a cualquier
organizaciÃ³n pasandole un diccionario de esta forma:



    #let departamento = (
      nombre: (
        "Universidad TÃ©cnica Federico Santa MarÃ­a",
      )
    )


Las demÃ¡s configuraciones pueden ser un ` content ` arbitrario, o un ` string
` .

===  ConfiguraciÃ³n Avanzada

Algunos aspectos mÃ¡s avanzados pueden ser configurados a travÃ©s de la show
rule que inicializa el documento ` #show: minerva.report.with( ... ) ` , los
parÃ¡metros opcionales que recibe la funciÃ³n ` report ` son los siguientes:

nombre  |  tipo  |  descriciÃ³n
---|---|---
portada  |  (meta) => content  |  Una funciÃ³n que recibe el diccionario ` meta.typ ` y retorna una pÃ¡gina.
header  |  (meta) => content  |  Header a aplicarse a cada pÃ¡gina.
footer  |  (meta) => content  |  Footer a aplicarse a cada pÃ¡gina.
showrules  |  bool  |  El template aplica ciertas show-rules para que sea mÃ¡s fÃ¡cil de utilizar. Si quires mÃ¡s personalizaciÃ³n, es probable que necesites desactivarlas y luego solo utilizar las que necesites.

====  Show Rules

El template incluye show rules que pueden ser incluidas opcionalmente. Todas
estas show rules pueden ser activadas agregando:



    #show: minerva.<nombre-funciÃ³n>


Justo despuÃ©s de la lÃ­nea ` #show minerva.report.with( ... ) ` reemplazando
` <nombre-funciÃ³n> ` por el nombre de la show rule a aplicar.

=====  primer-heading-en-nueva-pag (activada por defecto)

Esta show rule hace que el primer heading que tenga ` outlined: true ` se
muestre en una nueva pÃ¡gina (con ` weak: true ` ). Notar que al ser ` weak:
true ` si la pÃ¡gina ya de por si estaba vacÃ­a, no se crea otra pÃ¡gina
adicional, pero para que la pÃ¡gina realmente se considere vacÃ­a no debe
contener absolutamente nada, incluso tener elementos invisibles va a causar
que se agregue una pÃ¡gina extra.

=====  operadores-es (activada por defecto)

Cambia los operadores matemÃ¡ticos que define Typst por defecto a sus
contrapartes en espaÃ±ol, esto es, cambia ` lim ` por ` lÃ­m ` , ` inf ` por `
Ã­nf ` y asÃ­ con todos.

=====  formato-numeros-es

Cambia los nÃºmeros dentro de las ecuaciones para que usen coma decimal en vez
de punto decimal, como es convenciÃ³n en el espaÃ±ol. Esta show rule no viene
activa por defecto.

= *glossy.md*

=  glossy

0.2.0

A very simple glossary system with easily customizable output.

This package provides utilities to manage and render glossaries within
documents. It includes functions to define and use glossary terms, track their
usage, and generate a glossary list with references to where terms are used in
the document.

![image of sample
output](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/glossy/0.2.0/thumbnail.png)

==  Motivation

Glossy is heavily inspired by [ glossarium
](https://typst.app/universe/package/glossarium) , with a few key different
goals:

  1. Provide a simple interface which allows for complete control over glossary display. To do this, ` glossy ` âs ` #glossary() ` function accepts a theme parameter. The goal here is to separate presentation and logic.
  2. Simplify the user interface as much as possible. Glossy has exactly two exports, ` init-glossary ` and ` glossary ` .
  3. Double-down on ` glossy ` âs excellent ` @term ` reference approach, completely eliminating the need to make any calls to ` gls() ` and friends.
  4. Mimic established patterns and best practices. For example, ` glossy ` âs ` #glossary() ` function is intentionally similar (in naming and parameters) to ` typst ` âs built-in ` #bibliography ` , to the degree possible.
  5. Simplify the implementation. The ` glossy ` code is significantly shorter and easier to understand.

==  Features

  - Define glossary terms with short and long forms, descriptions, and grouping
  - Automatically tracks term usage in the document through ` @labels `
  - Supports modifiers to adjust how terms are displayed (capitalize, pluralize, etc.)
  - Generates a formatted glossary section with backlinks to term occurrences
  - Customizable themes for rendering glossary sections, groups, and entries
  - Automatic pluralization of terms with custom override options
  - Page number references back to term usage locations

==  Usage

===  Import the package



    #import "@preview/glossy:0.2.0": *


===  Defining Glossary Terms

Use the ` init-glossary ` function to initialize glossary entries:



    #let myGlossary = (
        html: (
          short: "HTML",
          long: "Hypertext Markup Language",
          description: "A standard language for creating web pages",
          group: "Web"
        ),
        css: (
          short: "CSS",
          long: "Cascading Style Sheets",
          description: "A stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document",
          group: "Web"
        ),
        tps: (
          short: "TPS",
          long: "test procedure specification",
          description: "A formal document describing test steps and expected results",
          // Optional: Override automatic pluralization
          plural: "TPSes",
          longplural: "test procedure specifications"
        )
    )

    #show: init-glossary.with(myGlossary)


Each glossary entry supports the following fields:

  - ` short ` (required): Short form of the term
  - ` long ` (optional): Long form of the term
  - ` description ` (optional): Term description (often a definition)
  - ` group ` (optional): Category grouping
  - ` plural ` (optional): Override automatic pluralization of short form
  - ` longplural ` (optional): Override automatic pluralization of long form

You can also load glossary entries from a data file using #yaml(), #json(), or
similar.

For example, the above glossary could be in this YAML file:



    html:
      short: HTML
      long: Hypertext Markup Language
      description: A standard language for creating web pages
      group: Web

    css:
      short: CSS
      long: Cascading Style Sheets
      description: A stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
      group: Web

    tps:
      short: TPS
      long: test procedure specification
      description: A formal document describing test steps and expected results
      plural: TPSes
      longplural: test procedure specifications


And then loaded during initialization as follows:



    #show: init-glossary.with(yaml("glossary.yaml"))


===  Using Glossary Terms

Reference glossary terms using Typstâs ` @reference ` syntax:



    In modern web development, languages like @html and @css are essential.
    The @tps:pl need to be submitted by Friday.


Available modifiers:

  - *cap* : Capitalizes the term
  - *pl* : Uses the plural form
  - *both* : Shows âLong Form (Short Form)â
  - *short* : Shows only short form
  - *long* : Shows only long form
  - *def* or *desc* : Shows the description

Modifiers can be combined with colons:

*Input* |  *Output*
---|---
` @tps ` (first use)  |  âtest procedure specification (TPS)â
` @tps ` (subsequent)  |  âTPSâ
` @tps:short ` |  âTPSâ
` @tps:long ` |  âtest procedure specificationâ
` @tps:both ` |  âtest procedure specification (TPS)â
` @tps:long:cap ` |  âTest procedure specificationâ
` @tps:long:pl ` |  âtest procedure specificationsâ
` @tps:short:pl ` |  âTPSesâ
` @tps:both:pl:cap ` |  âTechnical procedure specifications (TPSes)â
` @tps:def ` |  âA formal document describing test steps and expected resultsâ

===  Generating the Glossary

Display the glossary using the ` glossary() ` function:



    #glossary(
      title: "Web Development Glossary",
      theme: my-theme,
      groups: ("Web")  // Optional: Filter to specific groups
    )


===  Customizing Term Display

Control how terms appear in the document by providing a custom ` show-term `
function:



    #let emph-term(term-body) = { emph(term-body) }

    #show: init-glossary.with(
      myGlossary,
      show-term: emph-term
    )

        }
        body
      },

      // Individual glossary entry
      entry: (entry, index, total) => {
        // index = entry index, total = total entries in group
        let output = [#entry.short]
        if entry.long != none {
          output = [#output -- #entry.long]
        }
        if entry.description != none {

=  marge

0.1.0

Easy-to-use but powerful and smart margin notes.

A package for easy-to-use but powerful and smart margin notes.

==  Usage

The main function provided by this package is ` sidenote ` , which allows you
to create margin notes. The function takes a single positional argument (the
text of the note) and several optional keyword arguments for customization:

Parameter  |  Description  |  Default
---|---|---
` side ` |  The margin where the note should be placed.  |  ` auto `
` dy ` |  The custom offset by which the note should be moved along the y-axis.  |  ` 0pt `
` padding ` |  The space between the note and the page or content border.  |  ` 2em `
` gap ` |  The minimum gap between this and neighboring notes.  |  ` 0.4em `
` numbering ` |  How the note should be numbered.  |  ` none `
` counter ` |  The counter to use for numbering.  |  ` counter("sidenote") `
` format ` |  The âshow ruleâ for the note.  |  ` it => it.default `

The parameters allow maximum flexibility and often allow values of different
types:

  - The ` side ` parameter can be set to ` auto ` , ` "inside" ` , ` "outside" ` or any horizontal ` alignment ` value. If set to ` auto ` , the note is placed on the larger of the two margins. If they are equally large, it is placed on the ` "outside" ` margin.
  - If the ` dy ` parameter has a relative part, it is resolved relative to the height of the note.
  - The ` padding ` parameter can be set either to a single length value or a dictionary. If a dictionary is used, the keys can be any horizontal alignment value, as well as ` inside ` and ` outside ` .
  - With the ` counter ` parameter, you can for example combine the numbering of footnotes and sidenotes.

An especially useful feature is the ` format ` parameter, as it emulates the
behavior of a show rule via a function. That function is called with the
context of the note and receives a dictionary with the following keys:

Key  |  Description  |  Value or type
---|---|---
` side ` |  The side of the page the note is placed on.  |  ` left ` or ` right `
` numbering ` |  The numbering of the note.  |  ` str ` , ` function ` or ` none `
` counter ` |  The counter used for numbering the note.  |  ` counter `
` padding ` |  The padding of the note, resolved to ` left ` and ` right ` .  |  ` dictionary `
` margin ` |  The size of the margin, which the note is placed on.  |  ` length `
` source ` |  The location in the document where the note is defined.  |  ` location `
` body ` |  The content of the note.  |  ` str `
` default ` |  The default look of the note.  |  ` content `

As the dictionary itself is not an element, you cannot directly use it within
the ` format ` function as you would be able to in a normal show rule. To
still be able to build upon the default look of the note without having to
reconstruct it, the ` default ` key is provided. The default style sets the
font size to ` 0.85em ` and the paragraphâs leading to ` 0.5em ` , matching
the default style of footnotes. This can of course be overridden.

Aside from the customizability, the package also provides automatic overlap
and overflow protection. If a note would overlap with another note, it is
moved further down the page, so that the ` gap ` parameters of both notes are
respected. If a note would overflow the page, it is moved upwards, so that the
bottom of the note is aligned with the bottom of the page content. Any
previous notes, which would then overlap with the moved note, are also moved
accordingly.

===  Note about pages with automatic width

If a note is placed in the right margin of a page with width set to ` auto ` ,
additional configuration is necessary. As the final width of the page is not
known when the note is placed, the noteâs position cannot be calculated. To
place notes on the right margin of such pages, the package provides a `
container ` , which is supposed to be included in the pageâs ` background `
or ` foreground ` :



    #import "@preview/marge:0.1.0": sidenote, container

    #set page(width: auto, background: container)

    ...


The use of the ` container ` variable is detected automatically by the
package, so that an error can be raised when it is required but not set.

===  Note about layout convergence and performance

This package makes heavy use of states and contextual blocks, causing Typst to
require multiple layout passes to fully resolve the final layout. Usually, the
limit imposed by Typst is sufficient, but I cannot guarantee that this will
remain true for large documents with a lot of notes. If you happen to run into
this limit, you can try using the ` container ` variable as mentioned above,
as it can reduce the number of layout passes required.

As each layout iteration adds to the total compile time, the use of the `
container ` can also be beneficial for performance reasons. Another
performance tip is to keep the size of paragraphs containing margin notes
small, as the line breaking algorithm cannot be memoized when the paragraph
contains a note.

===  Note about how lengths are resolved

When a length is given in a context-dependent way (i.e. in ` em ` units), it
is resolved relative to the font size of the _content_ , not the font size of
the note (which is smaller by default). This has the unfortunate side effect
that a gap set to ` 0pt ` will still have some space due to the content
paragraphâs leading (which is also larger than default leading of the note).
Similarly, if notes are defined in a context with a larger font size, the
padding and gap values may unexpectedly be larger than of neighboring notes.

==  Example



    #import "@preview/marge:0.1.0": sidenote

    #set page(margin: (right: 5cm))
    #set par(justify: true)

    #let sidenote = sidenote.with(numbering: "1", padding: 1em)

    The Simpsons is an iconic animated series that began in 1989
    #sidenote[The show holds the record for the most episodes of any
    American sitcom.]. The show features the Simpson family: Homer,
    Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie.

    Bart is the rebellious son who often gets into trouble, and Lisa
    is the intelligent and talented daughter #sidenote[Lisa is known
    for her saxophone playing and academic achievements.]. Baby
    Maggie, though silent, has had moments of surprising brilliance
    #sidenote[Maggie once shot Mr. Burns in a dramatic plot twist.].

Featured  Template

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=charged-ieee&version=0.1.3)

This is a Typst template for a two-column paper from the proceedings of the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The paper is tightly
spaced, fits a lot of content and comes preconfigured for numeric citations
from BibLaTeX or Hayagriva files.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` charged-ieee ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/charged-ieee


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` ieee ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` authors ` : An array of author dictionaries. Each of the author dictionaries must have a ` name ` key and can have the keys ` department ` , ` organization ` , ` location ` , and ` email ` . All keys accept content.
  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or ` none ` . Appears at the top of the first column in boldface.
  - ` index-terms ` : Array of index terms to display after the abstract. Shall be ` content ` .
  - ` paper-size ` : Defaults to ` us-letter ` . Specify a [ paper size string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-paper) to change the page format.
  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the ` bibliography ` function or ` none ` . Specifying this will configure numeric, IEEE-style citations.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
paper.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` ieee `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:

= *nassi.md*

=  nassi

0.1.2

Draw Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams (Struktogramme) with Typst.

*nassi* is a package for [ Typst ](https://typst.app/) to draw [ Nassi-
Shneiderman diagrams
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassi%E2%80%93Shneiderman_diagram)
(Struktogramme).

![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/nassi/0.1.2/assets/example-1.png)

==  Usage

Import *nassi* in your document:



    #import "@preview/nassi:0.1.2"


There are several options to draw diagrams. One is to parse all code-blocks
with the language ânassiâ. Simply add a show-rule like this:



    #import "@preview/nassi:0.1.2"
    #show: nassi.shneiderman()

    ```nassi
    function ggt(a, b)
      while a > 0 and b > 0
        if a > b
          a <- a - b
        else
          b <- b - a
        endif
      endwhile
      if b == 0
        return a
      else
        return b
      endif
    endfunction
    ```


In this case, the diagram is created from a simple pseudocode. To have more
control over the output, you can add blocks manually using the element
functions provided in ` nassi.elements ` :



    #import "@preview/nassi:0.1.2"

    #nassi.diagram({
    	import nassi.elements: *

    	function("ggt(a, b)", {
    		loop("a > b and b > 0", {
    			branch("a > b", {
    				assign("a", "a - b")
    			}, {
    				assign("b", "b - a",
    					fill: gradient.linear(..color.map.rainbow),
    					stroke:red + 2pt
    				)

Since *nassi* uses *cetz* for drawing, you can add diagrams directly to a
canvas. Each block gets a name within the diagram group to reference it in the
drawing:



    #import "@preview/cetz:0.2.2"
    #import "@preview/nassi:0.1.2"

    #cetz.canvas({
      import nassi.draw: diagram
      import nassi.elements: *
      import cetz.draw: *

      diagram((4,4), {
        function("ggt(a, b)", {
          loop("a > b and b > 0", {
            branch("a > b", {
              assign("a", "a - b")
            }, {
              assign("b", "b - a")
            })
          })
          branch("b == 0", { process("return a") }, { process("return b") })
        })
      })

      for i in range(8) {
        content(
          "nassi.e" + str(i+1) + ".north-west",
          stroke:red,
          fill:red.transparentize(50%),
          frame:"circle",
          padding:.05,
          anchor:"north-west",
          text(white, weight:"bold", "e"+str(i)),
        )
      }
    })

      ),
    )
    // Start here

The template will traverse body content, and split it into groups according to
Heading-1 layout. Each group content will be wrapped with ` table.cell ` . So
all content will be wrapped in container, you canât use ` pagebreak() ` in
your body content.

==  Warning

This is not a serious work and may have some rough edges. And reports from
different faculties isnât entirely uniform. Be careful when using it.

*Arguments:*

For all the arguments that take arrays, the arrayâs first item specifies the
value for all level-one entries, the second item for level-two, and so on. The
arrayâs last item will be used for all deeper/following levels as well.

  - ` entry ` : [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The [ ` outline.entry ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/outline/#definitions-entry) element from the show rule.
  - ` font-weight ` : [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) of ( [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or [ ` int ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/int/) or ` auto ` or ` none ` ) â The entryâs font weight. Setting to ` auto ` or ` none ` keeps the contextâs current style.
  - ` font-style ` : [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) of ( [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or ` auto ` or ` none ` ) â The entryâs font style. Setting to ` auto ` or ` none ` keeps the contextâs current style.
  - ` vspace ` : [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) of ( [ ` relative ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/relative/) or [ ` fraction ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/fraction/) or ` none ` ) â Vertical spacing to add above the entry. Setting to ` none ` adds no space.
  - ` font ` : [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) of ( [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) or ` auto ` or ` none ` ) â The entryâs font. Setting to ` auto ` or ` none ` keeps the contextâs current font.
  - ` fill ` : [ ` array ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) of ( [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) or ` auto ` or ` none ` ) â The entryâs fill. Setting to ` auto ` keeps the contextâs current setting.
  - ` fill-right-pad ` : [ ` relative ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/relative/) or ` none ` â Horizontal space to put between the fill and page number.
  - ` fill-align ` : [ ` bool ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) â Whether ` fill-right-pad ` should be relative to the current page number or the widest page number. Setting this to ` true ` has the effect of all fills ending on the same vertical line.
  - ` body-transform ` : [ ` function ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/) or ` none ` â Callback for custom edits to the entryâs body. It gets passed the entryâs level ( [ ` int ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/int/) ) and body ( [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) ) and should return [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) or ` none ` . If ` none ` is returned, no modifications are made.
  - ` page-transform ` : [ ` function ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/) or ` none ` â Callback for custom edits to the entryâs page number. It gets passed the entryâs level ( [ ` int ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/int/) ) and page number ( [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) ) and should return [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) or ` none ` . If ` none ` is returned, no modifications are made.
  - ` label ` : [ ` label ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/label/) â The label to internally use for tracking recursion. This should not need to be modified.
  - ` state-key ` : [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) â The key to use for the internal state which tracks the maximum page number width. The state is global for the entire document and thus applies to all outlines. If you wish to re-calculate the max page number width for ` fill-align ` , then you must provide a different key for each outline.

*Returns:* [ ` content `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/)

===  ` presets `

Presets for the arguments for [ ` show-entry() `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/outrageous/0.3.0/#show-
entry) . You can use them in your show rule with ` #show outline.entry:
outrageous.show-entry.with(..outrageous.presets.outrageous-figures) ` .



    #let presets = (
      // outrageous preset for a Table of Contents
      outrageous-toc: (
        // ...
      ),
      // outrageous preset for List of Figures/Tables/Listings
      outrageous-figures: (
        // ...
      ),
      // preset without any style changes
      typst: (
        // ...
      ),
    )


===  ` repeat `

Utility function to repeat content to fill space with a fixed size gap.



    #let repeat(gap: none, justify: false, body) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` gap ` : [ ` length ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/length/) or ` none ` â The gap between repeated items.
  - ` justify ` : [ ` bool ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) â Whether to increase the gap to justify the items.
  - ` body ` : [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The content to repeat.

*Returns:* [ ` content `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/)

===  ` align-helper `

Utility function to help with aligning multiple items.



    #let align-helper(state-key, what-to-measure, display) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` state-key ` : [ ` str ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) â The key to use for the [ ` state ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/introspection/state/) that keeps track of the maximum encountered width.
  - ` what-to-measure ` : [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) â The content to measure at this call.
  - ` display ` : [ ` function ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/) â A callback which gets passed the maximum encountered width and the width of the current item (what was given to ` what-to-measure ` ), both as [ ` length ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/length/) , and should return [ ` content ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) which can make use of these widths for alignment.

*Returns:* [ ` content `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/)

= *ouset.md*

=  ouset

0.2.0

Package providing over- and underset functions for math mode.

[ GitHub Repository including Examples and Changelog
](https://github.com/ludwig-austermann/typst-ouset)

This is a small package providing over- and underset functions for math mode
in [ typst ](https://typst.app/) .

==  Usage

To use this package simply ` #import "@preview/ouset:0.2.0" ` . To import all
functions use ` : * ` and for specific ones, use either the module or as
described in the [ typst docs
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/scripting#modules) .

The main function provided in this package is ` ouset ` for math environments.
This function can take arbitrary many arguments, but with the following rules:

  - if the first argument is ` & ` , a âalignpointâ is inserted immediately before the symbol
  - next follows the symbol, then the content to put on top, and then the content to put at the bottom
  - if the last argument is ` & ` , a âalignpointâ is inserted immediately after the symbol

There is a named argument ` insert-and ` , which if false, does not insert an
âalignpointâ in the above cases, but only clips at these points.

This package provides furthermore 3 other functions:

  - ` overset(s, t, c: 0, insert-and: true) ` : output the symbol s with t on top of it
  - ` underset(s, b, c: 0 insert-and: true) ` : output the symbol s with b on below of it
  - ` overunderset(s, t, b, c: 0, insert-and: true) ` : output the symbol s with t on top of it and b below it

All functions put enough spacing around the operator, such that other content
does not interfere with it. However, this spacing can be disabled, by setting
` c ` to 1, 2 or 3. This is a flag system with

  - ` c=0 ` : normal spacing on the left and right
  - ` c=1 ` : left spacing is according to the operator / symbol s and right spacing is normal
  - ` c=2 ` : left spacing is normal and right spacing according to the operator / symbol s
  - ` c=3 ` : both spacings are according to the operator / symbol s

Hence: clip param ` c â {0,1,2,3} â {no clip, left clip, right clip, both
clip} `

==  Example usage

Try something like:

  - ` $ouset(-->,, n->oo)$ `
  - ` $ouset(-,1,2)$ `
  *     #import "@preview/ouset:0.2.0": ouset

    $ M &= sum_(k=0)^oo q^k = 1 + q + q^2 + q^3 + q^4 + dots\
        &= 1 + q (1 + q + q^2 + q^3 + dots)\
        ouset(&, =, "Def.", "of" M) 1 + q dot M $

= *tinyset.md*

=  tinyset

0.1.0

Simple, consistent, and appealing math homework template

Extremely simple [ typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) package for writing
math problem sets quickly and consistently. Under the hood it is just typst
fundamentals that could be defined by hand, however the aim of this package is
to make you faster and the code easier to read.

==  Usage

Import styles and create a new header. I like to copy this from the top of the
previous weekâs homework (donât forget to increment the number!).

Example using proof, question, and part environments. Indentation in source
code is largely ignored and left to personal preference. By default questions
are numbered and each part is lettered, you can change this based on course /
instructor preference.



    #import "@preview/tinyset:0.1.0": *
    #header(number: 7, name: "Sylvan Franklin", class: "Math 3551 - Fall 2024")

    + #qs[
    Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be groups, $phi : G_1 -> G_2$ be a homomorphism, and $H$ be
    any subgroup of $G_2$. Define

    $ phi^(-1)(H) = {g in G_1 : phi(g) in H}. $

    + #pt[
        Prove that $phi^(-1)(H)$ is a subgroup of $G_1$.
        #prf[ Non empty: Since $H$ is a subgroup it contains the indentity, and
        since $phi$ is a homomorphism and ... ]
    ]

    + #pt[
        What about a question that you don't need a proof for?
        #ans[Use the ans environment]
    ]

    ]



==  Custom shorthand

Sometimes when thinking about math I find it easier to phonetically write out
these symbols instead of using the built in typst classes. For certain others
I find the original symbols annoying to type quickly.

shorthand  |  expansion
---|---
implies / impl  |  ==>
iff  |  <==>
wlog  |  without loss of generality
inv()  |  ()^(-1)

= *minitoc.md*

=  minitoc

0.1.0

An outline function just for one section and nothing else

This package provides the ` minitoc ` command that does the same thing as the
` outline ` command but only for headings under the heading above it.

This is inspired by minitoc package for LaTeX.

==  Example



    #import "@preview/minitoc:0.1.0": *
    #set heading(numbering: "1.1")

    #outline()

    = Heading 1

    #minitoc()

    == Heading 1.1

    #lorem(20)

    === Heading 1.1.1

    #lorem(30)

    == Heading 1.2

    #lorem(10)

    = Heading 2



This produces

![](https://gitlab.com/human_person/typst-local-
outline/-/raw/main/example/example.png)

==  Usage

The ` minitoc ` function has the following signature:



    #let minitoc(
      title: none, target: heading.where(outlined: true),
    	depth: none, indent: none, fill: repeat([.])
    ) { /* .. */ }


This is designed to be as close to the [ ` outline `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/) funtions as possible. The
arguments are:

  - *title* : The title for the local outline. This is the same as for [ ` outline.title ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/#parameters-title) .
  - *target* : What should be included. This is the same as for [ ` outline.target ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/#parameters-target)
  - *depth* : The maximum depth different to include. For example, if depth was 1 in the example, âHeading 1.1.1â would not be included
  - *indent* : How the entries should be indented. Takes the same types as for [ ` outline.indent ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/#parameters-indent) and is passed directly to it
  - *fill* : Content to put between the numbering and title, and the page number. Same types as for [ ` outline.fill ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/#parameters-fill)

==  Unintended consequences

Because ` minitoc ` uses ` outline ` , if you apply numbering to the title of
outline with ` #show outline: set heading(numbering: "1.") ` or similar, any
title in ` minitoc ` will be numbered and be a level 1 heading. This cannot be
changed with ` #show outline: set heading(level: 3) ` or similar
unfortunately.

= *fontawesome.md*

=  fontawesome

0.5.0

A Typst library for Font Awesome icons through the desktop fonts.

A Typst library for Font Awesome icons through the desktop fonts.

p.s. The library is based on the Font Awesome 6 desktop fonts (v6.6.0)

==  Usage

===  Install the fonts

You can download the fonts from the official website: [
https://fontawesome.com/download ](https://fontawesome.com/download)

After downloading the zip file, you can install the fonts depending on your
OS.

====  Typst web app

You can simply upload the ` otf ` files to the web app and use them with this
package.

====  Mac

You can double click the ` otf ` files to install them.

====  Windows

You can right-click the ` otf ` files and select ` Install ` .

====  Some notes

This library is tested with the otf files of the Font Awesome Free set.
TrueType fonts may not work as expected. (Though I am not sure whether Font
Awesome provides TrueType fonts, some issue is reported with TrueType fonts.)

===  Import the library

====  Using the typst packages

You can install the library using the typst packages:

` #import "@preview/fontawesome:0.5.0": * `

====  Manually install

Copy all files start with ` lib ` to your project and import the library:

` #import "lib.typ": * `

There are three files:

  - ` lib.typ ` : The main entrypoint of the library.
  - ` lib-impl.typ ` : The implementation of ` fa-icon ` .
  - ` lib-gen.typ ` : The generated icon map and functions.

I recommend renaming these files to avoid conflicts with other libraries.

===  Use the icons

You can use the ` fa-icon ` function to create an icon with its name:

` #fa-icon("chess-queen") `

Or you can use the ` fa- ` prefix to create an icon with its name:

` #fa-chess-queen() ` (This is equivalent to ` #fa-icon().with("chess-queen")
` )

You can also set ` solid ` to ` true ` to use the solid version of the icon:

` #fa-icon("chess-queen", solid: true) `

Some icons only have the solid version in the Free set, so you need to set `
solid ` to ` true ` to use them if you are using the Free set. Otherwise, you
may not get the expected glyph.

====  Full list of icons

You can find all icons on the [ official website
](https://fontawesome.com/search)

====  Different sets

By default, the library supports ` Free ` , ` Brands ` , ` Pro ` , ` Duotone `
and ` Sharp ` sets. (See [ Enable Pro sets
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/fontawesome/0.5.0/#enable-
pro-sets) for enabling Pro sets.)

But only ` Free ` and ` Brands ` are tested by me. That is, three font files
are used to test:

  - Font Awesome 6 Free (Also named as _Font Awesome 6 Free Regular_ )
  - Font Awesome 6 Free Solid
  - Font Awesome 6 Brands

Due to some limitations of typst 0.12.0, the regular and solid versions are
treated as different fonts. In this library, ` solid ` is used to switch
between the regular and solid versions.

To use other sets or specify one set, you can pass the ` font ` parameter to
the inner ` text ` function:
` fa-icon("github", font: "Font Awesome 6 Pro Solid") `

If you have Font Awesome Pro, please help me test the library with the Pro
set. Any feedback is appreciated.

=====  Enable Pro sets

Typst 0.12.0 raise a warning when the font is not found. To use the Pro set, `
#fa-use-pro() ` should be called before any ` fa-* ` functions.



    #fa-use-pro()                 // Enable Pro sets

    #fa-icon("chess-queen-piece") // Use icons from Pro sets


====  Customization

The ` fa-icon ` function passes args to ` text ` , so you can customize the
icon by passing parameters to it:

` #fa-icon("chess-queen", fill: blue) `

====  Stacking icons

The ` fa-stack ` function can be used to create stacked icons:

` #fa-stack(fa-icon-args: (solid: true), "square", ("chess-queen", (fill:
white, size: 5.5pt))) `

Declaration is ` fa-stack(box-args: (:), grid-args: (:), fa-icon-args: (:),
..icons) `

  - The order of the icons is from the bottom to the top.
  - ` fa-icon-args ` is used to set the default args for all icons.
  - You can also control the internal ` box ` and ` grid ` by passing the ` box-args ` and ` grid-args ` to the ` fa-stack ` function.
  - Currently, four types of icons are supported. The first three types leverage the ` fa-icon ` function, and the last type is just a content you want to put in the stack.
    - ` str ` , e.g., ` "square" `
    - ` array ` , e.g., ` ("chess-queen", (fill: white, size: 5.5pt)) `
    - ` arguments ` , e.g. ` arguments("chess-queen", solid: true, fill: white) `
    - ` content ` , e.g. ` fa-chess-queen(solid: true, fill: white) `

====  Known Issues

  - [ typst#2578 ](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2578) [ typst-fontawesome#2 ](https://github.com/duskmoon314/typst-fontawesome/issues/2)

This is a known issue that the ligatures may not work in headings, list items,
grid items, and other elements. You can use the Unicode from the [ official
website ](https://fontawesome.com/) to avoid this issue when using Pro sets.

For most icons, Unicode is used implicitly. So I assume we usually donât
need to worry about this.

Any help on this issue is appreciated.

==  Example

See the [ ` example.typ ` ](https://typst.app/project/rQwGUWt5p33vrsb_uNPR9F)
file for a complete example.

==  Contribution

Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you find any problems or have
any suggestions.

===  Python helper

The ` helper.py ` script is used to get metadata via the GraphQL API and
generate typst code. I aim only to use standard python libraries, so running
it on any platform with python installed should be easy.

===  Repo structure

  - ` helper.py ` : The helper script to get metadata and generate typst code.
  - ` lib.typ ` : The main entrypoint of the library.
  - ` lib-impl.typ ` : The implementation of ` fa-icon ` .
  - ` lib-gen.typ ` : The generated functions of icons.
  - ` example.typ ` : An example file to show how to use the library.
  - ` gallery.typ ` : The generated gallery of icons. It is used in the example file.

==  License

This library is licensed under the MIT license. Feel free to use it in your
project.

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` fontawesome `



    #import "@preview/fontawesome:0.5.0"

= *genealotree.md*

=  genealotree

0.1.0

A package to draw genealogical trees, based on CeTZ

Genealotree is a typst package to draw genealogical trees. It is developped at
[ https://codeberg.org/drloiseau/genealogy
](https://codeberg.org/drloiseau/genealogy) . This is the place you can get
the developpement version and send issues and pull requests.

![Example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/genealotree/0.1.0/examples/example.jpg)

This package is based on [ CeTZ
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/genealotree/0.1.0/%22https://typst.app/universe/package/cetz/%22)
and it provides functions to draw genealogical trees. It is oriented towards
medical genealogy to study genetic disorders inheritance, but you might be
able to use it to draw your family tree.

*Features :*

  - Draw an unlimited number of independant genealogical trees
  - Supports consanguinity and unions between different trees (see limitations)
  - Auto adjusts position of children to optimize spacing
  - Customize all lengths
  - Draw as much phenotypes as needed by coloring individuals
  - Print genotype and/or phenotype labels under individuals

*Limitations :*

  - Must manually adjust individual position in the tree when drawing consanguinity and unions between trees to prevent overlapping of individuals.
  - No remarriages (might be added in a future version)
  - No union between individuals at different generations (might be added in a future version)

*To be implemented :*

  - Allow to pass CeTZ arguments to every elements to cutomize their appearance
  - Draw optional legends for tree symbols and for phenotypes

See example.typ for a simple usage example, and the manual for precise
references at [ manual.pdf
](https://codeberg.org/attachments/cfdad2b7-52ae-4e18-8d7b-453fadc45532)

The steps to produce a tree are :

  - Import the package and CeTZ



    #import "@preview/genealotree:0.1.0": *
    #import "@preview/cetz:0.2.2": canvas


  - Create a genealogy object



    let my-geneal = genealogy-init()


  - Add persons to the object : pass a dictionary mapping a persons name with a dictionary describing its characteristics. See the manual for a full reference.



    let my-geneal = add-persons(
      my-geneal,
      (
        "I1": (sex: "m"),
        "I2": (sex: "f"),
        "II1": (sex: "f"),
      )
    )


  - Set unions between persons : give the parents names as an array of 2 strings, and the children names as an array of strings.



    let my-geneal = add-unions(
      my-geneal,
      (("I1", "I2"), ("II1",))
    )


  - Open up a CeTZ canva and draw the tree



    #canvas(length: 0.4cm, {
        draw-tree(my-geneal)
    })


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` genealotree `



    #import "@preview/genealotree:0.1.0"

to see how it looks.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` pesha ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/pesha


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` pesha ` function with the following named
arguments:

Argument  |  Type  |  Description
---|---|---
` name ` |  [ string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) |  A string to specify the authorâs name.
` address ` |  [ string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) |  A string to specify the authorâs address.
` contacts ` |  [ array ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/) |  An array of content to specify your contact information. E.g., phone number, email, LinkedIn, etc.
` profile-picture ` |  [ content ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) |  The result of a call to the [ image function ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/image/) or ` none ` . For best result, make sure that your image has an 1:1 aspect ratio.
` paper-size ` |  [ string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) |  Specify a [ paper size string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page#parameters-paper) to change the page size (default is ` a4 ` ).
` footer-text ` |  [ content ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/content/) |  Content that will be prepended to the page numbering in the footer.
` page-numbering-format ` |  [ string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) |  [ Pattern ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/numbering/#parameters-numbering) that will be used for displaying page numbering in the footer (default is ` 1 of 1 ` ).

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` pesha `
function in a show rule. If you, however, want to change an existing project
to use this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your
file:



    #import "@preview/pesha:0.4.0": *

    #show: pesha.with(
      name: "Max Mustermann",
      address: "5419 Hollywood Blvd Ste c731, Los Angeles, CA 90027",
      contacts: (
        [(323) 555 1435],
        [#link("mailto:max@mustermann.com")],
      ),
      paper-size: "us-letter",
      footer-text: [Mustermann RÃ©sumÃ© ---]
    )

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=minerva-report-fcfm&version=0.2.1)

Template para hacer tareas, informes y trabajos, para estudiantes y
acadÃ©micos de la Facultad de Ciencias FÃ­sicas y MatemÃ¡ticas de la
Universidad de Chile que han usado templates similares para LaTeX.

==  GuÃ­a RÃ¡pida

===  [ Webapp ](https://typst.app/)

Si utilizas la webapp de Typst puedes presionar âStart from templateâ y
buscar âminerva-report-fcfmâ para crear un nuevo proyecto con este
template.

===  Typst CLI

Teniendo el CLI con la versiÃ³n 0.11.0 o mayor, puedes realizar:



    typst init @preview/minerva-report-fcfm:0.2.1


Esto va a descargar el template en la cache de typst y luego va a iniciar el
proyecto en la carpeta actual.

==  ConfiguraciÃ³n

La mayorÃ­a de la configuraciÃ³n se realiza a travÃ©s del archivo ` meta.typ `
, allÃ­ podrÃ¡s elegir un tÃ­tulo, indicar los autores, el equipo docente,
entre otras configuraciones.

El campo ` autores ` solo puede ser ` string ` o un ` array ` de strings.

La configuraciÃ³n ` departamento ` puede ser personalizada a cualquier
organizaciÃ³n pasandole un diccionario de esta forma:



    #let departamento = (
      nombre: (
        "Universidad TÃ©cnica Federico Santa MarÃ­a",
      )
    )


Las demÃ¡s configuraciones pueden ser un ` content ` arbitrario, o un ` string
` .

===  ConfiguraciÃ³n Avanzada

Algunos aspectos mÃ¡s avanzados pueden ser configurados a travÃ©s de la show
rule que inicializa el documento ` #show: minerva.report.with( ... ) ` , los
parÃ¡metros opcionales que recibe la funciÃ³n ` report ` son los siguientes:

nombre  |  tipo  |  descriciÃ³n
---|---|---
portada  |  (meta) => content  |  Una funciÃ³n que recibe el diccionario ` meta.typ ` y retorna una pÃ¡gina.
header  |  (meta) => content  |  Header a aplicarse a cada pÃ¡gina.
footer  |  (meta) => content  |  Footer a aplicarse a cada pÃ¡gina.
showrules  |  bool  |  El template aplica ciertas show-rules para que sea mÃ¡s fÃ¡cil de utilizar. Si quires mÃ¡s personalizaciÃ³n, es probable que necesites desactivarlas y luego solo utilizar las que necesites.

====  Show Rules

El template incluye show rules que pueden ser incluidas opcionalmente. Todas
estas show rules pueden ser activadas agregando:



    #show: minerva.<nombre-funciÃ³n>


Justo despuÃ©s de la lÃ­nea ` #show minerva.report.with( ... ) ` reemplazando
` <nombre-funciÃ³n> ` por el nombre de la show rule a aplicar.

=====  primer-heading-en-nueva-pag (activada por defecto)

Esta show rule hace que el primer heading que tenga ` outlined: true ` se
muestre en una nueva pÃ¡gina (con ` weak: true ` ). Notar que al ser ` weak:
true ` si la pÃ¡gina ya de por si estaba vacÃ­a, no se crea otra pÃ¡gina
adicional, pero para que la pÃ¡gina realmente se considere vacÃ­a no debe
contener absolutamente nada, incluso tener elementos invisibles va a causar
que se agregue una pÃ¡gina extra.

=====  operadores-es (activada por defecto)

Cambia los operadores matemÃ¡ticos que define Typst por defecto a sus
contrapartes en espaÃ±ol, esto es, cambia ` lim ` por ` lÃ­m ` , ` inf ` por `
Ã­nf ` y asÃ­ con todos.

=====  formato-numeros-es

Cambia los nÃºmeros dentro de las ecuaciones para que usen coma decimal en vez
de punto decimal, como es convenciÃ³n en el espaÃ±ol. Esta show rule no viene
activa por defecto.

= *glossy.md*

=  glossy

0.2.0

A very simple glossary system with easily customizable output.

This package provides utilities to manage and render glossaries within
documents. It includes functions to define and use glossary terms, track their
usage, and generate a glossary list with references to where terms are used in
the document.

![image of sample
output](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/glossy/0.2.0/thumbnail.png)

==  Motivation

Glossy is heavily inspired by [ glossarium
](https://typst.app/universe/package/glossarium) , with a few key different
goals:

  1. Provide a simple interface which allows for complete control over glossary display. To do this, ` glossy ` âs ` #glossary() ` function accepts a theme parameter. The goal here is to separate presentation and logic.
  2. Simplify the user interface as much as possible. Glossy has exactly two exports, ` init-glossary ` and ` glossary ` .
  3. Double-down on ` glossy ` âs excellent ` @term ` reference approach, completely eliminating the need to make any calls to ` gls() ` and friends.
  4. Mimic established patterns and best practices. For example, ` glossy ` âs ` #glossary() ` function is intentionally similar (in naming and parameters) to ` typst ` âs built-in ` #bibliography ` , to the degree possible.
  5. Simplify the implementation. The ` glossy ` code is significantly shorter and easier to understand.

==  Features

  - Define glossary terms with short and long forms, descriptions, and grouping
  - Automatically tracks term usage in the document through ` @labels `
  - Supports modifiers to adjust how terms are displayed (capitalize, pluralize, etc.)
  - Generates a formatted glossary section with backlinks to term occurrences
  - Customizable themes for rendering glossary sections, groups, and entries
  - Automatic pluralization of terms with custom override options
  - Page number references back to term usage locations

==  Usage

===  Import the package



    #import "@preview/glossy:0.2.0": *


===  Defining Glossary Terms

Use the ` init-glossary ` function to initialize glossary entries:



    #let myGlossary = (
        html: (
          short: "HTML",
          long: "Hypertext Markup Language",
          description: "A standard language for creating web pages",
          group: "Web"
        ),
        css: (
          short: "CSS",
          long: "Cascading Style Sheets",
          description: "A stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document",
          group: "Web"
        ),
        tps: (
          short: "TPS",
          long: "test procedure specification",
          description: "A formal document describing test steps and expected results",
          // Optional: Override automatic pluralization
          plural: "TPSes",
          longplural: "test procedure specifications"
        )
    )

    #show: init-glossary.with(myGlossary)


Each glossary entry supports the following fields:

  - ` short ` (required): Short form of the term
  - ` long ` (optional): Long form of the term
  - ` description ` (optional): Term description (often a definition)
  - ` group ` (optional): Category grouping
  - ` plural ` (optional): Override automatic pluralization of short form
  - ` longplural ` (optional): Override automatic pluralization of long form

You can also load glossary entries from a data file using #yaml(), #json(), or
similar.

For example, the above glossary could be in this YAML file:



    html:
      short: HTML
      long: Hypertext Markup Language
      description: A standard language for creating web pages
      group: Web

    css:
      short: CSS
      long: Cascading Style Sheets
      description: A stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
      group: Web

    tps:
      short: TPS
      long: test procedure specification
      description: A formal document describing test steps and expected results
      plural: TPSes
      longplural: test procedure specifications


And then loaded during initialization as follows:



    #show: init-glossary.with(yaml("glossary.yaml"))


===  Using Glossary Terms

Reference glossary terms using Typstâs ` @reference ` syntax:



    In modern web development, languages like @html and @css are essential.
    The @tps:pl need to be submitted by Friday.


Available modifiers:

  - *cap* : Capitalizes the term
  - *pl* : Uses the plural form
  - *both* : Shows âLong Form (Short Form)â
  - *short* : Shows only short form
  - *long* : Shows only long form
  - *def* or *desc* : Shows the description

Modifiers can be combined with colons:

*Input* |  *Output*
---|---
` @tps ` (first use)  |  âtest procedure specification (TPS)â
` @tps ` (subsequent)  |  âTPSâ
` @tps:short ` |  âTPSâ
` @tps:long ` |  âtest procedure specificationâ
` @tps:both ` |  âtest procedure specification (TPS)â
` @tps:long:cap ` |  âTest procedure specificationâ
` @tps:long:pl ` |  âtest procedure specificationsâ
` @tps:short:pl ` |  âTPSesâ
` @tps:both:pl:cap ` |  âTechnical procedure specifications (TPSes)â
` @tps:def ` |  âA formal document describing test steps and expected resultsâ

===  Generating the Glossary

Display the glossary using the ` glossary() ` function:



    #glossary(
      title: "Web Development Glossary",
      theme: my-theme,
      groups: ("Web")  // Optional: Filter to specific groups
    )


===  Customizing Term Display

Control how terms appear in the document by providing a custom ` show-term `
function:



    #let emph-term(term-body) = { emph(term-body) }

    #show: init-glossary.with(
      myGlossary,
      show-term: emph-term
    )


===  Glossary Themes

0.1.0

Easy-to-use but powerful and smart margin notes.

A package for easy-to-use but powerful and smart margin notes.

==  Usage

The main function provided by this package is ` sidenote ` , which allows you
to create margin notes. The function takes a single positional argument (the
text of the note) and several optional keyword arguments for customization:

Parameter  |  Description  |  Default
---|---|---
` side ` |  The margin where the note should be placed.  |  ` auto `
` dy ` |  The custom offset by which the note should be moved along the y-axis.  |  ` 0pt `
` padding ` |  The space between the note and the page or content border.  |  ` 2em `
` gap ` |  The minimum gap between this and neighboring notes.  |  ` 0.4em `
` numbering ` |  How the note should be numbered.  |  ` none `
` counter ` |  The counter to use for numbering.  |  ` counter("sidenote") `
` format ` |  The âshow ruleâ for the note.  |  ` it => it.default `

The parameters allow maximum flexibility and often allow values of different
types:

  - The ` side ` parameter can be set to ` auto ` , ` "inside" ` , ` "outside" ` or any horizontal ` alignment ` value. If set to ` auto ` , the note is placed on the larger of the two margins. If they are equally large, it is placed on the ` "outside" ` margin.
  - If the ` dy ` parameter has a relative part, it is resolved relative to the height of the note.
  - The ` padding ` parameter can be set either to a single length value or a dictionary. If a dictionary is used, the keys can be any horizontal alignment value, as well as ` inside ` and ` outside ` .
  - With the ` counter ` parameter, you can for example combine the numbering of footnotes and sidenotes.

An especially useful feature is the ` format ` parameter, as it emulates the
behavior of a show rule via a function. That function is called with the
context of the note and receives a dictionary with the following keys:

Key  |  Description  |  Value or type
---|---|---
` side ` |  The side of the page the note is placed on.  |  ` left ` or ` right `
` numbering ` |  The numbering of the note.  |  ` str ` , ` function ` or ` none `
` counter ` |  The counter used for numbering the note.  |  ` counter `
` padding ` |  The padding of the note, resolved to ` left ` and ` right ` .  |  ` dictionary `
` margin ` |  The size of the margin, which the note is placed on.  |  ` length `
` source ` |  The location in the document where the note is defined.  |  ` location `
` body ` |  The content of the note.  |  ` str `
` default ` |  The default look of the note.  |  ` content `

As the dictionary itself is not an element, you cannot directly use it within
the ` format ` function as you would be able to in a normal show rule. To
still be able to build upon the default look of the note without having to
reconstruct it, the ` default ` key is provided. The default style sets the
font size to ` 0.85em ` and the paragraphâs leading to ` 0.5em ` , matching
the default style of footnotes. This can of course be overridden.

Aside from the customizability, the package also provides automatic overlap
and overflow protection. If a note would overlap with another note, it is
moved further down the page, so that the ` gap ` parameters of both notes are
respected. If a note would overflow the page, it is moved upwards, so that the
bottom of the note is aligned with the bottom of the page content. Any
previous notes, which would then overlap with the moved note, are also moved
accordingly.

===  Note about pages with automatic width

If a note is placed in the right margin of a page with width set to ` auto ` ,
additional configuration is necessary. As the final width of the page is not
known when the note is placed, the noteâs position cannot be calculated. To
place notes on the right margin of such pages, the package provides a `
container ` , which is supposed to be included in the pageâs ` background `
or ` foreground ` :



    #import "@preview/marge:0.1.0": sidenote, container

    #set page(width: auto, background: container)

    ...


The use of the ` container ` variable is detected automatically by the
package, so that an error can be raised when it is required but not set.

===  Note about layout convergence and performance

This package makes heavy use of states and contextual blocks, causing Typst to
require multiple layout passes to fully resolve the final layout. Usually, the
limit imposed by Typst is sufficient, but I cannot guarantee that this will
remain true for large documents with a lot of notes. If you happen to run into
this limit, you can try using the ` container ` variable as mentioned above,
as it can reduce the number of layout passes required.

As each layout iteration adds to the total compile time, the use of the `
container ` can also be beneficial for performance reasons. Another
performance tip is to keep the size of paragraphs containing margin notes
small, as the line breaking algorithm cannot be memoized when the paragraph
contains a note.

===  Note about how lengths are resolved

When a length is given in a context-dependent way (i.e. in ` em ` units), it
is resolved relative to the font size of the _content_ , not the font size of
the note (which is smaller by default). This has the unfortunate side effect
that a gap set to ` 0pt ` will still have some space due to the content
paragraphâs leading (which is also larger than default leading of the note).
Similarly, if notes are defined in a context with a larger font size, the
padding and gap values may unexpectedly be larger than of neighboring notes.

==  Example



    #import "@preview/marge:0.1.0": sidenote

    #set page(margin: (right: 5cm))
    #set par(justify: true)

    #let sidenote = sidenote.with(numbering: "1", padding: 1em)

    The Simpsons is an iconic animated series that began in 1989
    #sidenote[The show holds the record for the most episodes of any
    American sitcom.]. The show features the Simpson family: Homer,
    Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie.

    Bart is the rebellious son who often gets into trouble, and Lisa
    is the intelligent and talented daughter #sidenote[Lisa is known
    for her saxophone playing and academic achievements.]. Baby
    Maggie, though silent, has had moments of surprising brilliance
    #sidenote[Maggie once shot Mr. Burns in a dramatic plot twist.].

0.1.3

An IEEE-style paper template to publish at conferences and journals for
Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Computer Engineering

Featured  Template

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=charged-ieee&version=0.1.3)

This is a Typst template for a two-column paper from the proceedings of the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The paper is tightly
spaced, fits a lot of content and comes preconfigured for numeric citations
from BibLaTeX or Hayagriva files.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` charged-ieee ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/charged-ieee


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` ieee ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` authors ` : An array of author dictionaries. Each of the author dictionaries must have a ` name ` key and can have the keys ` department ` , ` organization ` , ` location ` , and ` email ` . All keys accept content.
  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or ` none ` . Appears at the top of the first column in boldface.
  - ` index-terms ` : Array of index terms to display after the abstract. Shall be ` content ` .
  - ` paper-size ` : Defaults to ` us-letter ` . Specify a [ paper size string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-paper) to change the page format.
  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the ` bibliography ` function or ` none ` . Specifying this will configure numeric, IEEE-style citations.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
paper.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` ieee `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:

        The process of scientific writing is often tangled up with the intricacies of typesetting, leading to frustration and wasted time for researchers. In this paper, we introduce Typst, a new typesetting system designed specifically for scientific writing. Typst untangles the typesetting process, allowing researchers to compose papers faster. In a series of experiments we demonstrate that Typst offers several advantages, including faster document creation, simplified syntax, and increased ease-of-use.

= *nassi.md*

=  nassi

0.1.2

Draw Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams (Struktogramme) with Typst.

*nassi* is a package for [ Typst ](https://typst.app/) to draw [ Nassi-
Shneiderman diagrams
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassi%E2%80%93Shneiderman_diagram)
(Struktogramme).

![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/nassi/0.1.2/assets/example-1.png)

==  Usage

Import *nassi* in your document:



    #import "@preview/nassi:0.1.2"


There are several options to draw diagrams. One is to parse all code-blocks
with the language ânassiâ. Simply add a show-rule like this:



    #import "@preview/nassi:0.1.2"
    #show: nassi.shneiderman()

    ```nassi
    function ggt(a, b)
      while a > 0 and b > 0
        if a > b
          a <- a - b
        else
          b <- b - a
        endif
      endwhile
      if b == 0
        return a
      else
        return b
      endif
    endfunction
    ```


In this case, the diagram is created from a simple pseudocode. To have more
control over the output, you can add blocks manually using the element
functions provided in ` nassi.elements ` :



    #import "@preview/nassi:0.1.2"

    #nassi.diagram({
    	import nassi.elements: *

    	function("ggt(a, b)", {
    		loop("a > b and b > 0", {
    			branch("a > b", {
    				assign("a", "a - b")
    			}, {
    				assign("b", "b - a",
    					fill: gradient.linear(..color.map.rainbow),
    					stroke:red + 2pt
    				)
    			})
    		})
    		branch("b == 0", { process("return a") }, { process("return b") })
    	})
    })


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/nassi/0.1.2/assets/example-3.png)

Since *nassi* uses *cetz* for drawing, you can add diagrams directly to a
canvas. Each block gets a name within the diagram group to reference it in the
drawing:



    #import "@preview/cetz:0.2.2"
    #import "@preview/nassi:0.1.2"

    #cetz.canvas({
      import nassi.draw: diagram
      import nassi.elements: *
      import cetz.draw: *

      diagram((4,4), {
        function("ggt(a, b)", {
          loop("a > b and b > 0", {
            branch("a > b", {
              assign("a", "a - b")
            }, {
              assign("b", "b - a")
            })
          })
          branch("b == 0", { process("return a") }, { process("return b") })
        })
      })

      for i in range(8) {
        content(
          "nassi.e" + str(i+1) + ".north-west",
          stroke:red,
          fill:red.transparentize(50%),
          frame:"circle",
          padding:.05,
          anchor:"north-west",
          text(white, weight:"bold", "e"+str(i)),
        )
      }
    })


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/nassi/0.1.2/assets/example-
cetz-2.png)

This can be useful to annotate a diagram:

      course-title: [å»é¸¡å­¦ä¹ ],
      experiment-title: [å»é¸¡],
      faculty: [å»é¸¡å­¦é¢],

      experiment-date: datetime(year: 1983, month: 9, day: 27),
      features: (
        "Bibliography": "template/refs.bib",
      ),
    )
    // Start here


Features:

  1. ` Bibliography ` : Bibliography file path.
  2. ` FontFamily ` : Custom font family. Default: ` ("Noto Serif", "Noto Serif CJK SC") `

The template will traverse body content, and split it into groups according to
Heading-1 layout. Each group content will be wrapped with ` table.cell ` . So
all content will be wrapped in container, you canât use ` pagebreak() ` in
your body content.

==  Warning

This is not a serious work and may have some rough edges. And reports from
different faculties isnât entirely uniform. Be careful when using it.

= *prooftrees.md*

=  prooftrees

0.1.0

Proof trees for natural deduction and type theories

This package is for constructing proof trees in the style of natural deduction
or the sequent calculus, for ` typst ` ` 0.7.0 ` . Please do open issues for
bugs etc :)

Features:

  - Inferences can have arbitrarily many premises.
  - Inference lines can have left and/or right labelsÂ¹
  - ConfigurableÂ² per tree and per line: premise spacing, the line stroke, etcâ¦ .
  - Theyâre proof trees.

Â¹ The placement of labels is currently very primitive, and requires much user
intervention.

Â² Options are quite limited.

==  Usage

The user interface is inspired by [ bussproof
](https://ctan.org/pkg/bussproofs) âs; a tree is constructed by a sequence
of âlinesâ that state their number of premises. [ ` src/prooftrees.typ `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/prooftrees/0.1.0/src/prooftrees.typ)
contains the documentation and the main functions needed.

The code for some example trees can be seen in ` examples/prooftree_test.typ `
.

===  Examples

A single inference would be:



    #import "@preview/prooftrees:0.1.0"

    #prooftree.tree(
        prooftree.axi[$A => A$],
        prooftree.uni[$A => A, B$]
    )


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/david-davies/typst-
prooftree/main/examples/Example1.png)

A more interesting example:



    #import "@preview/prooftrees:0.1.0"

    #prooftree.tree(
        prooftree.axi[$B => B$],
        prooftree.uni[$B => B, A$],
        prooftree.uni[$B => A, B$],
            prooftree.axi[$A => A$],
            prooftree.uni[$A => A, B$],
        prooftree.bin[$B => A, B$]
    )


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/david-davies/typst-
prooftree/main/examples/Example2.png)

An n-ary inference can be made:



    #import "@preview/prooftrees:0.1.0"

    #prooftrees.tree(
        prooftrees.axi(pad(bottom: 2pt, [$P_1$])),
        prooftrees.axi(pad(bottom: 2pt, [$P_2$])),
        prooftrees.axi(pad(bottom: 2pt, [$P_3$])),
        prooftrees.axi(pad(bottom: 2pt, [$P_4$])),
        prooftrees.axi(pad(bottom: 2pt, [$P_5$])),
        prooftrees.axi(pad(bottom: 2pt, [$P_6$])),
        prooftrees.nary(6)[$C$],
    )


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/david-davies/typst-
prooftree/main/examples/Example3.png)

==  Known Issues:

===  Superscripts and subscripts clip with the line

The boundaries of blocks containing math do not expand enough for
sub/pscripts; I think this is a typst issue. Short-term fix: add manual vspace
or padding in the cell.

==  Implementation

The placement of the line and conclusion is calculated using ` measure ` on
the premises and labels, and doing geometric arithmetic with these values.

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` prooftrees `



    #import "@preview/prooftrees:0.1.0"

0.1.0

An unofficial template for a thesis at the TU Wien informatics institute.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=definitely-not-tuw-
thesis&version=0.1.0)

An example thesis can be viewed here: [ https://otto-aa.github.io/definitely-
not-tuw-thesis/thesis.pdf ](https://otto-aa.github.io/definitely-not-tuw-
thesis/thesis.pdf)

==  Usage

You can download the template with:



    typst init @preview/definitely-not-tuw-thesis


===  Template overview

After setting up the template, you will have the following files:

  - ` thesis.typ ` : overall structure and styling, configuration for the cover pages and PDF metadata
  - ` content/front-matter.typ ` : acknowledgments and abstract
  - ` content/main.typ ` : all your chapters
  - ` content/appendix.typ ` : AI tools acknowledgment and other appendices
  - ` refs.bib ` : references

Then copy the values you get from compiling the [ official template
](https://gitlab.com/ThomasAUZINGER/vutinfth) , and paste them in ` thesis.typ
` . Remove all unused fields and, finally, compare if it is close enough to
the official template. If not, please open an issue or PR to fix it.

===  Styling

If you want to adapt the styling, you can remove the ` show: ... ` commands in
the ` thesis.typ ` and replace them with your own, or simply extend them with
your own ` show: ... ` commands.

==  Contributing

I guess there are many ways to improve this template, feel free to do so and
submit issues and PRs! More information at [ CONTRIBUTING.md
](https://github.com/Otto-AA/unofficial-tu-wien-thesis-

= *fractusist.md*

=  fractusist

0.1.0

Create a variety of wonderful fractals in Typst.

Create a variety of wonderful fractals in Typst.

==  Examples

The example below creates a dragon curve of the 12th iteration with the `
dragon-curve ` function.

![The rendered dragon
curve](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/fractusist/0.1.0/examples/dragon-
curve-n12.png)

Show code



    #set page(width: auto, height: auto, margin: 0pt)

    #dragon-curve(
      12,
      step-size: 6,
      stroke-style: stroke(
        paint: gradient.linear(..color.map.crest, angle: 45deg),
        thickness: 3pt,
        cap: "square"
      )
    )


==  Features

  - Use SVG backend for image rendering.
  - Generate fractals using [ L-system ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) .
  - The number of iterations, step size, fill and stroke styles, etc. of generated fractals could be customized.

==  Usage

Import the latest version of this package with:



    #import "@preview/fractusist:0.1.0": *


Each function generates a specific fractal. The input and output arguments of
all functions have a similar style. Typical input arguments are as follows:

  - ` n ` : the number of iterations ( *the valid range of values depends on the specific function* ).
  - _` step-size ` _ : step size (in pt).
  - _` fill-style ` _ : fill style, can be ` none ` or color or gradient ( *exists only when the curve is closed* ).
  - _` stroke-style ` _ : stroke style, can be ` none ` or color or gradient or stroke object.
  - _` width ` _ : the width of the image.
  - _` height ` _ : the height of the image.
  - _` fit ` _ : how the image should adjust itself to a given area, âcoverâ / âcontainâ / âstretchâ.

The content returned is the ` image ` element.

For more codes with these functions see [ tests
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/fractusist/0.1.0/tests)
.

= *scholarly-tauthesis.md*

![A preview of the scholarly-tauthesis Typst
template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/scholarly-
tauthesis-0.9.0-small.webp)

=  scholarly-tauthesis

0.9.0

A template for writing Tampere University theses.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=scholarly-tauthesis&version=0.9.0)

This is a TAU thesis template written in the [ ` typst `
](https://github.com/typst/typst) typesetting language, a potential successor
to LaTeÎ§. The version of typst used to test this template is [ ` 0.12.0 `
](https://github.com/typst/typst/releases/tag/v0.12.0) .

==  Using the template on typst.app

This template is also available on [ Typst Universe
](https://typst.app/universe) as [ ` scholarly-tauthesis `
](https://typst.app/universe/package/scholarly-tauthesis) . Simply create an
account on [ https://typst.app/ ](https://typst.app/) and start a new `
scholarly-tauthesis ` project by clicking on *Start from template* and
searching for *scholarly-tauthesis* .

If you have initialized your project with an older stable version of this
template and wish to upgrade to a newer release, the simplest way to do it is
to change the value of ` $VERSION ` â¥ ` 0.9.0 ` in the import statements



    #import "@preview/scholarly-tauthesis:$VERSION" as tauthesis


to correspond to a newer released version. Alternatively, you could download
the ` tauthesis.typ ` file from the [ thesis template repository
](https://gitlab.com/tuni-official/thesis-templates/tau-typst-thesis-template)
, and upload it into you project on [ https://typst.app/ ](https://typst.app/)
. Then use



    #import "path/to/tauthesis.typ" as tauthesis


instead of



    #import "@preview/scholarly-tauthesis:$VERSION" as tauthesis


to import the ` tauthesis ` module.

===  Note

Versions of this template before 0.9.0 do not actually work with typst.app due
to a packaging issue.

==  Local installation

If [ Typst Universe ](https://typst.app/universe) is online, this template
will be downloaded automatically to



    $CACHEDIR/typst/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/$VERSION/


when one runs the command



    typst init @preview/scholarly-tauthesis:$VERSION mythesis


Here ` $VERSION ` should be â¥ 0.9.0. The value ` $CACHEDIR ` for your OS can
be discovered from [ https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/fn.cache_dir.html
](https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/fn.cache_dir.html) .

For a manual installation, download the contents of this repository via Git or
as a ZIP file from the template [ tags ](https://gitlab.com/tuni-
official/thesis-templates/tau-typst-thesis-template/-/tags) page. Then, make a
symbolic link



    $DATADIR/typst/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/$VERSION/ â /path/to/root/of/tauthesis/


so that a local installation of ` typst ` can discover the ` tauthesis.typ `
file no matter where you are running it from. To find out the value ` $DATADIR
` for your operating system, see [
https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/fn.data_dir.html
](https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/fn.data_dir.html) . The value ` $VERSION `
is the version ` A.B.C ` â¥ ` 0.9.0 ` of this template you wish to use.

Once the package has been installed, the command



    typst init @preview/scholarly-tauthesis:$VERSION mythesis


creates a folder ` mythesis ` with the template files in place. Simply make
the ` mythesis ` folder you current working directory and run



    typst compile main.typ


in the shell of your choice to compile the document from scratch.
Alternatively, type



    typst watch main.typ &> typst.log &


to have a [ ` typst ` ](https://github.com/typst/typst) process watch the file
for changes and compile it when a file is changed. Possible error messages can
then be viewed by checking the contents of the mentioned file ` typst.log ` .

This template can also be uploaded to the typst online editor at [
https://typst.app/ ](https://typst.app/) . However, the file paths related to
the ` tauthesis ` file will need to be changed if this is done manually. See
the tutorial at [ https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/
](https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/) to learn the basics of the language. Some
examples are also given in the template itself.

==  Archiving the final version of your work

Before submitting your thesis to the university archives, it needs to be
converted to PDF/A format. Typst versions â¥ 0.12.0 should support the
creation of PDF/A-2b files, when run with the command



    typst compile --pdf-standard a-2b template/main.typ


If a verification program such as [ veraPDF
](https://docs.verapdf.org/install/) still complains that the file `
template/main.pdf ` does not conform to the standard, the Muuntaja-service of
Tampere University should be used to do the final conversion. See the related
instructions ( [ link ](https://libguides.tuni.fi/opinnaytteet/pdfa) ) for how
to do it. Basically it boils down to feeding your compiled PDF document to the
converter at [ https://muuntaja.tuni.fi ](https://muuntaja.tuni.fi/) .
*Remember to check that the output of the converter is not corrupted, before
submitting your thesis to the archives.*

==  Usage

You can either write your entire _main matter_ in the [ ` main.typ ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/0.9.0/template/main.typ) file, or more preferrably, split it into multiple chapter-specific files and place those in the [ ` contents/ ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/0.9.0/template/content) folder, which this template tries to demonstrate. If you choose to write your own commands (functions) in the [ ` preamble.typ ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/0.9.0/template/preamble.typ) file, this needs to be imported at the start of each chapter you plan to use the commands in. Sections that come before the main matter, like the Finnish and English abstracts ( [ ` tiivistelmÃ¤.typ ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/0.9.0/template/content/tiivistelm%C3%A4.typ) | [ ` abstract.typ ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/0.9.0/template/content/abstract.typ) ) and [ ` preface.typ ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/0.9.0/template/content/preface.typ) must _not_ be removed from the [ ` contents ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/0.9.0/template/content) folder, as the automation supposes that they are located there.

You should probably _not_ modify the file [ ` tauthesis.typ `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-
tauthesis/0.9.0/tauthesis.typ) , unless there is a bug that needs fixing right
now, and not when the maintainer of this project manages to find the time to
do it.

= *use-academicons.md*

=  use-academicons

0.1.0

A Typst library for Academicons the desktop fonts.

A Typst library for Academicons through the desktop fonts.

This is based on the code from ` duskmoon314 ` and the package for [ *typst-
fontawesome* ](https://github.com/duskmoon314/typst-fontawesome) .

p.s. The library is based on the Academicons desktop fonts (v1.9.4)

==  Usage

===  Install the fonts

You can download the fonts from the [ official website
](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/)

After downloading the zip file, you can install the fonts depending on your
OS.

====  Typst web app

You can simply upload the ` ttf ` files to the web app and use them with this
package.

====  Mac

You can double click the ` ttf ` files to install them.

====  Windows

You can right-click the ` ttf ` files and select ` Install ` .

===  Import the library

====  Using the typst packages

You can install the library using the typst packages:

` #import "@preview/use-academicons:0.1.0": * `

====  Manually install

Copy all files start with ` lib ` to your project and import the library:

` #import "lib.typ": * `

There are three files:

  - ` lib.typ ` : The main entrypoint of the library.
  - ` lib-impl.typ ` : The implementation of ` ai-icon ` .
  - ` lib-gen.typ ` : The generated icon map and functions.

I recommend renaming these files to avoid conflicts with other libraries.

===  Use the icons

You can use the ` ai-icon ` function to create an icon with its name:

` #ai-icon("lattes") `

Or you can use the ` ai- ` prefix to create an icon with its name:

` #ai-lattes() ` (This is equivalent to ` #ai-icon().with("lattes") ` )

====  Full list of icons

You can find all icons on the [ official website
](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/)

====  Customization

The ` ai-icon ` function passes args to ` text ` , so you can customize the
icon by passing parameters to it:

` #ai-icon("lattes", fill: blue) `

====  Stacking icons

The ` ai-stack ` function can be used to create stacked icons:

` #ai-stack(ai-icon-args: (fill: black), "doi", ("cv", (fill: blue, size:
20pt))) `

Declaration is ` ai-stack(box-args: (:), grid-args: (:), ai-icon-args: (:),
..icons) `

  - The order of the icons is from the bottom to the top.
  - ` ai-icon-args ` is used to set the default args for all icons.
  - You can also control the internal ` box ` and ` grid ` by passing the ` box-args ` and ` grid-args ` to the ` ai-stack ` function.
  - Currently, four types of icons are supported. The first three types leverage the ` ai-icon ` function, and the last type is just a content you want to put in the stack.
    - ` str ` , e.g., ` "lattes" `
    - ` array ` , e.g., ` ("lattes", (fill: white, size: 5.5pt)) `
    - ` arguments ` , e.g. ` arguments("lattes", fill: white) `
    - ` content ` , e.g. ` ai-lattes(fill: white) `

==  Example

See the [ ` use-academicons.typ `
](https://typst.app/project/rsgOFC4YkwpN7OqtRyiXP3) file for a complete
example.

==  Contribution

Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you find any problems or have
any suggestions.

===  R helper

The ` helper.R ` script is used to get unicodes for icons and generate typst
code.

===  Repo structure

  - ` helper.R ` : The helper script to get unicodes and generate typst code.
  - ` lib.typ ` : The main entrypoint of the library.
  - ` lib-impl.typ ` : The implementation of ` ai-icon ` .
  - ` lib-gen.typ ` : The generated functions of icons.
  - ` example.typ ` : An example file to show how to use the library.
  - ` gallery.typ ` : The generated gallery of icons. It is used in the example file.

==  License

This library is licensed under the MIT license. Feel free to use it in your
project.

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` use-academicons `



    #import "@preview/use-academicons:0.1.0"

= *blindex.md*

=  blindex

0.1.0

Index-making of Biblical literature citations in Typst

Blindex ( ` blindex:0.1.0 ` ) is a Typst package specifically designed for the
generation of indices of Biblical literature citations in documents. Target
audience includes theologians and authors of documents that frequently cite
biblical literature.

==  Index Sorting Options

The generated indices are gathered and sorted by Biblical literature books,
which can be ordered according to various Biblical literature book ordering
conventions, including:

  - ` "LXX" ` â The Septuagint;
  - ` "Greek-Bible" ` â Septuagint + New Testament (King James);
  - ` "Hebrew-Tanakh" ` â The Hebrew (Torah + Neviim + Ketuvim);
  - ` "Hebrew-Bible" ` â The Hebrew Tanakh + New Testament (King James);
  - ` "Protestant-Bible" ` â The Protestant Old + New Testaments;
  - ` "Catholic-Bible" ` â The Catholic Old + New Testaments;
  - ` "Orthodox-Bible" ` â The Orthodox Old + New Testaments;
  - ` "Oecumenic-Bible" ` â The Jewish Tanakh + Old Testament Deuterocanonical + New Testament;
  - ` "code" ` â All registered Biblical literature books: All Protestant + All Apocripha.

==  Biblical Literature Abbrevations

It is common practice among theologians to refer to biblical literature books
by their abbreviations. Practice shows that abbreviation conventions are
language- and tradition- dependent. Therefore, ` blindex ` usage reflects this
fact, while offering a way to input arbitrary language-tradition
abbreviations, in the ` lang.typ ` source file.

===  Language and Traditions (Variants)

The ` blindex ` implementation generalizes the concept of *tradition* (in
the context of biblical literature book abbreviation bookkeeping) as language
*variants* , since the software can have things such as a âdefaultâ of
ân-charâ variants.

As of the current release, supported languages include the following few ones:

Language  |  Variant  |  Description  |  Name
---|---|---|---
English  |  3-char  |  A 3-char abbreviations  |  ` en-3 `
English  |  Logos  |  Used in ` logos.com ` |  ` en-logos `
Portuguese (BR)  |  Protestant  |  Protestant for Brazil  |  ` br-pro `
Portuguese (BR)  |  Catholic  |  Catholic for Brazil  |  ` br-cat `

Additional language-variations can be added to the ` lang.typ ` source file by
the author and/or by pull requests to the ` dev ` branch of the (UNFORKED!)
development repository ` https://github.com/cnaak/blindex.typ ` .

==  Low-Level Indexing Command

The ` blindex ` library has a low-level, index entry marking function `
#blindex(abrv, lang, entry) ` , whose arguments are (abbreviation, language,
entry), as in:



    "the citation..." #blindex("1Thess", "en", [1.1--3]) citation's typesetting...


Following the usual index making strategy in Typst, this user ` #blindex `
command only adds the index-marking ` #metadata ` in the document, without
producing any visible typeset output.

Biblical literature index listings can be generated (typeset) in arbitrary
amounts and locations throughout the document, just by calling the user `
#mkIndex ` command:



    #mkIndex()


Optional arguments control style and sorting convention parameters, as
exemplified below.

==  Higher-Level Quoting-Indexing Commands

The library also offers higher-level functions to assemble the entire (i)
citation typesetting, (ii) index entry, (iii) citation typesetting, and (iv)
bibliography entrying (with some typesetting (styling) options), of the
passage. Such commands are ` #iQuot(...) ` and ` #bQuot(...) ` , respectively
for *inline* and *block* quoting of Biblical literature, with automatic
indexing and bibliography citation. Mandatory arguments are identical for
either command:



    paragraph text...
    #iQuot(body, abrv, lang, pssg, version, cited)
    more text...

    // Displayed block quote of Biblical literature:
    #bQuot(body, abrv, lang, pssg, version, cited)


In which:

  - ` body ` ( ` content ` ) is the quoted biblical literature text;
  - ` abrv ` ( ` string ` ) is the book abbreviation according to the
  - ` lang ` ( ` string ` ) language-variant (see above);
  - ` pssg ` ( ` content ` ) is the quoted text passage â usually chapter and verses â as they will appear in the text and in the biblical literature index;
  - ` version ` ( ` string ` ) is a translation identifier, such as ` "LXX" ` , or ` "KJV" ` ; and
  - ` cited ` ( ` label ` ) is the corresponding bibliography entry label, which can be constructed through:

` label("bib-key") ` , where ` bib-key ` is the bibliographic entry key, in
the bibliography database â whether ` bibTeX ` or ` Hayagriva ` .

==  Higher-Level Example



    #set page(paper: "a7", fill: rgb("#eec"))
    #import "@preview/blindex:0.1.0": *

    The Septuagint (LXX) starts with #iQuot([ÎÎ á¼ÏÏá¿ á¼ÏÎ¿á½·Î·ÏÎµÎ½ á½ ÎÎµá½¸Ï Ïá½¸Î½ Î¿á½ÏÎ±Î½á½¸Î½ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Ïá½´Î½ Î³á¿Î½.],
    "Gen", "en", [1.1], "LXX", label("2012-LXX-SBB")).

    #pagebreak()

    Moreover, the book of Odes begins with: #iQuot([á¾ Î´á½´ ÎÏÏÏÎ­ÏÏ á¼Î½ Ïá¿ á¼Î¾ÏÎ´á¿³], "Ode", "en", [1.0],
    "LXX", label("2012-LXX-SBB")).

    #pagebreak()

    = Biblical Citations
    Books are sorted following the LXX ordering.

    #mkIndex(cols: 1, sorting-tradition: "LXX")

    #pagebreak()

    #bibliography("test-01-readme.yml", title: "References", style: "ieee")


The listing of the bibliography file, ` test-01-readme.yml ` , as shown in the
example, is:



    2012-LXX-SBB:
      type: book
      title:
        value: "Septuaginta: EdiÃ§Ã£o AcadÃªmica Capa dura â EdiÃ§Ã£o de luxo"
        sentence-case: "Septuaginta: ediÃ§Ã£o acadÃªmica capa dura â ediÃ§Ã£o de luxo"
        short: Septuaginta
      publisher: Sociedade BÃ­blica do Brasil, SBB
      editor: Rahlfs, Alfred
      affiliated:
        - role: collaborator

      date: 2012-01-11
      edition: 1
      ISBN: 978-3438052278

0.4.0

Tabler Icons for Typst using webfont.

> *Note*
>
> This project is greatly inspired by and mainly edited based on [ typst-
> fontawesome ](https://github.com/duskmoon314/typst-fontawesome) .

==  ![use-tabler-
icons](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/use-tabler-
icons/0.4.0/assets/splash.svg)

A Typst library for [ Tabler Icons ](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons) ,
a set of over 5700 free MIT-licensed high-quality SVG icons.

==  Usage

===  Install Font

Download [ latest release of tabler-icons ](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-
icons/releases) and install ` webfont/fonts/tabler-icons.ttf ` . Or, if you
are using Typst web app, simply upload the font file to your project.

===  Import the Library

====  Using the Typst Packages

You can install the library using the typst packages:



    #import "@preview/use-tabler-icons:0.4.0": *


====  Manually Install

Just copy all files under [ ` src ` ](https://github.com/zyf722/typst-tabler-
icons/tree/main/src) to your project and rename them to avoid naming
conflicts.

Then, import ` lib.typ ` to use the library:



    #import "lib.typ": *


===  Use the Icons

You can use the ` tabler-icon ` function to create an icon with its name:



    #tabler-icon("calendar")


Or you can directly use the ` ti- ` prefix :



    #ti-calendar()


As these icons are actually text with custom font, you can pass any text
attributes to the function:



    #tabler-icon("calendar", fill: blue)


Refer to [ ` gallery.pdf ` ](https://github.com/zyf722/typst-tabler-
icons/tree/main/gallery/gallery.pdf) and [ Tabler Icons website

= *nulite.md*

=  nulite

0.1.0

Generate charts with vegalite.

A typst plugin to generate charts using [ vegalite
](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)

==  Usage



    #import "@preview/nulite:0.1.0" as vegalite

    #vegalite.render(
      width: 100%,
      height: 100%,
      zoom: 1,
      json("spec.json")
      )



![Example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/nulite/0.1.0/examples/image.png)

The module exports a single function, ` render ` with four arguments

  - ` width ` : Width of the chart in percent of the containerâs width
  - ` height ` : Height of the chart in percent of the containerâs height
  - ` zoom ` : Zoom factor applied to the SVG. This mainly affects the sizing of text in relation to the graphical elements.
  - ` spec ` : [ Vegalite specification ](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/spec.html)

==  Compatibility

This plugin uses vegalite v5.21 and vega v5.30.

The following features of vegalite are *not supported* :

  - Setting ` width ` and ` height ` in the spec. These values should be provided as arguments to ` render ` . If ` width ` or ` height ` are included in the spec then they will be ignored.
  - Loading data with the ` url ` property. Attempting to do this will result in an error while trying to compile the ` typst ` document. All data should be provided as part of the spec itself (inline).
  - Interactive charts and tooltips.

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` nulite `

template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/definitely-not-tuw-
thesis-0.1.0-small.webp)

=  definitely-not-tuw-thesis

0.1.0

An unofficial template for a thesis at the TU Wien informatics institute.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=definitely-not-tuw-
thesis&version=0.1.0)

An example thesis can be viewed here: [ https://otto-aa.github.io/definitely-
not-tuw-thesis/thesis.pdf ](https://otto-aa.github.io/definitely-not-tuw-
thesis/thesis.pdf)

==  Usage

You can download the template with:



    typst init @preview/definitely-not-tuw-thesis


===  Template overview

After setting up the template, you will have the following files:

  - ` thesis.typ ` : overall structure and styling, configuration for the cover pages and PDF metadata
  - ` content/front-matter.typ ` : acknowledgments and abstract
  - ` content/main.typ ` : all your chapters
  - ` content/appendix.typ ` : AI tools acknowledgment and other appendices
  - ` refs.bib ` : references

Then copy the values you get from compiling the [ official template
](https://gitlab.com/ThomasAUZINGER/vutinfth) , and paste them in ` thesis.typ
` . Remove all unused fields and, finally, compare if it is close enough to
the official template. If not, please open an issue or PR to fix it.

===  Styling

If you want to adapt the styling, you can remove the ` show: ... ` commands in
the ` thesis.typ ` and replace them with your own, or simply extend them with
your own ` show: ... ` commands.

==  Contributing

I guess there are many ways to improve this template, feel free to do so and
submit issues and PRs! More information at [ CONTRIBUTING.md

dragon-curve ` function.

![The rendered dragon
curve](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/fractusist/0.1.0/examples/dragon-
curve-n12.png)

Show code



    #set page(width: auto, height: auto, margin: 0pt)

    #dragon-curve(
      12,
      step-size: 6,
      stroke-style: stroke(
        paint: gradient.linear(..color.map.crest, angle: 45deg),
        thickness: 3pt,
        cap: "square"
      )
    )


==  Features

  - Use SVG backend for image rendering.
  - Generate fractals using [ L-system ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) .
  - The number of iterations, step size, fill and stroke styles, etc. of generated fractals could be customized.

==  Usage

Import the latest version of this package with:



    #import "@preview/fractusist:0.1.0": *


Each function generates a specific fractal. The input and output arguments of
all functions have a similar style. Typical input arguments are as follows:

  - ` n ` : the number of iterations ( *the valid range of values depends on the specific function* ).
  - _` step-size ` _ : step size (in pt).
  - _` fill-style ` _ : fill style, can be ` none ` or color or gradient ( *exists only when the curve is closed* ).
  - _` stroke-style ` _ : stroke style, can be ` none ` or color or gradient or stroke object.
  - _` width ` _ : the width of the image.
  - _` height ` _ : the height of the image.
  - _` fit ` _ : how the image should adjust itself to a given area, âcoverâ / âcontainâ / âstretchâ.

The content returned is the ` image ` element.

For more codes with these functions see [ tests
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/fractusist/0.1.0/tests)
.

= *scholarly-tauthesis.md*

![A preview of the scholarly-tauthesis Typst
template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/scholarly-
tauthesis-0.9.0-small.webp)

=  scholarly-tauthesis

0.9.0

A template for writing Tampere University theses.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=scholarly-tauthesis&version=0.9.0)

This is a TAU thesis template written in the [ ` typst `
](https://github.com/typst/typst) typesetting language, a potential successor
to LaTeÎ§. The version of typst used to test this template is [ ` 0.12.0 `
](https://github.com/typst/typst/releases/tag/v0.12.0) .

==  Using the template on typst.app

This template is also available on [ Typst Universe
](https://typst.app/universe) as [ ` scholarly-tauthesis `
](https://typst.app/universe/package/scholarly-tauthesis) . Simply create an
account on [ https://typst.app/ ](https://typst.app/) and start a new `
scholarly-tauthesis ` project by clicking on *Start from template* and
searching for *scholarly-tauthesis* .

If you have initialized your project with an older stable version of this
template and wish to upgrade to a newer release, the simplest way to do it is
to change the value of ` $VERSION ` â¥ ` 0.9.0 ` in the import statements



    #import "@preview/scholarly-tauthesis:$VERSION" as tauthesis


to correspond to a newer released version. Alternatively, you could download
the ` tauthesis.typ ` file from the [ thesis template repository
](https://gitlab.com/tuni-official/thesis-templates/tau-typst-thesis-template)
, and upload it into you project on [ https://typst.app/ ](https://typst.app/)
. Then use



    #import "path/to/tauthesis.typ" as tauthesis


instead of



    #import "@preview/scholarly-tauthesis:$VERSION" as tauthesis


to import the ` tauthesis ` module.

===  Note

Versions of this template before 0.9.0 do not actually work with typst.app due
to a packaging issue.

==  Local installation

If [ Typst Universe ](https://typst.app/universe) is online, this template
will be downloaded automatically to



    $CACHEDIR/typst/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/$VERSION/


when one runs the command



    typst init @preview/scholarly-tauthesis:$VERSION mythesis


Here ` $VERSION ` should be â¥ 0.9.0. The value ` $CACHEDIR ` for your OS can
be discovered from [ https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/fn.cache_dir.html
](https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/fn.cache_dir.html) .

For a manual installation, download the contents of this repository via Git or
as a ZIP file from the template [ tags ](https://gitlab.com/tuni-
official/thesis-templates/tau-typst-thesis-template/-/tags) page. Then, make a
symbolic link



    $DATADIR/typst/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/$VERSION/ â /path/to/root/of/tauthesis/


so that a local installation of ` typst ` can discover the ` tauthesis.typ `
file no matter where you are running it from. To find out the value ` $DATADIR
` for your operating system, see [
https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/fn.data_dir.html
](https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/fn.data_dir.html) . The value ` $VERSION `
is the version ` A.B.C ` â¥ ` 0.9.0 ` of this template you wish to use.

Once the package has been installed, the command



    typst init @preview/scholarly-tauthesis:$VERSION mythesis


creates a folder ` mythesis ` with the template files in place. Simply make
the ` mythesis ` folder you current working directory and run



    typst compile main.typ


in the shell of your choice to compile the document from scratch.
Alternatively, type



    typst watch main.typ &> typst.log &


to have a [ ` typst ` ](https://github.com/typst/typst) process watch the file
for changes and compile it when a file is changed. Possible error messages can
then be viewed by checking the contents of the mentioned file ` typst.log ` .

This template can also be uploaded to the typst online editor at [
https://typst.app/ ](https://typst.app/) . However, the file paths related to
the ` tauthesis ` file will need to be changed if this is done manually. See
the tutorial at [ https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/
](https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/) to learn the basics of the language. Some
examples are also given in the template itself.

==  Archiving the final version of your work

Before submitting your thesis to the university archives, it needs to be
converted to PDF/A format. Typst versions â¥ 0.12.0 should support the
creation of PDF/A-2b files, when run with the command



    typst compile --pdf-standard a-2b template/main.typ


If a verification program such as [ veraPDF
](https://docs.verapdf.org/install/) still complains that the file `
template/main.pdf ` does not conform to the standard, the Muuntaja-service of
Tampere University should be used to do the final conversion. See the related
instructions ( [ link ](https://libguides.tuni.fi/opinnaytteet/pdfa) ) for how
to do it. Basically it boils down to feeding your compiled PDF document to the
converter at [ https://muuntaja.tuni.fi ](https://muuntaja.tuni.fi/) .
*Remember to check that the output of the converter is not corrupted, before
submitting your thesis to the archives.*

==  Usage

You can either write your entire _main matter_ in the [ ` main.typ ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/0.9.0/template/main.typ) file, or more preferrably, split it into multiple chapter-specific files and place those in the [ ` contents/ ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/0.9.0/template/content) folder, which this template tries to demonstrate. If you choose to write your own commands (functions) in the [ ` preamble.typ ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/0.9.0/template/preamble.typ) file, this needs to be imported at the start of each chapter you plan to use the commands in. Sections that come before the main matter, like the Finnish and English abstracts ( [ ` tiivistelmÃ¤.typ ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/0.9.0/template/content/tiivistelm%C3%A4.typ) | [ ` abstract.typ ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/0.9.0/template/content/abstract.typ) ) and [ ` preface.typ ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/0.9.0/template/content/preface.typ) must _not_ be removed from the [ ` contents ` ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-tauthesis/0.9.0/template/content) folder, as the automation supposes that they are located there.

You should probably _not_ modify the file [ ` tauthesis.typ `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/scholarly-
tauthesis/0.9.0/tauthesis.typ) , unless there is a bug that needs fixing right
now, and not when the maintainer of this project manages to find the time to
do it.

==  Contributing

Issues may be created in the issue tracker on the [ template GitLab repository
](https://gitlab.com/tuni-official/thesis-templates/tau-typst-thesis-template)
, if one has a GitLab account. Merge requests may also be performed after
GitLab account creation, and forking the project. See GitLabâs documentation
on this to find out how to do it [ link

= *use-academicons.md*

=  use-academicons

0.1.0

A Typst library for Academicons the desktop fonts.

A Typst library for Academicons through the desktop fonts.

This is based on the code from ` duskmoon314 ` and the package for [ *typst-
fontawesome* ](https://github.com/duskmoon314/typst-fontawesome) .

p.s. The library is based on the Academicons desktop fonts (v1.9.4)

==  Usage

===  Install the fonts

You can download the fonts from the [ official website
](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/)

After downloading the zip file, you can install the fonts depending on your
OS.

====  Typst web app

You can simply upload the ` ttf ` files to the web app and use them with this
package.

====  Mac

You can double click the ` ttf ` files to install them.

====  Windows

You can right-click the ` ttf ` files and select ` Install ` .

===  Import the library

====  Using the typst packages

You can install the library using the typst packages:

` #import "@preview/use-academicons:0.1.0": * `

====  Manually install

Copy all files start with ` lib ` to your project and import the library:

` #import "lib.typ": * `

There are three files:

  - ` lib.typ ` : The main entrypoint of the library.
  - ` lib-impl.typ ` : The implementation of ` ai-icon ` .
  - ` lib-gen.typ ` : The generated icon map and functions.

I recommend renaming these files to avoid conflicts with other libraries.

===  Use the icons

You can use the ` ai-icon ` function to create an icon with its name:

` #ai-icon("lattes") `

Or you can use the ` ai- ` prefix to create an icon with its name:

` #ai-lattes() ` (This is equivalent to ` #ai-icon().with("lattes") ` )

====  Full list of icons

You can find all icons on the [ official website
](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/)

====  Customization

The ` ai-icon ` function passes args to ` text ` , so you can customize the
icon by passing parameters to it:

` #ai-icon("lattes", fill: blue) `

====  Stacking icons

The ` ai-stack ` function can be used to create stacked icons:

` #ai-stack(ai-icon-args: (fill: black), "doi", ("cv", (fill: blue, size:
20pt))) `

Declaration is ` ai-stack(box-args: (:), grid-args: (:), ai-icon-args: (:),
..icons) `

  - The order of the icons is from the bottom to the top.
  - ` ai-icon-args ` is used to set the default args for all icons.
  - You can also control the internal ` box ` and ` grid ` by passing the ` box-args ` and ` grid-args ` to the ` ai-stack ` function.
  - Currently, four types of icons are supported. The first three types leverage the ` ai-icon ` function, and the last type is just a content you want to put in the stack.
    - ` str ` , e.g., ` "lattes" `
    - ` array ` , e.g., ` ("lattes", (fill: white, size: 5.5pt)) `
    - ` arguments ` , e.g. ` arguments("lattes", fill: white) `
    - ` content ` , e.g. ` ai-lattes(fill: white) `

==  Example

See the [ ` use-academicons.typ `
](https://typst.app/project/rsgOFC4YkwpN7OqtRyiXP3) file for a complete
example.

==  Contribution

Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you find any problems or have
any suggestions.

===  R helper

The ` helper.R ` script is used to get unicodes for icons and generate typst
code.

===  Repo structure

  - ` helper.R ` : The helper script to get unicodes and generate typst code.
  - ` lib.typ ` : The main entrypoint of the library.
  - ` lib-impl.typ ` : The implementation of ` ai-icon ` .
  - ` lib-gen.typ ` : The generated functions of icons.
  - ` example.typ ` : An example file to show how to use the library.
  - ` gallery.typ ` : The generated gallery of icons. It is used in the example file.

==  License

This library is licensed under the MIT license. Feel free to use it in your
project.

= *blindex.md*

=  blindex

0.1.0

Index-making of Biblical literature citations in Typst

Blindex ( ` blindex:0.1.0 ` ) is a Typst package specifically designed for the
generation of indices of Biblical literature citations in documents. Target
audience includes theologians and authors of documents that frequently cite
biblical literature.

==  Index Sorting Options

The generated indices are gathered and sorted by Biblical literature books,
which can be ordered according to various Biblical literature book ordering
conventions, including:

  - ` "LXX" ` â The Septuagint;
  - ` "Greek-Bible" ` â Septuagint + New Testament (King James);
  - ` "Hebrew-Tanakh" ` â The Hebrew (Torah + Neviim + Ketuvim);
  - ` "Hebrew-Bible" ` â The Hebrew Tanakh + New Testament (King James);
  - ` "Protestant-Bible" ` â The Protestant Old + New Testaments;
  - ` "Catholic-Bible" ` â The Catholic Old + New Testaments;
  - ` "Orthodox-Bible" ` â The Orthodox Old + New Testaments;
  - ` "Oecumenic-Bible" ` â The Jewish Tanakh + Old Testament Deuterocanonical + New Testament;
  - ` "code" ` â All registered Biblical literature books: All Protestant + All Apocripha.

==  Biblical Literature Abbrevations

It is common practice among theologians to refer to biblical literature books
by their abbreviations. Practice shows that abbreviation conventions are
language- and tradition- dependent. Therefore, ` blindex ` usage reflects this
fact, while offering a way to input arbitrary language-tradition
abbreviations, in the ` lang.typ ` source file.

===  Language and Traditions (Variants)

The ` blindex ` implementation generalizes the concept of *tradition* (in
the context of biblical literature book abbreviation bookkeeping) as language
*variants* , since the software can have things such as a âdefaultâ of
ân-charâ variants.

As of the current release, supported languages include the following few ones:

Language  |  Variant  |  Description  |  Name
---|---|---|---
English  |  3-char  |  A 3-char abbreviations  |  ` en-3 `
English  |  Logos  |  Used in ` logos.com ` |  ` en-logos `
Portuguese (BR)  |  Protestant  |  Protestant for Brazil  |  ` br-pro `
Portuguese (BR)  |  Catholic  |  Catholic for Brazil  |  ` br-cat `

Additional language-variations can be added to the ` lang.typ ` source file by
the author and/or by pull requests to the ` dev ` branch of the (UNFORKED!)
development repository ` https://github.com/cnaak/blindex.typ ` .

==  Low-Level Indexing Command

The ` blindex ` library has a low-level, index entry marking function `
#blindex(abrv, lang, entry) ` , whose arguments are (abbreviation, language,
entry), as in:



    "the citation..." #blindex("1Thess", "en", [1.1--3]) citation's typesetting...


Following the usual index making strategy in Typst, this user ` #blindex `
command only adds the index-marking ` #metadata ` in the document, without
producing any visible typeset output.

Biblical literature index listings can be generated (typeset) in arbitrary
amounts and locations throughout the document, just by calling the user `
#mkIndex ` command:



    #mkIndex()


Optional arguments control style and sorting convention parameters, as
exemplified below.

==  Higher-Level Quoting-Indexing Commands

The library also offers higher-level functions to assemble the entire (i)
citation typesetting, (ii) index entry, (iii) citation typesetting, and (iv)
bibliography entrying (with some typesetting (styling) options), of the
passage. Such commands are ` #iQuot(...) ` and ` #bQuot(...) ` , respectively
for *inline* and *block* quoting of Biblical literature, with automatic
indexing and bibliography citation. Mandatory arguments are identical for
either command:



    paragraph text...
    #iQuot(body, abrv, lang, pssg, version, cited)
    more text...

    // Displayed block quote of Biblical literature:
    #bQuot(body, abrv, lang, pssg, version, cited)


In which:

  - ` body ` ( ` content ` ) is the quoted biblical literature text;
  - ` abrv ` ( ` string ` ) is the book abbreviation according to the
  - ` lang ` ( ` string ` ) language-variant (see above);
  - ` pssg ` ( ` content ` ) is the quoted text passage â usually chapter and verses â as they will appear in the text and in the biblical literature index;
  - ` version ` ( ` string ` ) is a translation identifier, such as ` "LXX" ` , or ` "KJV" ` ; and
  - ` cited ` ( ` label ` ) is the corresponding bibliography entry label, which can be constructed through:

` label("bib-key") ` , where ` bib-key ` is the bibliographic entry key, in
the bibliography database â whether ` bibTeX ` or ` Hayagriva ` .

==  Higher-Level Example



    #set page(paper: "a7", fill: rgb("#eec"))
    #import "@preview/blindex:0.1.0": *

    The Septuagint (LXX) starts with #iQuot([ÎÎ á¼ÏÏá¿ á¼ÏÎ¿á½·Î·ÏÎµÎ½ á½ ÎÎµá½¸Ï Ïá½¸Î½ Î¿á½ÏÎ±Î½á½¸Î½ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Ïá½´Î½ Î³á¿Î½.],
    "Gen", "en", [1.1], "LXX", label("2012-LXX-SBB")).

    #pagebreak()

    Moreover, the book of Odes begins with: #iQuot([á¾ Î´á½´ ÎÏÏÏÎ­ÏÏ á¼Î½ Ïá¿ á¼Î¾ÏÎ´á¿³], "Ode", "en", [1.0],
    "LXX", label("2012-LXX-SBB")).

    #pagebreak()

    = Biblical Citations
    Books are sorted following the LXX ordering.

    #mkIndex(cols: 1, sorting-tradition: "LXX")

    #pagebreak()

    #bibliography("test-01-readme.yml", title: "References", style: "ieee")


The listing of the bibliography file, ` test-01-readme.yml ` , as shown in the
example, is:



    2012-LXX-SBB:
      type: book
      title:
        value: "Septuaginta: EdiÃ§Ã£o AcadÃªmica Capa dura â EdiÃ§Ã£o de luxo"
        sentence-case: "Septuaginta: ediÃ§Ã£o acadÃªmica capa dura â ediÃ§Ã£o de luxo"
        short: Septuaginta

==  ![use-tabler-
icons](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/use-tabler-
icons/0.4.0/assets/splash.svg)

A Typst library for [ Tabler Icons ](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons) ,
a set of over 5700 free MIT-licensed high-quality SVG icons.

==  Usage

===  Install Font

Download [ latest release of tabler-icons ](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-
icons/releases) and install ` webfont/fonts/tabler-icons.ttf ` . Or, if you
are using Typst web app, simply upload the font file to your project.

===  Import the Library

====  Using the Typst Packages

You can install the library using the typst packages:



    #import "@preview/use-tabler-icons:0.4.0": *


====  Manually Install

Just copy all files under [ ` src ` ](https://github.com/zyf722/typst-tabler-
icons/tree/main/src) to your project and rename them to avoid naming
conflicts.

Then, import ` lib.typ ` to use the library:



    #import "lib.typ": *


===  Use the Icons

You can use the ` tabler-icon ` function to create an icon with its name:



    #tabler-icon("calendar")


Or you can directly use the ` ti- ` prefix :



    #ti-calendar()


As these icons are actually text with custom font, you can pass any text
attributes to the function:



    #tabler-icon("calendar", fill: blue)


Refer to [ ` gallery.pdf ` ](https://github.com/zyf722/typst-tabler-
icons/tree/main/gallery/gallery.pdf) and [ Tabler Icons website
](https://tabler.io/icons) for all available icons.

= *nulite.md*

=  nulite

0.1.0

Generate charts with vegalite.

A typst plugin to generate charts using [ vegalite
](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)

==  Usage



    #import "@preview/nulite:0.1.0" as vegalite

    #vegalite.render(
      width: 100%,
      height: 100%,
      zoom: 1,
      json("spec.json")
      )



![Example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/nulite/0.1.0/examples/image.png)

The module exports a single function, ` render ` with four arguments

  - ` width ` : Width of the chart in percent of the containerâs width
  - ` height ` : Height of the chart in percent of the containerâs height
  - ` zoom ` : Zoom factor applied to the SVG. This mainly affects the sizing of text in relation to the graphical elements.
  - ` spec ` : [ Vegalite specification ](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/spec.html)

==  Compatibility

This plugin uses vegalite v5.21 and vega v5.30.

The following features of vegalite are *not supported* :

  - Setting ` width ` and ` height ` in the spec. These values should be provided as arguments to ` render ` . If ` width ` or ` height ` are included in the spec then they will be ignored.
  - Loading data with the ` url ` property. Attempting to do this will result in an error while trying to compile the ` typst ` document. All data should be provided as part of the spec itself (inline).
  - Interactive charts and tooltips.

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` nulite `

= *indenta.md*

=  indenta

0.0.3

Fix indent of first paragraph.

An attempt to fix the indentation of the first paragraph in typst.

It works.

==  Usage



    #set par(first-line-indent: 2em)
    #import "@preview/indenta:0.0.3": fix-indent
    #show: fix-indent()



==  Demo

![image](https://github.com/flaribbit/indenta/assets/24885181/874df696-3277-4103-9166-a24639b0c7c6)

==  Note

When you use ` fix-indent() ` with other show rules, make sure to call ` fix-
indent() ` *after other show rules* . For example:



    #show heading.where(level: 1): set text(size: 20pt)
    #show: fix-indent()


If you want to process the content inside your custom block, you can call `
fix-indent ` inside your block. For example:



    #block[#set text(fill: red)
    #show: fix-indent()

    Hello

    #table()[table]

    World
    ]


This package is in a very early stage and may not work as expected in some
cases. Currently, there is no easy way to check if an element is inlined or
not. If you got an unexpected result, you can try ` fix-indent(unsafe: true) `
to disable the check.

Minor fixes can be made at any time, but the package in typst universe may not
be updated immediately. You can check the latest version on [ GitHub
](https://github.com/flaribbit/indenta) then copy and paste the code into your
typst file.

If it still doesnât work as expected, you can try another solution (aka
fake-par solution):



    #let fakepar=context{box();v(-measure(block()+block()).height)}
    #show heading: it=>it+fakepar
    #show figure: it=>it+fakepar
    #show math.equation.where(block: true): it=>it+fakepar
    // ... other elements


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` indenta `



    #import "@preview/indenta:0.0.3"

    = Pirates

    Pirates, a term often associated with seafaring outlaws, have left an indelible mark on world history. The term conjures images of Jolly Roger flags, eye patches, and treasure chests, but the reality of piracy is more complex and varied than its romanticized image suggests. Historically, pirates were motivated by wealth, adventure, or desperation and were not confined to the seas of the Caribbean but roamed the waters of the Mediterranean, the South China Sea, and the Atlantic Ocean. Pirate societies were notorious for their flouting of societal norms, and many pirate ships operated under democratic principles, offering crew members an equal share in the spoils and voting rights on important decisions. To get a better picture, it's worth looking into how the social structures onboard these pirate vessels contrasted with those on merchant or navy vessels of the same era. #todo([Research and provide more _detail_ on #underline[pirate ship] governance and societal norms ])

    Pirates' influence on history extends beyond their shipboard societies, however. Many pirates played important roles in global trade, war, and politics, often acting as privateers for countries at war. At times, they acted as de facto naval forces, protecting their patron countries' interests or disrupting those of their enemies. During the Golden Age of Piracy, roughly from 1650 to 1720, pirates were a major force in the Atlantic and the Caribbean #todo("other seas?", inline: true), attacking the heavily laden ships of the Spanish Empire and others. They have also impacted popular culture, inspiring countless books, movies, and games. But their story is not finished. Modern-day piracy, especially off the coast of Somalia, has become a significant issue in international shipping.

    #todo_outline


![Screenshot of above Example](https://user-
images.githubusercontent.com/64754924/250580952-e427a139-1c6e-4eb6-9eee-c07d98875c88.png)

The ` todo ` function has the follwin parameters and defaults:

Parameter  |  Default  |  Type  |  Description
---|---|---|---
` body ` |  /  |  Content  |  Content of the todo
` inline ` |  false  |  Boolean  |  If true, the todo will be inline, otherwise it will be block
` big_text ` |  40pt  |  Length  |  Size of the ` ! TODO ! ` text
` small_text ` |  15pt  |  Length  |  Size of the content
` gap ` |  2mm  |  Length  |  Gap between the ` ! TODO ! ` text and the content

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` big-todo `

A port of the [ Awesome-CV ](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) Latex
resume template in [ typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) .

==  Requirements

===  Tools

The following tools are used for the development of this template:

  - [ typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst)
  - [ typst-test ](https://github.com/tingerrr/typst-test) for running tests
  - [ just ](https://github.com/casey/just) for simplifying command running
  - [ oxipng ](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng) for compressing thumbnails used in the README

===  Fonts

You will need the ` Roboto ` and ` Source Sans Pro ` fonts installed on your
system or available somewhere. If you are using the ` typst ` web app, no
further action is necessary. You can download them from the following links:

  - [ Roboto ](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
  - [ Source Sans Pro ](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro)

This template also uses FontAwesome icons via the [ fontawesome
](https://typst.app/universe/package/fontawesome) package. You will need to
install the fontawesome fonts on your system or configure the ` typst ` web
app to use them. You can download fontawesome [ here
](https://fontawesome.com/download) .

To use the fontawesome icons in the web app, add a ` fonts ` folder to your
project and upload the ` otf ` files from the fontawesome download to this
folder like so:

![alt
text](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/modern-
cv/0.7.0/assets/images/typst_web_editor.png)

See ` typst fonts --help ` for more information on configuring fonts for `
typst ` that are not installed on your system.

===  Usage

Below is a basic example for a simple resume:



    #import "@preview/modern-cv:0.7.0": *

    #show: resume.with(
      author: (
          firstname: "John",
          lastname: "Smith",
          email: "js@example.com",
          phone: "(+1) 111-111-1111",
          github: "DeveloperPaul123",
          linkedin: "Example",
          address: "111 Example St. Example City, EX 11111",
          positions: (
            "Software Engineer",
            "Software Architect"
          )
      ),
      date: datetime.today().display()
    )

    = Education

    #resume-entry(
      title: "Example University",
      location: "B.S. in Computer Science",
      date: "August 2014 - May 2019",
      description: "Example"
    )

    #resume-item[
      - #lorem(20)
      - #lorem(15)
      - #lorem(25)
    ]


After saving to a ` *.typ ` file, compile your resume using the following
command:



    typst compile resume.typ


For more information on how to use and compile ` typst ` files, see the [
official documentation ](https://typst.app/docs) .

Documentation for this template is published with each commit. See the
attached PDF on each Github Action run [ here
](https://github.com/DeveloperPaul123/modern-cv/actions) .

==  Building and Testing Locally

To build and test the project locally, you will need to install the ` typst `
CLI. You can find instructions on how to do this [ here
](https://github.com/typst/typst#installation) .

With typst installed you can make changes to ` lib.typ ` and then ` just
install ` or ` just install-preview ` to install the package locally. Change
the import statements in the template files to point to the local package (if
needed):



    #import "@local/modern-cv:0.6.0": *


If you use ` just install-preview ` you will only need to update the version
number to match ` typst.toml ` .

Note that the script parses the ` typst.toml ` to determine the version number
and the folder the local files are installed to.

===  Formatting

This project uses [ typstyle ](https://github.com/Enter-tainer/typstyle) to
format the code. Run ` just format ` to format all the ` *.typ ` files in the
project. Be sure to install ` typstyle ` before running the script.

==  License

The project is licensed under the MIT license. See [ LICENSE
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/modern-

= *unichar.md*

=  unichar

0.3.0

A partial port of the Unicode Character Database.

This package ports part of the [ Unicode Character Database
](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/) to Typst. Notably, it includes
information from [ UnicodeData.txt
](https://unicode.org/reports/tr44/#UnicodeData.txt) and [ Blocks.txt
](https://unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Blocks.txt) .

==  Usage

This package defines a single function: ` codepoint ` . It lets you get the
information related to a specific codepoint. The codepoint can be specified as
a string containing a single character, or with its value.



    #codepoint("â").name \
    #codepoint(sym.times).block.name \
    #codepoint(0x00C9).general-category \
    #codepoint(sym.eq).math-class


![image](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/unichar/0.3.0/examples/example-1.svg)

You can display a codepoint in the style of [ Template:Unichar
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Unichar) using the ` show ` entry:



    #codepoint("Â¤").show \
    #codepoint(sym.copyright).show \
    #codepoint(0x1249).show \
    #codepoint(0x100000).show


![image](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/unichar/0.3.0/examples/example-2.svg)

==  Changelog

===  Version 0.3.0

  - Add ` math-class ` attribute to codepoints.

    - Some codepoints have their math class overridden by Typst. This is the Unicode math class, not the one used by Typst.
  - The ` id ` of codepoints now returns a string without the ` "U+" ` prefix.

===  Version 0.2.0

  - Codepoints now have an ` id ` attribute which is its corresponding âU+xxxxâ string.

  - The ` block ` attribute of a codepoint now contains a ` name ` , a ` start ` , and a ` size ` .

  - Fix an issue that made some codepoints cause a panic.

  - Include data from NameAlias.txt.

===  Version 0.1.0

  - Add the ` codepoint ` function.

= *dining-table.md*

=  dining-table

0.1.0

Column-wise table definitions for big data

Version 0.1.0

Implements a layer on top of table to allow the user to define a table by
column rather than by row, to automatically handle headers and footers, to
implement table footnotes, to handle nested column quirks for you, to handle
rendering nested data structures.

Basically, if you are tabulating data where each row is an observation, and
some features (columns) are to be grouped (a common case for scientific data)
then this package might be worth checking out. Another use case is where you
have multiple tables with identical layouts, and you wish to keep them all
consistent with one another.

![Light](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/dining-
table/0.1.0/examples/ledger.png)

==  Usage

See the manual for in-depth usage, but for a quick reference, here is the
ledger example (which is fully featured)



    #import "@preview/dining-table:0.1.0"

    #let data = (
      (

      ),
    )*7

    #import "@preview/typpuccino:0.1.0"
    #let bg-fill-1 = typpuccino.latte.base
    #let bg-fill-2 = typpuccino.latte.mantle

    #let example = (
      (
        key: "date",
        header: align(left)[Date],
        display: (it)=>it.display(auto),

0.1.1

A simple package to format Backus-Naur form (BNF)

simplebnf is a simple package to format Backus-Naur form. The package provides
a simple way to format Backus-Naur form (BNF). It provides constructs to
denote BNF expressions, possibly with annotations.

This is a sister package of [ simplebnf
](https://github.com/Zeta611/simplebnf) , a LaTeX package under the same name
by the author.

==  Usage

Import simplebnf via



    #import "@preview/simplebnf:0.1.1": *


Use the ` bnf ` function to display the BNF production rules. Each production
rule can be created using the ` Prod ` constructor function, which accepts the
(left-hand side) metavariable, an optional annotation for it, an optional
delimiter (which defaults to â©´), and a list of (right-hand side)
alternatives. Each alternative should be created using the ` Or ` constructor,
which accepts a syntactic form and an annotation.

Below are some examples using simplebnf.



    #bnf(
      Prod(
        $e$,
        annot: $sans("Expr")$,
        {
          Or[$x$][_variable_]
          Or[$Î» x. e$][_abstraction_]
          Or[$e$ $e$][_application_]
        },
      ),
    )


![lambda](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/simplebnf/0.1.1/examples/lambda.svg)



    #bnf(
      Prod(
        $e$,
        delim: $â$,
        {
          Or[$x$][variable]
          Or[$Î» x: Ï.e$][abstraction]
          Or[$e space e$][application]
          Or[$Î» Ï.e space e$][type abstraction]
          Or[$e space [Ï]$][type application]
        },
      ),
      Prod(
        $Ï$,
        delim: $â$,
        {
          Or[$X$][type variable]

=  curryst

0.3.0

Typeset trees of inference rules.

Featured  Package

A Typst package for typesetting proof trees.

==  Import

You can import the latest version of this package with:



    #import "@preview/curryst:0.3.0": rule, proof-tree


==  Basic usage

To display a proof tree, you first need to create a tree, using the ` rule `
function. Its first argument is the conclusion, and the other positional
arguments are the premises. It also accepts a ` name ` for the rule name,
displayed on the right of the bar, as well as a ` label ` , displayed on the
left of the bar.



    #let tree = rule(
      label: [Label],
      name: [Rule name],
      [Conclusion],
      [Premise 1],
      [Premise 2],
      [Premise 3]
    )


Then, you can display the tree with the ` proof-tree ` function:



    #proof-tree(tree)


In this case, we get the following result:

![A proof tree with three premises, a conclusion, and a rule
name.](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/curryst/0.3.0/examples/usage.svg)

Proof trees can be part of mathematical formulas:



    Consider the following tree:
    $
      Pi quad = quad #proof-tree(
        rule(
          $phi$,
          $Pi_1$,
          $Pi_2$,
        )
      )
    $
    $Pi$ constitutes a derivation of $phi$.s


![The rendered
document.](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/curryst/0.3.0/examples/math-
formula.svg)

You can specify a rule as the premises of a rule in order to create a tree:



    #proof-tree(
      rule(
        name: $R$,
        $C_1 or C_2 or C_3$,
        rule(
          name: $A$,
          $C_1 or C_2 or L$,
          rule(
            $C_1 or L$,
            $Pi_1$,
          ),
        ),
        rule(
          $C_2 or overline(L)$,
          $Pi_2$,
        ),
      )
    )


![The rendered
tree.](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/curryst/0.3.0/examples/rule-
as-premise.svg)

As an example, here is a natural deduction proof tree generated with Curryst:

deduction.svg)

Show code



    #let ax = rule.with(name: [ax])
    #let and-el = rule.with(name: $and_e^ell$)
    #let and-er = rule.with(name: $and_e^r$)
    #let impl-i = rule.with(name: $scripts(->)_i$)
    #let impl-e = rule.with(name: $scripts(->)_e$)
    #let not-i = rule.with(name: $not_i$)
    #let not-e = rule.with(name: $not_e$)

    #proof-tree(
      impl-i(
        $tack (p -> q) -> not (p and not q)$,
        not-i(
          $p -> q tack  not (p and not q)$,
          not-e(
            $ underbrace(p -> q\, p and not q, Gamma) tack bot $,
            impl-e(
              $Gamma tack q$,
              ax($Gamma tack p -> q$),
              and-el(
                $Gamma tack p$,
                ax($Gamma tack p and not q$),
              ),
            ),
            and-er(
              $Gamma tack not q$,
              ax($Gamma tack p and not q$),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      )
    )


==  Advanced usage

The ` proof-tree ` function accepts multiple named arguments that let you
customize the tree:

` prem-min-spacing `

     The minimum amount of space between two premises.
` title-inset `

     The amount width with which to extend the horizontal bar beyond the content. Also determines how far from the bar labels and names are displayed.
` stroke `

     The stroke to use for the horizontal bars.
` horizontal-spacing `

     The space between the bottom of the bar and the conclusion, and between the top of the bar and the premises.
` min-bar-height `

     The minimum height of the box containing the horizontal bar.

For more information, please refer to the documentation in [ ` curryst.typ `
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/curryst/0.3.0/curryst.typ)

= *sigfig.md*

=  sigfig

0.1.0

Typst library for rounding numbers with significant figures and measurement
uncertainty.

` sigfig ` is a [ Typst ](https://typst.app/) package for rounding numbers
with [ significant figures
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures) and [ measurement
uncertainty ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_uncertainty) .

==  Overview



    #import "@preview/sigfig:0.1.0": round, urounds
    #import "@preview/unify:0.5.0": num

    $ #num(round(98654, 3)) $
    $ #num(round(2.8977729e-3, 4)) $
    $ #num(round(-.0999, 2)) $
    $ #num(urounds(114514.19, 1.98)) $
    $ #num(urounds(1234.5678, 0.096)) $


yields

==  Documentation

===  ` round `

` round ` is similar to JavaScriptâs ` Number.prototype.toPrecision() ` ( [
ES spec ](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/numbers-and-dates.html#sec-
number.prototype.toprecision) ).



    #assert(round(114514, 3) == "1.15e5")
    #assert(round(1, 5) == "1.0000")
    #assert(round(12345, 10) == "12345.00000")
    #assert(round(.00000002468, 3) == "2.47e-8")


Note that what is different from the ES spec is that there will be no sign
($+$) if the exponent after ` e ` is positive.

===  ` uround `

` uround ` rounds a number with its uncertainty, and returns a string of both.



    #assert(uround(114514, 1919) == "1.15e5+-2e3")
    #assert(uround(114514.0, 1.9) == "114514+-2")


===  ` urounds `

` uround ` rounds a number with its uncertainty, and returns a string of both
with the same exponent, if any.

You can use ` num ` in ` unify ` to display the result.

1.0.2

A colorful CV template

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=vercanard&version=1.0.2)

A colorful resume template for Typst.

The [ demo
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/vercanard/1.0.2/template/main.typ)
file showcases what it is possible to do. You can see the result in [ the
corresponding PDF
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/vercanard/1.0.2/demo.pdf)
.

First of all, copy the template to your Typst project, and import it.



    #import "@preview/vercanard:1.0.2": *


Then, call the ` resume ` in a global ` show ` rule function to use it. This
function takes a few arguments that we explain in comments below:



    #show: resume.with(
      // The title of your resume, generally your name
      name: "Your name",
      // The subtitle, which is the position you are looking for most of the time
      title: "What you are looking for",
      // The accent color to use (here a vibrant yellow)
      accent-color: rgb("f3bc54"),
      // the margins (only used for top and left page margins actually,
      // but the other ones are proportional)
      margin: 2.6cm,
      // The content to put in the right aside block
      aside: [
        = Contact

        // lists in the aside are right aligned
        - #link("mailto:example@example.org")
        - +33 6 66 66 66 66
      ]
    )

    // And finally the main body of your resume can come here


When writing the body, you can use level-1 headings as section titles, and
format an entry with the ` entry ` function (that takes three content blocks
as arguments, for title, description and details).

Utilities to work with big rational numbers in Typst

` big-rati ` is a package to work with rational numbers in Typst

==  Usage



    #import "@preview/big-rati:0.1.0"

    #let a = 2      // 2/1
    #let b = (1, 2) // 1/2

    #let sum = big-rati.add(a, b) // 5/2

Functions, exported by the package are:



    // Converts `x` to bytes, representing the rational number,
    // that can be used in the functions below.
    // `x` might be an integer or a big integer string.

0.1.0

Postercise allows users to easily create academic research posters with
different themes using Typst.

_Postercise_ allows users to easily create academic research posters with
different themes using [ Typst ](https://typst.app/) .

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/dangh3014/postercise) ![GitHub
release \(latest by
date\)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/dangh3014/postercise) ![GitHub
Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dangh3014/postercise)

==  Getting started

You can get *Postercise* from the official package repository by entering
the following.



    #import "@preview/postercise:0.1.0": *


Another option is to use *Postercise* as a local module by downloading the
package files into your project folder.

Next you will need to import a theme, set up the page and font, and call the `
show ` command.



    #import themes.basic: *

    #set page(width: 24in, height: 18in)
    #set text(size: 24pt)

    #show: theme


To add content to the poster, use the ` poster-content ` command.



    #poster-content()[
      // Content goes here
    ]


There are a few options for types of content that should be added inside the `
poster-content ` . The body of the poster can be typed as normal, or two box
styles are provided to headings and/or highlight content in special ways.



    #normal-box[]
    #focus-box[]


Basic information like title and authors is placed as options using the `
poster-header ` script.



    #poster-header(
      title: [Title],
      authors: [Author],
    )


Finally, additional content can be added to the footer with the ` poster-
footer ` script.



    #poster-footer[]


Again, as a reminder, all of these scripts should be called from inside of the
` poster-content ` block.

Using these commands, it is easy to produce posters like the following:
![Examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dangh3014/postercise/main/examples/postercise-
examples.png)

==  More details

===  ` themes `

Currently, 3 themes are available. Use one of these ` import ` commands to
load that theme.



    #import themes.basic: *
    #import themes.better: *
    #import themes.boxes: *


===  ` show: theme.with() `

Theme options allow you to adjust the color scheme, as well as the color and
size of the content in the header. The defaults are shown below. (The
âbetter.typâ theme defaults to different titletext color and size.)



    #show: theme.with(
      primary-color: rgb(28,55,103), // Dark blue
      background-color: white,
      accent-color: rgb(243,163,30), // Yellow
      titletext-color: white,
      titletext-size: 2em,
    )


===  ` poster-content()[] `

The only option for the main content is the number of columns. This defaults
to 3 for most themes. For the âbetter.typâ theme, there is 1 column and
content is placed in the leftmost column below ` poster-header ` .



    #poster-content(col: 3)[
      // Content goes here
    ]


===  ` normal-box()[] ` and ` focus-box()[] `

By default, these boxes use the no fill and the accent-color fill,
respectively. However, they do accept color as an option, and will add a
primary-color stroke around the box if a color is given. For the
âbetter.typâ theme, use ` focus-box ` to place content in the center
column.



    #normal-box(color: none)[
      // Content
    ]

    #focus-box(color: none)[
      // Content
    ]


===  ` poster-header() `

Available options for the poster header for most themes are shown below. Note
that logos should be explicitly labeled as images. Logos are not currently
displayed in the header in the âbetter.typâ theme.



    #poster-header(
      title: [Title],
      subtitle: [Subtitle],
      author: [Author],
      affiliation: [Affiliation],
      logo-1: image("placeholder.png")
      logo-2: image("placeholder.png")
    )


===  ` poster-footer[] `

This command does not currently have any extra options. The content is
typically placed at the bottom of the poster, but it is placed in the
rightmost column for the âbetter.typâ theme.



    #poster-footer[
      // Content
    ]


==  Known Issues

  - The bibliography does not work properly and must be done manually
  - Figure captions do not number correctly and must be done manually

==  Planned Features/Themes

  - Themes that use color gradients and background images
  - Add QR code generation

0.0.1

LaTeX-like delimeter sizing in Typst

Get LaTeX-like delimeter sizing in Typst!

==  Usage



    #import "@preview/embiggen:0.0.1": *

    = embiggen

    Here's an equation of sorts:

    $ {lr(1/2x^2|)^(x=n)_(x=0) + (2x+3)} $

    And here are some bigger versions of it:

    $ {big(1/2x^2|)^(x=n)_(x=0) + big((2x+3))} $
    $ {Big(1/2x^2|)^(x=n)_(x=0) + Big((2x+3))} $
    $ {bigg(1/2x^2|)^(x=n)_(x=0) + bigg((2x+3))} $
    $ {Bigg(1/2x^2|)^(x=n)_(x=0) + Bigg((2x+3))} $

    And now, some smaller versions (#text([#link("https://x.com/tsoding/status/1756517251497255167", "cAn YoUr LaTeX dO tHaT?")], fill: rgb(50, 20, 200), font: "Noto Mono")):

    $ small(1/2x^2|)^(x=n)_(x=0) $
    $ Small(1/2x^2|)^(x=n)_(x=0) $
    $ smalll(1/2x^2|)^(x=n)_(x=0) $
    $ Smalll(1/2x^2|)^(x=n)_(x=0) $


==  Functions

===  big(â¦)

Applies a scale factor of ` 125% ` to ` #lr ` pre-determined scale. Delimeters
are enlarged by this amount compared to what ` #lr ` would normally do.

===  Big(â¦)

Like ` big(...) ` , but applies a scale factor of ` 156.25% ` .

===  bigg(â¦)

Like ` big(...) ` , but applies a scale factor of ` 195.313% ` .

===  Bigg(â¦)

Like ` big(...) ` , but applies a scale factor of ` 244.141% ` .

===  small(â¦)

Applies a scale factor of ` 80% ` to ` #lr ` pre-determined scale. Delimeters
are shrunk by this amount compared to what ` #lr ` would normally do. This
does _not_ exist in standard LaTeX, but is necessary in this package because
these functions scale the output of ` #lr ` , so delimeter sizes will get
larger depending on the content.

===  Small(â¦)

Like ` small(...) ` , but applies a scale factor of ` 64% ` .

===  smalll(â¦)

Like ` small(...) ` , but applies a scale factor of ` 51.2% ` .

===  Smalll(â¦)

Like ` small(...) ` , but applies a scale factor of ` 40.96% ` .

===  How to add

spirit but not pixel-perfect. As the PowerPoint template uses non-free fonts a
goal of this project is to more closely match the LaTeX TU Darmstadt Beamer
2023 template. Pull requests to improve this are really welcome.

0.1.0

A thesis template of the University of Turin

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=modern-unito-thesis&version=0.1.0)

This is a thesis template for the University of Turin (UniTO) based on [ my
thesis ](https://github.com/eduardz1/Bachelor-Thesis) , since there are no
strict templates (notable mention to [ Eugenioâs LaTeX template though
](https://github.com/esenes/Unito-thesis-template) ) take my choices with a
grain of salt, different supervisors may ask you to customize the template
differently. My choices are loosely based on this document: [ Indicazioni per
il Format della Tesi
](https://elearning.unito.it/sme/pluginfile.php/29485/mod_folder/content/0/format_TESI_2011-2012.pdf)
.

If you find errors or ways to improve the template please open an issue or
contribute directly with a PR.

==  Usage

In the Typst web app simply click âStart from templateâ on the dashboard
and search for ` modern-unito-thesis ` .

From the CLI you can initialize the project with the command



    typst init @preview/modern-unito-thesis


A new directory with all the files needed to get started will be created.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` template ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` title ` : the title of the thesis
  - ` academic-year ` : the academic year (e.g. 2023/2024)
  - ` subtitle ` : e.g. âBachelorâs Thesisâ
  - ` paper-size ` (default ` a4 ` ): the paper format
  - ` candidate ` : your name, surname and matricola (student id)
  - ` supervisor ` (relatore): your supervisorâs name and surname
  - ` co-supervisor ` (correlatore): an array of your co-supervisorsâ names and surnames
  - ` affiliation ` : a dictionary that specifies ` university ` , ` school ` and ` degree ` keywords
  - ` lang ` : configurable between ` en ` for English and ` it ` for Italian
  - ` bibliography-path ` : the path to your bibliography file (e.g. ` works.bib ` )
  - ` logo ` (already set to UniTOâs logo by default): the path to your universityâs logo
  - ` abstract ` : your thesisâ abstract, can be set to ` none ` if not needed
  - ` acknowledgments ` : your thesisâ acknowledgments, can be set to ` none ` if not needed
  - ` keywords ` : a list of keywords for the thesis, can be set to ` none ` if not needed

The template will initialize an example project with sensible defaults.

The template divides the level 1 headings in chapters under the ` chapters `
directory, I suggest using this structure to keep the project organized.

If you want to change an existing project to use this template, you can add a
show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/modern-unito-thesis:0.1.0": template

    #show: template.with(
      title: "My Beautiful Thesis",
      academic-year: [2023/2024],
      subtitle: "Bachelor's Thesis",
      logo: image("path/to/your/logo.png"),
      candidate: (
        name: "Eduard Antonovic Occhipinti",
        matricola: 947847
      ),
      supervisor: (
        "Prof. Luigi Paperino"
      ),
      co-supervisor: (
        "Dott. Pluto Mario",
        "Dott. Minni Topolino"
      ),
      affiliation: (
        university: "UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Torino",
        school: "Scuola di Scienze della Natura",
        degree: "Corso di Laurea Triennale in Informatica",
      ),
      bibliography: bibliography("works.yml"),
      abstract: [Your abstract goes here],
      acknowledgments: [Your acknowledgments go here],
      keywords: [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]
    )

    // Your content goes here


==  Compile

To compile the project from the CLI you just need to run



    typst compile main.typ


or if you want to watch for changes (recommended)



    typst watch main.typ


==  Bibliography

I integrated the bibliography as a [ Hayagriva
](https://github.com/typst/hayagriva) ` yaml ` file under [ works.yml
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/modern-unito-
thesis/0.1.0/template/works.yml) , nonetheless using the more common ` bib `
format for your bibliography management is as simple as passing a BibTex file
to the template ` bibliography ` parameter. Given that our university is not
strict in this regard I suggest using Hayagriva though :).

  - *pls* ` () ` \- plural short
plural short form

  - *pll* ` () ` \- plural long
plural long form

  - *pl* ` () ` \- plural automatic
plural. first occurence long form, then short

==  Why yet another Abbreviations package?

This mostly exists because I started working on it before checking if somebody
already made a package for it. After I saw that e.g. ` acrotastic ` exists, I
kept convincing myself a new package still makes sense for the following
reasons:

  - Getting to know Typst
  - More automatic handling than other packages
  - Ability to keep keys as [Content] instead of having to stringify everything

Especially the last part seems to lower the friction of writing for me. It
seems silly, I know.

0.1.1

Render LaTeX equation in typst using MathJax.

Render LaTeX equation in typst using MathJax.

*Note:* This package is made for fun and to demonstrate the capability of
typst plugins. And it is *slow* . To actually convert LaTeX equations to
typst ones, you should use *pandoc* or *texmath* .

![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/m-jaxon/0.1.1/mj.svg)



    #import "./typst-package/lib.typ" as m-jaxon
    // Uncomment the following line to use the m-jaxon from the official package registry
    // #import "@preview/m-jaxon:0.1.1"

    = M-Jaxon

    Typst, now with _MathJax_.

    The equation of mass-energy equivalence is often written as $E=m c^2$ in modern physics.

    But we can also write it using M-Jaxon as: #m-jaxon.render("E = mc^2", inline: true)



==  Limitations

  - The baseline of the inline equation still looks a bit off.

==  Documentation

===  ` render `

Render a LaTeX equation string to an svg image. Depending on the ` inline `
argument, the image will be rendered as an inline image or a block image.

====  Arguments

  - ` src ` : ` str ` or ` raw ` block - The LaTeX equation string
  - ` inline ` : ` bool ` \- Whether to render the image as an inline image or a block image

====  Returns

The image, of type ` content `

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` m-jaxon `



    #import "@preview/m-jaxon:0.1.1"

0.3.1

Customizable dropped capitals.

A package for creating dropped capitals.

==  Usage

This package exports a single ` dropcap ` function that is used to create
dropped capitals. The function takes one or two positional arguments, and
several optional keyword arguments for customization:

Parameter  |  Type  |  Description  |  Default
---|---|---|---
` height ` |  ` integer ` , ` length ` , ` auto ` |  The height of the dropped capital.  |  ` 2 `
` justify ` |  ` boolean ` , ` auto ` |  Whether the text should be justified.  |  ` auto `
` gap ` |  ` length ` |  The space between the dropped capital and the text.  |  ` 0pt `
` hanging-indent ` |  ` length ` |  The indent of lines after the first.  |  ` 0pt `
` overhang ` |  ` length ` , ` relative ` , ` ratio ` |  How much the dropped capital should hang into the margin.  |  ` 0pt `
` depth ` |  ` integer ` , ` length ` |  The space below the dropped capital.  |  ` 0pt `
` transform ` |  ` function ` , ` none ` |  A function to be applied to the dropped capital.  |  ` none `
` ..text-args ` |  |  How to style the ` text ` of the dropped capital.  |

Some parameters allow values of different types for maximum flexibility:

  - If ` height ` is given as an integer, it is interpreted as a number of lines. If given as ` auto ` , the dropped capital will not be scaled and remain at its original size.
  - If ` overhang ` has a relative part, it is resolved relative to the width of the dropped capital.
  - If ` depth ` is given as an integer, it is interpreted as a number of lines.
  - The ` transform ` function takes the extracted or passed dropped capital and returns the content to be shown.

If two positional arguments are given, the first is used as the dropped
capital, and the second as the text. If only one argument is given, the
dropped capital is automatically extracted from the text.

===  Extraction

If no explicit dropped capital is passed, it is extracted automatically. For
this to work, the package looks into the content making up the first paragraph
and extracts the first letter of the first word. This letter is then split off
from the rest of the text and used as the dropped capital. There are some
special cases to consider:

  - If the first element of the paragraph is a ` box ` , the whole box is used as the dropped capital.
  - If the first element is a list or enum item, it is assumed that the literal meaning of the list or enum syntax was intended, and the number or bullet is used as the dropped capital.

Affixes, such as punctuation, super- and subscripts, quotes, and spaces will
also be detected and stay with the dropped capital.

===  Paragraph Splitting

To wrap the text around the dropped capital, the paragraph is split into two
parts: the part next to the dropped capital and the part after it. As Typst
doesnât natively support wrapping text around an element, this package
splits the paragraph at word boundaries and tries to fit as much in the first
part as possible. This approach comes with some limitations:

  - The paragraph is split at word boundaries, which makes hyphenation across the split impossible.
  - Some elements cannot be properly split, such as containers, lists, and context expressions.
  - The approach uses a greedy algorithm, which might not always find the optimal split.
  - If the split happens at a block element, the spacing between the two parts might be off.

To determine whether an elements fits into the first part, the position of top
edge of the element is crucial. If the top edge is above the baseline of the
dropped capital, the element is considered to be part of the first part. This
means that elements with a large height will be part of the first part. This
is done to avoid gaps between the two parts of the paragraph.

===  Styling

In case you wish to style the dropped capital more than what is possible with
the arguments of the ` text ` function, you can use a ` transform ` function.
This function takes the extracted or passed dropped capital and returns the
content to be shown. The function is provided with the context of the dropped
capital.

Note that when using ` em ` units, they are resolved relative to the font size
of the dropped capital. When the dropped capital is scaled to fit the given `
height ` parameter, the font size is adjusted so that the _bounds_ of the
transformed content match the given height. For that, the ` top-edge ` and `
bottom-edge ` parameters of ` text-args ` are set to ` bounds ` by default.

==  Example



    #import "@preview/droplet:0.3.1": dropcap

    #set par(justify: true)

    #dropcap(
      height: 3,
      gap: 4pt,
      hanging-indent: 1em,
      overhang: 8pt,
      font: "Curlz MT",
    )[

0.1.0

Exercise template for TU Darmstadt (Technische UniversitÃ¤t Darmstadt).

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=athena-tu-darmstadt-
exercise&version=0.1.0)

These *unofficial* templates can be used to write in [ Typst
](https://github.com/typst/typst) with the corporate design of [ TU Darmstadt
](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/) .

====  Disclaimer

Please ask your supervisor if you are allowed to use typst and this template
for your thesis or other documents. Note that this template is not checked by
TU Darmstadt for correctness. Thus, this template does not guarantee
completeness or correctness. Also, note that submission in TUbama requires
PDF/A which typst currently canât export to ( [
https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2942
](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2942) ). You can use a converter to
convert from the typst output to PDF/A, but check that there are no losses
during the conversion. CMYK color space support may be required for printing
which is also currently not supported by typst ( [
https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2942
](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2942) ), but this is not relevant when
you just submit online.

==  Implemented Templates

The templates imitate the style of the corresponding latex templates in [
tuda_latex_templates ](https://github.com/tudace/tuda_latex_templates) . Note
that there can be visual differences between the original latex template and
the typst template (you may open an issue when you find one).

For missing features, ideas or other problems you can just open an issue
:wink:. Contributions are also welcome.

==  Usage

Create a new typst project based on this template locally.



    # for tudapub
    typst init @preview/athena-tu-darmstadt-thesis
    cd athena-tu-darmstadt-thesis

    # for tudaexercise
    typst init @preview/athena-tu-darmstadt-exercise
    cd athena-tu-darmstadt-exercise


Or create a project on the typst web app based on this template.

Or do a manual installation of this template.  For a manual setup create a
folder for your writing project and download this template into the
`templates` folder:



    mkdir my_exercise && cd my_exercise
    git clone https://github.com/JeyRunner/tuda-typst-templates


===  Logo and Font Setup

Download the tud logo from [ download.hrz.tu-
darmstadt.de/protected/ULB/tuda_logo.pdf ](https://download.hrz.tu-
darmstadt.de/protected/ULB/tuda_logo.pdf) and put it into the ` asssets/logos
` folder. Now execute the following script in the ` asssets/logos ` folder to
convert it into an svg:



    cd asssets/logos
    ./convert_logo.sh


Note: The here used ` pdf2svg ` command might not be available. In this case
we recommend a online converter like [ PDF24 Tools
](https://tools.pdf24.org/en/pdf-to-svg) . There also is a [ tool
](https://github.com/FussballAndy/typst-img-to-local) to install images as
local typst packages.

Also download the required fonts ` Roboto ` and ` XCharter ` :



    cd asssets/fonts
    ./download_fonts.sh


Optionally you can install all fonts in the folders in ` fonts ` on your
system. But you can also use Typstâs ` --font-path ` option. Or install them
in a folder and add the folder to ` TYPST_FONT_PATHS ` for a single font
folder.

Note: wget might not be available. In this case either download it or replace
the command with something like ` curl <url> -o <filename> -L `

Create a main.typ file for the manual template installation.  Create a simple
`main.typ` in the root folder (`my_exercise`) of your new project:



    #import "tuda-typst-templates/templates/tudaexercise/template/lib.typ": *

    #show: tudaexercise.with(
      info: (
        title: "My Exercise",
        auhtor: "Your name",
        sheetnumber: 1
      ),
      logo: image("tuda-typst-templates/assets/logos/tuda_logo.svg")
    )

    = My First Task
    Some Text


===  Compile you typst file



    typst --watch main.typ --font-path asssets/fonts/


This will watch your file and recompile it to a pdf when the file is saved.
For writing, you can use [ Vscode ](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with these
extensions: [ Tinymist Typst
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist)
. Or use the [ typst web app ](https://typst.app/) (here you need to upload
the logo and the fonts).

Note that we add ` --font-path ` to ensure that the correct fonts are used.
Due to a bug (typst/typst#2917 typst/typst#2098) typst sometimes uses the font
` Roboto condensed ` instead of ` Roboto ` . To be on the safe side, double-
check the embedded fonts in the pdf (there should be no ` Roboto condensed `
). What also works is to uninstall/deactivate all ` Roboto condensed ` fonts
from your system.

=  ttt-exam

0.1.2

A collection of tools to make a teachers life easier (german).

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=ttt-exam&version=0.1.2)

` ttt-exam ` is a _template_ to create exams and belongs to the [ typst-
teacher-tools-collection ](https://github.com/jomaway/typst-teacher-templates)
.

==  Usage

Run this command inside your terminal to init a new exam.



    typst init @preview/ttt-exam my-exam


This will scaffold the following folder structure.



    my-exam/
    ââ meta.toml
    ââ exam.typ
    ââ eval.typ
    ââ justfile
    ââ logo.jpg


Replace the ` logo.jpg ` with your schools, university, â¦ logo or remove it.
Then edit the ` meta.toml ` . Edit the ` exam.typ ` and replace the questions
with your own. If you like you can also remove the ` meta.toml ` file and
specify the values directly inside ` exam.typ `

If you have installed [ just ](https://just.systems/) you can use it to build
a _student_ and _teacher_ version of your exam by running ` just build ` .

Here you can see an example with both versions. On the left the student
version and on the right the teachers version.

![Thumbnail with both
versions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jomaway/typst-teacher-
templates/main/ttt-exam/thumbnail.png)

The ` eval.typ ` is a template for generating grade lists. You need to add
your students to ` meta.toml ` and add the total amount of points.

==  Features

You can pass the following arguments to ` exam `



    #let exam(
      // metadata
      logo: none, // none | image
      title: "exam", // the title of the exam

0.1.0

Easy styling for different link types like mails and urls.

Package for easy styling of links. See [ Docs
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/kinase/0.1.0/docs/manual.pdf)
for a detailed guide. Below is an example of the functionality that is added.
The problem the package solves is that different link types cannot be styled
seperatly, but are recognized as such. This package allows for easy styling of
phone numbers, urls and mail addresses. It provides helper functions that
return regex patterns for the most common use cases.



    #import "@previes/kinase:0.0.1"

    #show: make-link

    // Insert some rules
    #update-link-style(key: l-mailto(), value: it => strong(it), )

= *numberingx.md*

=  numberingx

0.0.1

Extended numbering patterns using the CSS Counter Styles spec

_Extended numbering patterns using the[ CSS Counter Styles
](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-counter-styles-3/) specification, along with a
number of [ Ready-made Counter Styles ](https://www.w3.org/TR/predefined-
counter-styles/) . _

==  Usage



    // numberingx is expected to be imported with the syntax creating a named module
    #import "@preview/numberingx:0.0.1"

    // Use full-width roman numerals for titles, and lowercase ukrainian letters
    #set heading(numbering: numberingx.formatter(
      "{fullwidth-upper-roman}.{fullwidth-lower-roman}.{lower-ukrainian}"
    ))


===  Patterns

numberingxâs patterns are similiar to typstâs [ numbering patterns
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/numbering/) and use the same notion of
fragments with a prefix and a final suffix. The main difference is that it
doesnât use special characters and all numbering styles must be written
within braces. To insert a literal brace, you can double it.

A list of patterns can be found in the [ Ready-made Counter Styles
](https://www.w3.org/TR/predefined-counter-styles/) document. Additionally,
numberingx allows typstâs numbering characters to be used in patterns. This
way, ` "{upper-roman}.{decimal})" ` can be shortened to ` "{I}.{1})" ` .

===  API

numberingx exposes two functions, ` format ` and ` formatter ` .

====  ` format(fmt, styles: (:), ..nums) `

This function uses the same api as typstâs ` numbering() ` and takes the
pattern string as its first positional argument, and numbers as trailing
arguments. An optional ` styles ` argument allows for [ user-defined styles
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/numberingx/0.0.1/#user-
defined-styles) .

====  ` formatter(fmt, styles: (:)) `

This function is little more than a shorter version of ` format.with(..) ` .
It takes a pattern string and an optional ` styles ` argument, and return the
matching numbering functions. This is mainly intended to be used for ` #set `
rules.

==  User-defined styles

Custom styles can be defined according to the [ CSS Counter Styles
](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-counter-styles-3/) spec and passed through a `
styles ` named argument to ` format ` and ` formatter ` . It must be a
dictionary mapping style names to style descriptions.

Note that the ` prefix ` , ` suffix ` , ` pad ` , and ` speak-as ` descriptors
are not supported, nor is the ` extends ` system.

---|---
![Default colors](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/modern-resume/0.1.0/docs/images/demo-navy-dark.png) |  ![Pink colors](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/modern-resume/0.1.0/docs/images/demo-pink.png)

==  Customization

Note: customization is currently only supported when cloning the template
locally. Allowing customization via a âTypst universeâ-installed template
is a feature that is actively worked on.

The template allows you to make it yours by defining a custom color palette.
Customize the color theme by changing the values of the ` color ` dictionary
in [ lib.typ
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/modern-
resume/0.1.0/lib.typ) . For example:

  - The default color palette:

        #let colors = (
      primary: rgb("#313C4E"),
      secondary: rgb("#222A33"),
      accent-color: rgb("#449399"),
      text-primary: black,
      text-secondary: rgb("#7C7C7C"),
      text-tertiary: white,
    )


  - A pink color palette:

        #let colors = (
      primary: rgb("#e755e0"),
      secondary: rgb("#ad00c2"),
      accent-color: rgb("#00d032"),
      text-primary: black,

= *spreet.md*

=  spreet

0.1.0

Parse a spreadsheet.

Spreet is a spreadsheet decoder for typst (excel/opendocument spreadsheets).
The spreadsheet will be read and parsed into a dictonary of 2-dimensional
array of strings: Each workbook in the spreadsheet is mapped as an entry in
the dictonary. Each row of the workbook is represented as an array of strings,
and all rows are summarised in a single array.

==  Example



    #import "@preview/spreet:0.1.0"

    #let excel_data = spreet.file-decode("excel.xlsx")
    #let opendocument_data = spreet.file-decode("opendocument.ods")

    #let excel_data_from_bytes = spreet.decode(read("excel.xlsx", encoding: none))
    #let opendocument_data_from_bytes = spreet.decode(read("opendocument.ods", encoding: none))

    /*
    excel_data or opendocument_data contains a dict of all worksheets
    (
      Worksheet1: (
        (Row1_Column1, Row1_Column2),

= *delimitizer.md*

=  delimitizer

0.1.0

Customize the size of delimiters. Like \big, \Big, \bigg, \Bigg in LaTeX.

This package lets you customize the size of delimiters in your math equations.
It is useful when you want to make your equations more readable by increasing
the size of certain delimiters. Just like ` \big ` , ` \Big ` , ` \bigg ` ,
and ` \Bigg ` in LaTeX, ` delimitizer ` provides you with the same
functionality in Typst.

  - ` big(delimiter) ` : Makes the delimiters bigger than the default size.
  - ` Big(delimiter) ` : Makes the delimiters bigger than ` big() ` .
  - ` bigg(delimiter) ` : Makes the delimiters bigger than ` Big() ` .
  - ` Bigg(delimiter) ` : Makes the delimiters bigger than ` bigg() ` .
  - ` scaled-delimiter(delimiter, size) ` : Scales the delimiters by a factor of your choice.
  - ` paired-delimiter(left, right) ` : Make a short hand for paired delimiters. This function returns a closure ` f(size = auto: auto | none | big | Big | bigg | Bigg | relative, content: content) ` . The keyed argument ` size ` is optional and defaults to ` auto ` . The positional argument ` content ` is required.
    - when ` size ` is ` auto ` , the size of the delimiters is automatically determined.
    - when ` size ` is ` none ` , the size of the delimiters is ` 1em ` .
    - when ` size ` is ` big ` / ` Big ` / ` bigg ` / ` Bigg ` , the size of the delimiters is set to ` big ` / ` Big ` / ` bigg ` / ` Bigg ` respectively.
    - when ` size ` is ` relative ` length like ` 3em ` or ` 150% ` , the size of the delimiters is scaled by the factor you provide.

Example:



    #let parn = paired-delimiter("(", ")")

    $
    parn(size: bigg,
      parn(size: big, (a+b)times (a-b))
    div
      parn(size: big, (c+d)times (c-d))
    ) + d \ = (a^2-b^2) / (c^2-d^2)+d
    $

= *valkyrie.md*

=  valkyrie

0.2.1

Type safe type validation

Version 0.2.1

This package implements type validation, and is targeted mainly at package and
template developers. The desired outcome is that it becomes easier for the
programmer to quickly put a package together without spending a long time on
type safety, but also to make the usage of those packages by end-users less
painful by generating useful error messages.

==  Example Usage



    #import "@preview/valkyrie:0.2.1" as z

    #let my-schema = z.dictionary((
        should-be-string: z.string(),
        complicated-tuple: z.tuple(
          z.email(),
          z.ip(),
          z.either(
            z.string(),
            z.number(),
          ),
        ),
      )
    )

    #z.parse(
      (
        should-be-string: "This doesn't error",
        complicated-tuple: (
          "neither@does-this.com",
          // Error: Schema validation failed on argument.complicated-tuple.1:
          //        String must be a valid IP address
          "NOT AN IP",
          1,
        ),
      ),
      my-schema,
    )

= *xarrow.md*

=  xarrow

0.3.1

Variable-length arrows in Typst.

Variable-length arrows in Typst, fitting the width of a given content.

==  Usage

This library mainly provides the ` xarrow ` function. This function takes one
positional argument, which is the content to display on top of the arrow.
Additionally, the library provides the following arrow styles:

  - ` xarrowDashed ` using arrow ` sym.arrow.dashed ` .
  - ` xarrowDouble ` using arrow ` sym.arrow.double.long ` ;
  - ` xarrowHook ` using arrow ` sym.arrow.hook ` ;
  - ` xarrowSquiggly ` using arrow ` sym.arrow.long.squiggly ` ;
  - ` xarrowTwoHead ` using arrow ` sym.arrow.twohead ` ;
  - â¦

These names use camlCase in order to be simply called from math mode. This may
change in the future, if it becomes possible to have the function names mirror
the dot-separated name of the symbols themselves.

===  Arguments

Users can provide the following arguments to any of the previously-mentioned
functions:

  - ` width ` defines the width of the arrow. It defaults to ` auto ` , which makes the arrow adapt to the size of the body.
  - ` margins ` defines the spacing on each side of the ` body ` argument. Ignored when ` width ` is not ` auto ` .
  - ` position ` defines whether the main ` body ` argument will be set above or below the arrow. Default is ` top ` ; the only other accepted value is ` bottom ` .
  - ` opposite ` sets the content that is displayed on the other, non-default side of the arrow. Default is ` none ` .

===  Example



    #import "@preview/xarrow:0.3.0": xarrow, xarrowSquiggly, xarrowTwoHead

    $
      a xarrow(sym: <--, QQ\, 1 + 1^4) b \
      c xarrowSquiggly("very long boi") d \
      c / ( a xarrowTwoHead("NP" limits(sum)^*) b times 4)
    $


==  Customisation

The ` xarrow ` function has several named arguments which serve to create new
arrow designs:

  - ` sym ` is the base symbol.
  - ` sections ` defines the way the symbol is divided. Drawing an arrow consists of drawing its tail, then repeating a central part that is defined by ` sections ` , then drawing the head. This is the parameter that has to be tweaked if observing artefacts. ` sections ` are given as two ratios, delimiting respectively the beginning and the end of the central, repeated part of the symbol.
  - ` partial_repeats ` indicates whether the central part of the symbol can be partially repeated at the end in order to match the exact desired width. This has to be disabled when the repeated part has a clear period (like the squiggly arrow).

===  Example



    #let xarrowSquigglyBottom = xarrow.with(
      sym: sym.arrow.long.squiggly,
      sections: (20%, 45%),
      partial_repeats: false,
      position: bottom,
    )


==  Limitations

  - The predefined arrows are tweaked with the Computer Modern Math font in mind. With different glyphs, more sophisticated arrows will require manual modifications (of the ` sections ` argument) to be rendered correctly.
  - The ` width ` argument cannot be given ratio/fractions like other shapes. This would be a nice feature to have, in order to be able to create an arrow that takes 50% of the available line width for instance.
  - I would like to make a proper manual for this library in the future, using something cool like [ mantys ](https://github.com/jneug/typst-mantys) .

===  How to add

0.3.0

A highly efficient random number generator for Typst

Featured  Package

[ Suiji ](https://github.com/liuguangxi/suiji) (éæº in Chinese, /suÃ­jÄ«/,
meaning random) is a high efficient random number generator in Typst. Partial
algorithm is inherited from [ GSL ](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl) and most
APIs are similar to [ NumPy Random Generator
](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generator.html) . It provides
pure function implementation and does not rely on any global state variables,
resulting in better performance and independency.

==  Features

  - All functions are immutable, which means results of random are completely deterministic.
  - Core random engine chooses âMaximally equidistributed combined Tausworthe generatorâ and âLCGâ.
  - Generate random integers or floats from various distribution.
  - Randomly shuffle an array of objects.
  - Randomly sample from an array of objects.
  - Generate blind text of Simplified Chinese.

==  Examples

The example below uses ` suiji ` and ` cetz ` packages to create a trajectory
of a random walk.



    #import "@preview/suiji:0.3.0": *
    #import "@preview/cetz:0.2.2"

    #set page(width: auto, height: auto, margin: 0.5cm)

    #cetz.canvas(length: 5pt, {
      import cetz.draw: *

      let n = 2000
      let (x, y) = (0, 0)
      let (x-new, y-new) = (0, 0)
      let rng = gen-rng(42)
      let v = ()

      for i in range(n) {
        (rng, v) = uniform(rng, low: -2.0, high: 2.0, size: 2)
        (x-new, y-new) = (x - v.at(1), y - v.at(0))
        let col = color.mix((blue.transparentize(20%), 1-i/n), (green.transparentize(20%), i/n))
        line(stroke: (paint: col, cap: "round", thickness: 2pt),
          (x, y), (x-new, y-new)
        )
        (x, y) = (x-new, y-new)
      }
    })


![random-
walk](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/suiji/0.3.0/examples/random-

      for c in range(num-col) {
        (rng, num-cnt) = integers(rng, low: 1, high: 3)
        for cnt in range(num-cnt) {
          (rng, val) = integers(rng, low: -10, high: num-row - 2)
          (rng, chars) = choice(rng, seq, size: text-len)
          for i in range(text-len) {
            let y = i + val
            if y >= 0 and y < num-row {
              let col = green.transparentize((i / text-len) * 100%)
              content(

==  Usage

Import ` suiji ` module first before use any random functions from it.



    #import "@preview/suiji:0.3.0": *


For functions that generate various random numbers or randomly shuffle, a
random number generator object ( *rng* ) is required as both input and
output arguments. And the original *rng* should be created by function `
gen-rng ` , with an integer as the argument of seed. This calling style seems
to be a little inconvenient, as it is limited by the programming paradigm. For
function ` discrete ` , the given probalilities of the discrete events should
be preprocessed by function ` discrete-preproc ` , whose output serves as an
input argument of ` discrete ` .

Another set of functions with the same functionality provides higher
performance (about 3 times faster) and has the suffix ` -f ` in their names.
For example, ` gen-rng-f ` and ` integers-f ` are the fast versions of ` gen-
rng ` and ` integers ` , respectively.

The function ` rand-sc ` creates blind text of Simplified Chinese. This
function yields a Chinese-like Lorem Ipsum blind text with the given number of
words, where punctuations are optional.

The code below generates several random permutations of 0 to 9. Each time
after function ` shuffle-f ` is called, the value of variable ` rng ` is
updated, so generated permutations are different.



    #{
      let rng = gen-rng-f(42)
      let a = ()
      for i in range(5) {
        (rng, a) = shuffle-f(rng, range(10))
        [#(a.map(it => str(it)).join("  ")) \ ]
      }
    }

0.3.2

Typst-setting finite automata with CeTZ

Featured  Package

*finite* is a [ Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) package for
rendering finite automata on top of [ CeTZ ](https://github.com/johannes-
wolf/typst-canvas) .

==  Usage

For Typst 0.6.0 or later, import the package from the typst preview
repository:



    #import "@preview/finite:0.3.2": automaton


After importing the package, simply call ` #automaton() ` with a dictionary
holding a transition table:



    #import "@preview/finite:0.3.2": automaton

    #automaton((
      q0: (q1:0, q0:"0,1"),
      q1: (q0:(0,1), q2:"0"),
      q2: (),
    ))

0.5.3

A powerful package for creating presentation slides in Typst.

Featured  Package

[ Touying ](https://github.com/touying-typ/touying) (æå½± in chinese,
/tÃ³uyÇng/, meaning projection) is a user-friendly, powerful and efficient
package for creating presentation slides in Typst. Partial code is inherited
from [ Polylux ](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/polylux) . Therefore,
some concepts and APIs remain consistent with Polylux.

Touying provides automatically injected global configurations, which is
convenient for configuring themes. Besides, Touying does not rely on ` counter
` and ` context ` to implement ` #pause ` , resulting in better performance.

If you like it, consider [ giving a star on GitHub
](https://github.com/touying-typ/touying) . Touying is a community-driven
project, feel free to suggest any ideas and contribute.

==  Quick start

Before you begin, make sure you have installed the Typst environment. If not,
you can use the [ Web App ](https://typst.app/) or the [ Tinymist LSP
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist)
extensions for VS Code.

To use Touying, you only need to include the following code in your document:



    #import "@preview/touying:0.5.3": *
    #import themes.simple: *

    #show: simple-theme.with(aspect-ratio: "16-9")

    = Title

    == First Slide

    Hello, Touying!

    #pause

    Hello, Typst!


![image](https://github.com/touying-
typ/touying/assets/34951714/f5bdbf8f-7bf9-45fd-9923-0fa5d66450b2)

Itâs simple. Congratulations on creating your first Touying slide! ð

*Tip:* You can use Typst syntax like ` #import "config.typ": * ` or `
#include "content.typ" ` to implement Touyingâs multi-file architecture.

==  More Complex Examples

In fact, Touying provides various styles for writing slides. For example, the
above example uses first-level and second-level titles to create new slides.
However, you can also use the ` #slide[..] ` format to access more powerful
features provided by Touying.



    #import "@preview/touying:0.5.3": *
    #import themes.university: *
    #import "@preview/cetz:0.2.2"
    #import "@preview/fletcher:0.5.1" as fletcher: node, edge
    #import "@preview/ctheorems:1.1.2": *
    #import "@preview/numbly:0.1.0": numbly

    // cetz and fletcher bindings for touying
    #let cetz-canvas = touying-reducer.with(reduce: cetz.canvas, cover: cetz.draw.hide.with(bounds: true))
    #let fletcher-diagram = touying-reducer.with(reduce: fletcher.diagram, cover: fletcher.hide)

    // Theorems configuration by ctheorems
    #show: thmrules.with(qed-symbol: $square$)
    #let theorem = thmbox("theorem", "Theorem", fill: rgb("#eeffee"))
    #let corollary = thmplain(
      "corollary",
      "Corollary",
      base: "theorem",
      titlefmt: strong
    )
    #let definition = thmbox("definition", "Definition", inset: (x: 1.2em, top: 1em))
    #let example = thmplain("example", "Example").with(numbering: none)
    #let proof = thmproof("proof", "Proof")

    #show: university-theme.with(
      aspect-ratio: "16-9",
      // config-common(handout: true),
      config-info(
        title: [Title],
        subtitle: [Subtitle],
        author: [Authors],
        date: datetime.today(),
        institution: [Institution],
        logo: emoji.school,
      ),
    )

    #set heading(numbering: numbly("{1}.", default: "1.1"))

    #title-slide()

    == Outline <touying:hidden>

    #components.adaptive-columns(outline(title: none, indent: 1em))

    = Animation

    == Simple Animation

    We can use `#pause` to #pause display something later.

    #pause

    Just like this.

    #meanwhile

    Meanwhile, #pause we can also use `#meanwhile` to #pause display other content synchronously.

    #speaker-note[
      + This is a speaker note.
      + You won't see it unless you use `config-common(show-notes-on-second-screen: right)`
    ]


    == Complex Animation

    At subslide #touying-fn-wrapper((self: none) => str(self.subslide)), we can

    use #uncover("2-")[`#uncover` function] for reserving space,

    use #only("2-")[`#only` function] for not reserving space,

    #alternatives[call `#only` multiple times \u{2717}][use `#alternatives` function #sym.checkmark] for choosing one of the alternatives.


    == Callback Style Animation

    #slide(repeat: 3, self => [
      #let (uncover, only, alternatives) = utils.methods(self)

      At subslide #self.subslide, we can

      use #uncover("2-")[`#uncover` function] for reserving space,

      use #only("2-")[`#only` function] for not reserving space,

      #alternatives[call `#only` multiple times \u{2717}][use `#alternatives` function #sym.checkmark] for choosing one of the alternatives.
    ])


    == Math Equation Animation

    Equation with `pause`:

    $
      f(x) &= pause x^2 + 2x + 1  \
           &= pause (x + 1)^2  \
    $

    #meanwhile

    Here, #pause we have the expression of $f(x)$.

    #pause

    By factorizing, we can obtain this result.


    == CeTZ Animation

    CeTZ Animation in Touying:

    #cetz-canvas({
      import cetz.draw: *

      rect((0,0), (5,5))

      (pause,)

      rect((0,0), (1,1))
      rect((1,1), (2,2))
      rect((2,2), (3,3))

      (pause,)

      line((0,0), (2.5, 2.5), name: "line")
    })


    == Fletcher Animation

    Fletcher Animation in Touying:

    #fletcher-diagram(
      node-stroke: .1em,
      node-fill: gradient.radial(blue.lighten(80%), blue, center: (30%, 20%), radius: 80%),
      spacing: 4em,
      edge((-1,0), "r", "-|>", `open(path)`, label-pos: 0, label-side: center),
      node((0,0), `reading`, radius: 2em),
      edge((0,0), (0,0), `read()`, "--|>", bend: 130deg),
      pause,
      edge(`read()`, "-|>"),
      node((1,0), `eof`, radius: 2em),
      pause,
      edge(`close()`, "-|>"),
      node((2,0), `closed`, radius: 2em, extrude: (-2.5, 0)),
      edge((0,0), (2,0), `close()`, "-|>", bend: -40deg),
    )


    = Theorems

    == Prime numbers

    #definition[
      A natural number is called a #highlight[_prime number_] if it is greater
      than 1 and cannot be written as the product of two smaller natural numbers.
    ]
    #example[
      The numbers $2$, $3$, and $17$ are prime.
      @cor_largest_prime shows that this list is not exhaustive!
    ]

    #theorem("Euclid")[
      There are infinitely many primes.
    ]
    #proof[
      Suppose to the contrary that $p_1, p_2, dots, p_n$ is a finite enumeration
      of all primes. Set $P = p_1 p_2 dots p_n$. Since $P + 1$ is not in our list,
      it cannot be prime. Thus, some prime factor $p_j$ divides $P + 1$.  Since
      $p_j$ also divides $P$, it must divide the difference $(P + 1) - P = 1$, a
      contradiction.
    ]

    #corollary[
      There is no largest prime number.
    ] <cor_largest_prime>
    #corollary[
      There are infinitely many composite numbers.
    ]

    #theorem[
      There are arbitrarily long stretches of composite numbers.
    ]

    #proof[
      For any $n > 2$, consider $
        n! + 2, quad n! + 3, quad ..., quad n! + n #qedhere
      $

=  meppp

0.2.1

Template for modern physics experiment reports at the Physics School of PKU.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=meppp&version=0.2.1)

A simple template for modern physics experiments (MPE) courses at the Physics
School of PKU.

==  meppp-lab-report

The recommended report format of MPE course. Default arguments are shown as
below:



    #import "@preview/meppp:0.2.1": *

    #let meppp-lab-report(
      title: "",
      author: "",
      info: [],
      abstract: [],
      keywords: (),
      author-footnote: [],
      heading-numbering-array: ("I" ,"A", "1", "a"),
      heading-suffix: ". ",
      doc,
    ) = ...


  - ` title ` is the title of the report.
  - ` author ` is the name of the author.
  - ` info ` is a line (or lines) of brief information of author and the report (e.g. student ID, school, experiment dateâ¦)
  - ` abstract ` is the abstract of the report, not shown when it is empty.
  - ` keywords ` are keywords of the report, only shown when the abstract is shown.
  - ` author-footnote ` is the phone number or the e-mail of the author, shown in the footnote.
  - ` heading-numbering-array ` is the heading numbering of each level. Only shows the numbering of the deepest level.
  - ` heading-suffix ` is the suffix of headings

It is recommended to use ` #show ` to use the template:



    #show: meppp-lab-report.with(
        title: [Test title],
        ..args
    )
    ...your report below.


==  meppp-tl-table

Modify your input ` table ` to a three-lined table (AIP style), returned as a
` figure ` . Double-lines above and below the table, and a single line below
the header.



    #let meppp-tl-table(
      caption: none,
      supplement: auto,
      stroke: 0.5pt,
      tbl
    ) = ...


  - ` caption ` is the caption above the table, center-aligned
  - ` supplement ` is same as the supplement in the figure.
  - ` stroke ` is the stroke used in the three lines (maybe five lines).
  - ` tbl ` is the input table, which must contains a ` table.header `

Example:



    #meppp-tl-table(
      table(
        columns: 4,
        rows: 2,
        table.header([Item1], [Item2], [Item3], [Item4]),
        [Data1], [Data2], [Data3], [Data4],
      )
    )


==  subfigure

Counts subfigures and displays in the figure, mostly used when inserting
multiple images.



    #let subfigure(
      body,
      caption: none,
      numbering: "(a)",
      inside: true,
      dx: 10pt,
      dy: 10pt,
      boxargs: (fill: white, inset: 5pt),
      alignment: top + left,
    ) = ...


==  pku-logo

The logo of PKU, returned as a ` image `



    #let pku-logo(..args) = image("pkulogo.png", ..args)


Example:



    #pku-logo(width: 50%)
    #pku-logo()

        align(right, emph(hydra(1)))
      } else {
        align(left, emph(hydra(2)))
      }
      line(length: 100%)
    })
    #set heading(numbering: "1.1")
    #show heading.where(level: 1): it => pagebreak(weak: true) + it

0.1.0

An IFAC-style paper template to publish at conferences for International
Federation of Automatic Control

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=abiding-ifacconf&version=0.1.0)

==  (unofficial) IFAC Conference Template for Typst

IFAC stands for [ International Federation of Automatic Control
](https://ifac-control.org/) . This repository is meant to be a port of the
existing author tools for conference papers (e.g., for LaTeX, see [
ifacconf_latex.zip ](https://www.ifac-control.org/conferences/author-
guide/copy_of_ifacconf_latex.zip/view) ) for Typst.

==  Usage

Running the following command will create a new directory with all the files
that are needed:



    typst init @preview/abiding-ifacconf


==  Configuration

This template exports the ` ifacconf ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` authors ` : (default: ()) array of authors. For each author you can specify a name, email (optional), and affiliation. The affiliation must be an integer corresponding to an entry in the 1-indexed affiliations list (or 0 for no affiliation).
  - ` affiliations ` : (default: ()) array of affiliations. For each affiliation you can specify a department, organization, and address. Everything is optional (i.e., an affiliation can be an empty array).
  - ` abstract ` : (default: none) the paperâs abstract. Can be omitted if you donât have one.
  - ` keywords ` : (default: ()) array of keywords to display after the abstract
  - ` sponsor ` : (default: none) acknowledgment of sponsor or financial support (appears as a footnote on the first page)

==  Minimal Working Example



    #import "@preview:abiding-ifacconf:0.1.0": *
    #show: ifacconf-rules
    #show: ifacconf.with(
      title: "Minimal Working Example",
      authors: (
        (
          name: "First A. Author",
          email: "author@boulder.nist.gov",
          affiliation: 1,
        ),
      ),
      affiliations: (
        (
          department: "Engineering",
          organization: "National Institute of Standards and Technology",
          address: "Boulder, CO 80305 USA",
        ),
      ),
      abstract: [
        Abstract should be 50-100 words.
      ],
      keywords: ("keyword1", "keyword2"),
      sponsor: [
        Sponsor information.
      ],
    )

    = Introduction

    A minimum working example (with bibliography) @Abl56.

    #lorem(80)

    #lorem(80)

    #bibliography("refs.bib")


==  Full(er) Example

See [ ` main.typ ` ](https://github.com/avonmoll/ifacconf-
typst/blob/main/template/main.typ) .

==  Dependencies

  - typst 0.11.0
  - ctheorems 1.1.0 (a Typst package for handling theorem-like environments)

==  Notes, features, etc.

  - the call to ` #show: ifacconf-rules ` is necessary for some show rules defined in ` template.typ ` to get activated
  - ` ifac-conference.csl ` is a lightly modified version of ` apa.csl ` and is included in order to change the citation format from, e.g., ` (Able 1956) ` to ` Able (1956) ` in order to match ` ifacconf_latex `
  - Tables have formatting rules that get activated inside calls to ` figure ` with ` kind: "table" ` ; a convenience function ` tablefig ` is provided which sets this automatically
  - all theorem-like environments that were available in ` ifacconf_latex ` are defined in ` template.typ ` ; simply call, for example, ` #theorem[Content...] ... #proof[Proof...] `
  - the LaTeX version does not include a QED symbol at the end of proofs, however one is included here (this is easy to change)
  - Typst did not seem to like BibTeX citation keys containing colons (which was how they came from ` ifacconf_latex ` )
  - alignment for linebreaks in long equations is somewhat manual (e.g., for equation (2) in ` ifacconf.typ ` ) but probably there is a better way to handle this now or in the future
  - the files ` refs.bib ` (essentially) and ` bifurcation.jpg ` come from ` ifacconf_latex `
  - the file ` ifacconf.typ ` is modeled directly after ` ifacconf.tex ` by Juan a. de la Puente
  - the ` citep ` function renders citations like ` (Keohane, 1958) ` instead of the default style of ` Keohane (1958) `

= *minienvs.md*

=  minienvs

0.1.0

Theorem environments with minimal fuss

Theorem environments in [ Typst ](https://typst.app/) with minimal fuss.

To use, import and add a show rule:



    #import "@preview/minienvs:0.1.0": *
    #show: minienvs


You can optionally pass a custom configuration in the show-rule via `
minienvs.with(â¦) ` (see [ Customization
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/minienvs/0.1.0/#customization)
).

You can now just add a theorem along with its proof using the term list
syntax. For example:



    / Theorem (Ville's inequality):
      Let $X_0, ...$ be a non-negative supermartingale. Then, for any real number $a > 0$,

      $ PP[sup_(n>=0) X_n >= a] <= EE[X_0]/a. $

    Let us now prove it:

    / Proof:
      Consider the stopping time $N = inf {t >= 1 : X_t >= a}$.
      By the optional stopping theorem and the supermartingale convergence theorem, we have that

      $
        EE[X_0] >= EE[X_N]
        &= EE[X_N | N < oo] PP[N < oo] + EE[X_oo | N = oo] PP[N = oo] \
        &>= EE[X_N | N < oo] PP[N < oo]
        = EE[X_N/a | N < oo] a PP[N < oo]. \
      $

      And, therefore,

      $ PP[N < oo] <= EE[X_0] \/ a EE[X_N/a | N < oo] <= EE[X_0] \/ a. $


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/minienvs/0.1.0/assets/ville.png)

==  Labels and references

Currently, in order to label a minienv one needs to use the ` envlabel `
function. For example:



    / Lemma (Donsker and Varadhan's variational formula) #envlabel(<change-of-measure>):
      For any measureable, bounded function $h : Theta -> RR$ we have:

      $ log EE_(theta ~ pi)[exp h(theta)] = sup_(rho in cal(P)(Theta)) [ EE_(theta~rho)[h(theta)] - KL(rho || pi) ]. $

    As we will see, @change-of-measure is a fundamental building block of PAC-Bayes bounds.


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/minienvs/0.1.0/assets/donsker-
varadhan.png)

==  Customization

You can customize the appearance of minienvs by providing a configuration to
the show-rule. For example, for the default configuration, you can do:



    #show: minienvs.with(config: (
      // Whether to give numbers for environments.
      // If the environment is not mentioned in this dict, it has a number.
      no-numbering: (
        proof: true,
      ),
      // Additional options for the `block` containing the minienv (e.g., to put a box around the minienv).
      // If the environment is not mentioned in this dict, no additional options are passed.
      bbox: (:),
      // How to format the head of the minienv.
      // If the environment is not mentioned in this dict, then it is formatted in bold.
      head-style: (
        proof: it => [_#{it}_],
      ),
      // How to format the body of the minienv.
      // If the environment is not mentioned in this dict, then it is formatted in italic.
      transforms: (
        proof: it => [#it #h(1fr) $space qed$],
      )
    ))


==  Coming soon / Work in progress

  - Presets for multiple languages
  - Separate counters

template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/smooth-
tmlr-0.4.0-small.webp)

=  smooth-tmlr

0.4.0

Paper template for submission to Transaction on Machine Learning Research
(TMLR)

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=smooth-tmlr&version=0.4.0)

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking _Start from
template_ on the dashboard and searching for ` smooth-tmlr ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/smooth-tmlr


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Example Papers

Here are an example paper in [ LaTeX ](https://github.com/daskol/typst-
templates) and in [ Typst ](https://github.com/daskol/typst-
templates/#colored-annotations) .

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` tmlr ` function with the following named
arguments.

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` authors ` : An array of author dictionaries. Each of the author dictionaries must have a name key and can have the keys department, organization, location, and email.
  - ` keywords ` : Publication keywords (used in PDF metadata).
  - ` date ` : Creation date (used in PDF metadata).
  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or none. Appears at the top under the title.
  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the bibliography function or none. The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the paper.
  - ` appendix ` : Content to append after bibliography section.
  - ` accepted ` : If this is set to ` false ` then anonymized ready for submission document is produced; ` accepted: true ` produces camera-redy version. If the argument is set to ` none ` then preprint version is produced (can be uploaded to arXiv).
  - ` review ` : Hypertext link to review on OpenReview.
  - ` pubdate ` : Date of publication (used only month and date).

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` tmlr `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule at the top of your file.

==  Issues

This template is developed at [ daskol/typst-templates
](https://github.com/daskol/typst-templates) repo. Please report all issues
there.

  - While author instruction says the all text should be in sans serif font Computer Modern Bright, only headers and titles are in sans font Computer Modern Sans and the rest of text is causal Computer Modern Serif (or Roman). To be precice, the original template uses Latin Modern, a descendant of Computer Modern. In this tempalte we stick to CMU (Computer Modern Unicode) font family.

  - In the original template paper, the word *Abstract* is of large font size (12pt) and bold. This affects slightly line spacing. We donât know how to adjust Typst to reproduce this feature of the reference template but this issue does not impact a lot on visual appearence and layouting.

  - In the original template special level-3 sections like âAuthor Contributionsâ or âAcknowledgementsâ are not added to outline. We add them to outline as level-1 header but still render them as level-3 headers.

  - ICML-like bibliography style. In this case, the bibliography slightly differs from the one in the original example paper. The main difference is that we prefer to use authorâs lastname at first place to search an entry faster.

  - In the original template a lot of vertical space is inserted before and after graphics and table figures. It is unclear why so much space are inserted. We belive that the reason is how Typst justify content verticaly. Nevertheless, we append a page break after âDefault Notationâ section in order to show that spacing does not differ visually.

  - Another issue is related to Typstâs inablity to produce colored annotation. In order to mitigte the issue, we add a script which modifies annotations and make them colored.

        ../colorize-annotations.py \
        example-paper.typst.pdf example-paper-colored.typst.pdf

= *nth.md*

=  nth

1.0.1

Add english ordinals to numbers, eg. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.

Provides functions ` #nth() ` and ` #nths() ` which take a number and return
it suffixed by an english ordinal.

This package is named after the nth [ LaTeX macro ](https://ctan.org/pkg/nth)
by Donald Arseneau.

==  Usage

Include this line in your document to import the package.



    #import "@preview/nth:1.0.1": *


Then, you can use ` #nth() ` to markup ordinal numbers in your document.

For example, ` #nth(1) ` shows 1st,
` #nth(2) ` shows 2nd,
` #nth(3) ` shows 3rd,
` #nth(4) ` shows 4th,
and ` #nth(11) ` shows 11th.

If you want the ordinal to be in superscript, use ` #nths ` with an âsâ at
the end.

For example, ` #nths(1) ` shows 1  st  .

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` nth `

=  modernpro-cv

1.0.2

A CV template inspired by Deedy-Resume.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=modernpro-cv&version=1.0.2)

This Typst CV template is inspired by the Latex template [ Deedy-Resume
](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume) . You can use it for both industry
and academia.

If you want to find a cover letter template, you can check out [ modernpro-
coverletter ](https://github.com/jxpeng98/typst-coverletter) .

==  How to start

===  Use Typst CLI

If you use Typst CLI, you can use the following command to create a new
project:



    typst init modernpro-cv


It will create a folder named ` modernpro-cv ` with the following structure:



    modernpro-cv
    âââ bib.bib
    âââ cv_double.typ
    âââ cv_single.typ


If you want to use the single-column version, you can modify the template `
cv-single.typ ` . If you prefer the two-column version, you can use the ` cv-
double.typ ` .

*Note:* The ` bib.bib ` is the bibliography file. You can modify it to add
your publications.

===  Manual Download

If you want to manually download the template, you can download ` modernpro-
cv-{version}.zip ` from the [ release page
](https://github.com/jxpeng98/Typst-CV-Resume/releases)

===  Typst website

If you want to use the template via [ Typst ](https://typst.app/) , You can `
start from template ` and search for ` modernpro-cv ` .

==  How to use the template

===  The arguments

The template has the following arguments:

Argument  |  Description  |  Default
---|---|---
` font-type ` |  The font type. You can choose any supported font in your system.  |  ` Times New Roman `
` continue-header ` |  Whether to continue the header on the follwing pages.  |  ` false `
` name ` |  Your name.  |  ` "" `
` address ` |  Your address.  |  ` "" `
` lastupdated ` |  Whether to show the last updated date.  |  ` true `
` pagecount ` |  Whether to show the page count.  |  ` true `
` date ` |  The date of the CV.  |  ` today `
` contacts ` |  contact details, e.g phone number, email, etc.  |  ` (text: "", link: "") `

===  Start single column version

If you want to use the single column version, you create a new ` .typ ` file
and copy the following code:



    #import "@preview/modernpro-cv:1.0.2": *
    #import "@preview/fontawesome:0.5.0": *

    #show: cv-single.with(
      font-type: "PT Serif",
      continue-header: "false",
      name: [],
      address: [],
      lastupdated: "true",
      pagecount: "true",
      date: "2024-07-03",
      contacts: (
        (text: [#fa-icon("location-dot") UK]),
        (text: [#fa-icon("mobile") 123-456-789], link: "tel:123-456-789"),
        (text: [#fa-icon("link") example.com], link: "https://www.example.com"),
      )
    )


===  Start double column version

The double column version is similar to the single column version. However,
you need to add contents to the specific ` left ` and ` right ` sections.



    #import "@preview/modernpro-cv:1.0.2": *
    #import "@preview/fontawesome:0.5.0": *

    #show: cv-double(
      font-type: "PT Sans",
      continue-header: "true",
      name: [#lorem(2)],
      address: [#lorem(4)],
      lastupdated: "true",
      pagecount: "true",
      date: "2024-07-03",
      contacts: (
        (text: [#fa-icon("location-dot") UK]),
        (text: [#fa-icon("mobile") 123-456-789], link: "tel:123-456-789"),
        (text: [#fa-icon("link") example.com], link: "https://www.example.com"),
      ),
      left: [
        // contents for the left column
      ],
      right:[
        // contents for the right column
      ]
    )


===  Start the CV

Once you set up the arguments, you can start to add details to your CV /
Resume.

I preset the following functions for you to create different parts:

Function  |  Description
---|---
` #section("Section Name") ` |  Start a new section
` #sectionsep ` |  End the section
` #oneline-title-item(title: "", content: "") ` |  Add a one-line item ( *Title:* content)
` #oneline-two(entry1: "", entry2: "") ` |  Add a one-line item with two entries, aligned left and right
` #descript("descriptions") ` |  Add a description for self-introduction
` #award(award: "", date: "", institution: "") ` |  Add an award ( *award* , _institution_ _date_ )
` #education(institution: "", major: "", date: "", institution: "", core-modules: "") ` |  Add an education experience
` #job(position: "", institution: "", location: "", date: "", description: []) ` |  Add a job experience (description is optional)
` #twoline-item(entry1: "", entry2: "", entry3: "", entry4: "") ` |  Two line items, similar to education and job experiences
` #references(references:()) ` |  Add a reference list. In the ` () ` , you can add multi reference entries with the following format ` (name: "", position: "", department: "", institution: "", address: "", email: "",), `
` #show bibliography: none #bibliography("bib.bib") ` |  Add a bibliography. You can modify the ` bib.bib ` file to add your publications. *Note:* Keep this at the end of your CV

*Note:* Use ` + @ref ` to display your publications. For example,



    #section("Publications")

    // numbering list
    + @quenouille1949approximate
    + @quenouille1949approximate

    // Keep this at the end
    #show bibliography: none
    #bibliography("bib.bib")

*Note:* The legacy version also has a cover letter template. You can use it
with the CV template.

==  Cover Letter

provided a cover letter template.

template, you can find it from another repository [ typst-coverletter

= *stack-pointer.md*

=  stack-pointer

0.1.0

A library for visualizing the execution of (imperative) computer programs

Featured  Package

Stack Pointer is a library for visualizing the execution of (imperative)
computer programs, particularly in terms of effects on the call stack: stack
frames and local variables therein.

Stack Pointer lets you represent an example program (e.g. a C or Java program)
using typst code with minimal hassle, and get the execution state of that
program at different points in time. For example, the following C program



    int main() {
      int x = foo();
      return 0;
    }

    int foo() {
      return 0;
    }


would be represented by the following Typst code (see the [ manual
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/stack-
pointer/0.1.0/docs/manual.pdf) for a detailled explanation):



    #let steps = execute({
      let foo() = func("foo", 6, l => {
        l(0)
        l(1); retval(0)
      })
      let main() = func("main", 1, l => {
        l(0)
        l(1)
        let (x, ..rest) = foo(); rest
        l(1, push("x", x))
        l(2)
      })
      main(); l(none)
    })


The ` steps ` variable now contains an array, where each element corresponds
to one of the mentioned lines of code.

Take a look at [ this complete example
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/stack-
pointer/0.1.0/gallery/sum.pdf) of using Stack Pointer together with [ Polylux
](https://polylux.dev/book/) .

= *polytonoi.md*

=  polytonoi

0.1.0

Renders Roman letters into polytonic Greek.

A typst package for rendering text into polytonic Greek using a hopefully-
intuitive transliteration scheme.

==  Usage

First, be sure you include the package at the top of your typst file:



    @import "preview/polytonoi@0.1.0: *


The package currently exposes one function, ` #ptgk(<string>) ` , which will
convert ` <string> ` into polytonic Greek text in the same location where the
function appears in the typst document.

For example: ` #ptgk("polu/s") ` would render: ÏÎ¿Î»ÏÏ

*NOTE:* Quotation marks within the function call (see above example) are
*mandatory* , and the code will not work without them.

Where possible, Greek letters have been linked with their closest Roman
equivalent (e.g. a --> Î±, b --> Î²). Where not possible, Iâve tried to
stick to common convention, such as what is used by the Perseus Project for
their transliteration. A couple letters (Î¾ and Ï) are made up of two letters
( ` ks ` and ` ps ` respectively), which the ` #ptgk() ` function handles as
special cases. See below for the full transliteration scheme.

====  Additional Usage Notes

  1. Any character that isnât specifically accounted for (including white space, most punctuation, numbers, etc.) is rendered as-is.
  2. Smooth breathing marks are automatically added to a vowel that begins a word, unless that first vowel is followed by another. In this case, youâll need to manually add it to the second vowel.

===  Text Formatting

As of now, the text is processed as a string, which means that any formatting
markup (such as ` _ ` or ` * ` ) is *not* included in how the text is
rendered, and is instead passed through and will display literally. To apply
any kind of formatting to the Greek text, the markup or commands must be put
outside the text passed to the function. Compare the following two examples to
see how this works:

` #ptgk("_Arxh\_") ` would display as _á¼ÏÏá½´_

whereas

` _#ptgk("Arxh\")_ ` would display as _á¼ÏÏá½´_

==  Transliteration Scheme

Roman letter  |  Greek result  |  Notes
---|---|---
a  |  Î±  |
b  |  Î²  |
g  |  Î³  |
d  |  Î´  |
e  |  Îµ  |
z  |  Î¶  |
h  |  Î·  |
q  |  Î¸  |
i  |  Î¹  |
k  |  Îº  |
l  |  Î»  |
m  |  Î¼  |
n  |  Î½  |
ks  |  Î¾  |
o  |  Î¿  |
p  |  Ï  |
r  |  Ï  |
s  |  Ï/Ï  |  Renders as final sigma automatically
t  |  Ï  |
u  |  Ï  |
v  |  Ï  |
x  |  Ï  |
ps  |  Ï  |
w  |  Ï  |

Upper-case letters are handled the same way, just with an upper-case letter as
input. The upper-case versions of the two âcombinedâ letters (Î and Î¨)
can be entered either as âKSâ/âPSâ or âKsâ/âPsâ.

===  Accents & Breathing Marks

As mentioned above, this package will automatically put a smooth breathing
mark on a vowel that begins a word, unless that vowel is followed immediately
by a second vowel. In that instance, youâll have to manually put the smooth
breathing mark in its correct place. (This is to avoid having to code for edge
cases, such as where a word starts with three vowels in a row.) By the same
token, rough breathing must always be entered manually.

Input  |  Greek  |  Notes  |  Example
---|---|---|---
(  |  rough breathing  |  Put before the vowel  |  ` (a ` \--> á¼
)  |  smooth breathing  |  Put before the vowel  |  ` )a ` \--> á¼
\  |  Grave / varia  |  Put after the vowel  |  ` a\ ` \--> á½°
/  |  Acute / oxia / tonos  |  Put after the vowel  |  ` a/ ` \--> Î¬
=  |  Tilde / perispomeni  |  Put after the vowel  |  ` a= ` \--> á¾¶
|  |  Iota subscript  |  Put after the vowel  |  ` a| ` \--> á¾³
:  |  Diaresis  |  Put after the vowel  |  ` i: ` \--> Ï

Multiple diacriticals can be added to a vowel, e.g. ` (h| ` \--> á¾

===  Punctuation

Most Roman punctuation characters are left unchanged. The exceptions are ` ; `
(semicolon) and ` ? ` (question mark), which are rendered as a high dot (Î)
and the Greek question mark (Í¾) respectively.

==  Feedback

Feedback is welcome, and please donât hesitate to open an issue if something
doesnât work. Iâve tried to account for edge cases, but I certainly
canât guarantee that Iâve found everything.

=  glossarium

0.5.1

Glossarium is a simple, easily customizable typst glossary.

Featured  Package

> [!TIP] Glossarium is based in great part of the work of [ SÃ©bastien
> dâHerbais de Thun ](https://github.com/Dherse) from his master thesis
> available at: [ https://github.com/Dherse/masterproef
> ](https://github.com/Dherse/masterproef) . His glossary is available under
> the MIT license [ here
> ](https://github.com/Dherse/masterproef/blob/main/elems/acronyms.typ) .

Glossarium is a simple, easily customizable typst glossary inspired by [ LaTeX
glossaries package ](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/glossaries) . You can see
various examples showcasing the different features in the ` examples ` folder.

![Screenshot](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/glossarium/0.5.1/.github/example.png)

==  Manual

==  Fast start



    #import "@preview/glossarium:0.5.1": make-glossary, register-glossary, print-glossary, gls, glspl
    #show: make-glossary
    #let entry-list = (
      (
        key: "kuleuven",
        short: "KU Leuven",
        long: "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven",
        description: "A university in Belgium.",
      ),
      // Add more terms
    )
    #register-glossary(entry-list)
    // Your document body
    #print-glossary(
     entry-list
    )


===  Import and setup

This manual assume you have a good enough understanding of typst markup and
scripting.

For Typst 0.6.0 or later import the package from the typst preview repository:



    #import "@preview/glossarium:0.5.1": make-glossary, register-glossary, print-glossary, gls, glspl


For Typst before 0.6.0 or to use *glossarium* as a local module, download
the package files into your project folder and import ` glossarium.typ ` :



    #import "glossarium.typ": make-glossary, register-glossary, print-glossary, gls, glspl


After importing the package and before making any calls to ` gls ` , ` print-
glossary ` or ` glspl ` , please _*MAKE SURE* _ you add this line



    #show: make-glossary


> _WHY DO WE NEED THAT ?_ : In order to be able to create references to the
> terms in your glossary using typst ref syntax ` @key ` glossarium needs to
> setup some [ show rules ](https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/advanced-styling/)
> before any references exist. This is due to the way typst works, there is no
> workaround.
>
> Therefore I recommend that you always put the ` #show: ... ` statement on
> the line just below the ` #import ` statement.

===  Registering the glossary

First we have to define the terms. A term is a [ dictionary
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/types/dictionary/) as follows:

Key  |  Type  |  Required/Optional  |  Description
---|---|---|---
` key ` |  string  |  required  |  Case-sensitive, unique identifier used to reference the term.
` short ` |  string  |  semi-optional  |  The short form of the term replacing the term citation.
` long ` |  string or content  |  semi-optional  |  The long form of the term, displayed in the glossary and on the first citation of the term.
` description ` |  string or content  |  optional  |  The description of the term.
` plural ` |  string or content  |  optional  |  The pluralized short form of the term.
` longplural ` |  string or content  |  optional  |  The pluralized long form of the term.
` group ` |  string  |  optional  |  Case-sensitive group the term belongs to. The terms are displayed by groups in the glossary.


    #let entry-list = (
      // minimal term
      (
        key: "kuleuven",
        short: "KU Leuven"
      ),
      // a term with a long form and a group
      (
        key: "unamur",
        short: "UNamur",
        long: "Namur University",
        group: "Universities"
      ),
      // a term with a markup description
      (
        key: "oidc",
        short: "OIDC",
        long: "OpenID Connect",
        description: [
          OpenID is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol promoted by the non-profit
          #link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Foundation")[OpenID Foundation].
        ],
        group: "Acronyms",
      ),
      // a term with a short plural
      (
        key: "potato",
        short: "potato",
        // "plural" will be used when "short" should be pluralized
        plural: "potatoes",
        description: [#lorem(10)],
      ),
      // a term with a long plural
      (
        key: "dm",
        short: "DM",
        long: "diagonal matrix",
        // "longplural" will be used when "long" should be pluralized
        longplural: "diagonal matrices",
        description: "Probably some math stuff idk",
      ),
    )


Then the terms are passed as a list to ` register-glossary `



    #register-glossary(entry-list)


===  Printing the glossary

Now, you can display the glossary using the ` print-glossary ` function.



    #print-glossary(entry-list)


By default, the terms that are not referenced in the document are not shown in
the glossary, you can force their appearance by setting the ` show-all `
argument to true.

You can also disable the back-references by setting the parameter ` disable-
back-references ` to ` true ` .

By default, group breaks use ` linebreaks ` . This behaviour can be changed by
setting the ` user-group-break ` parameter to ` pagebreak() ` , or `
colbreak() ` , or any other function that returns the ` content ` you want.

You can call this function from anywhere in your document.

===  Referencing terms.

Referencing terms is done using the key of the terms using the ` gls `
function or the reference syntax.



    // referencing the OIDC term using gls
    #gls("oidc")
    // displaying the long form forcibly
    #gls("oidc", long: true)

    // referencing the OIDC term using the reference syntax
    @oidc


====  Handling plurals

You can use the ` glspl ` function and the references supplements to pluralize
terms. The ` plural ` key will be used when ` short ` should be pluralized and
` longplural ` will be used when ` long ` should be pluralized. If the `
plural ` key is missing then glossarium will add an âsâ at the end of the
short form as a fallback.



    #glspl("potato")


Please look at the examples regarding plurals.

====  Overriding the text shown

You can also override the text displayed by setting the ` display ` argument.



    #gls("oidc", display: "whatever you want")


==  Final tips

I recommend setting a show rule for the links to that your readers understand
that they can click on the references to go to the term in the glossary.



    #show link: set text(fill: blue.darken(60%))
    // links are now blue !


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` glossarium `



    #import "@preview/glossarium:0.5.1"

=  quick-maths

0.2.0

Custom shorthands for math equations.

Featured  Package

A package for creating custom shorthands for math equations.

==  Usage

The package comes with a single template function ` shorthands ` that takes
one or more tuples of the form ` (shorthand, replacement) ` , where `
shorthand ` can be a string or content.

There are some small quality of life features for interaction of shorthands
with fractions and attachments:

  - If the right-most symbol of a shorthand has any attachments, they are moved to the shorthandâs replacement.
  - If a shorthand ends in the numerator of a fraction, the whole replacement is placed in the numerator.
  - If a shorthand starts in the denominator of a fraction, the whole replacement is placed in the denominator.

As the implementation of these features is quite hacky, you may encounter some
edge cases, where the use of explicit parentheses hopefully saves you.

==  Notes

  - Shorthands are parsed in the order they are given, so if you have a shorthand that is a prefix of another shorthand, you should put the longer shorthand first.

  - The content of an equation is traversed from left to right, so the left-most matching shorthand will be replaced first.

  - Shorthands consisting of only a single character or element may be applied using show rules, so that they can affect non-sequence elements. This may lead to different behavior than multi-character shorthands.

  - If the replacement of a shorthand contains a shorthand itself, there are no protections against infinite recursion or overflows.

==  Example



    #import "@preview/quick-maths:0.2.0": shorthands

    #show: shorthands.with(
      ($+-$, $plus.minus$),
      ($|-$, math.tack),
      ($<=$, math.arrow.l.double) // Replaces 'â¤'
    )

    $ x^2 = 9 quad <==> quad x = +-3 $
    $ A or B |- A $
    $ x <= y $

=  wonderous-book

0.1.1

A fiction book template with running headers and serif typography

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=wonderous-book&version=0.1.1)

A book template for fiction. The template contains a title page, a table of
contents, and a chapter template.

Dynamic running headers contain the title of the chapter and the book.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` wonderous-book ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/wonderous-book


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` book ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` title ` : The bookâs title as content.
  - ` author ` : Content or an array of content to specify the author.
  - ` paper-size ` : Defaults to ` iso-b5 ` . Specify a [ paper size string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-paper) to change the page format.
  - ` dedication ` : Who or what this book is dedicated to as content or ` none ` . Will appear on its own page.
  - ` publishing-info ` : Details for the front matter of this book as content or ` none ` .

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
book.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` book `
function in a show rule. If you, however, want to change an existing project
to use this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your
file:



    #import "@preview/wonderous-book:0.1.1": book

    #show: book.with(
      title: [Liam's Playlist],
      author: "Janet Doe",
      dedication: [for Rachel],

=  efilrst

0.3.0

A simple referenceable list library for typst.

A simple referenceable list library for Typst. If you ever wanted to reference
elements in a list by a key, this library is for you. The name comes from
âreflistâ but sorted alphabetically because we are not allowed to use
descriptive names for packages in Typst ð¤·ð»ââï¸.

==  Example



    #import "@preview/efilrst:0.1.0" as efilrst
    #show ref: efilrst.show-rule

    #let constraint = efilrst.reflist.with(
      name: "Constraint",
      list-style: "C1.1.1)",
      ref-style: "C1.1.1")

    #constraint(
      counter-name: "continuable",
      [My cool constraint A],<c:a>,
      [My also cool constraint B],<c:b>,
      [My non-referenceable constraint C],
    )

    See how my @c:a is better than @c:b but not as cool as @c:e.

    #constraint(
      counter-name: "continuable",
      [We continue the list with D],<c:d>,
      [And then add constraint E],<c:e>,
    )

    #constraint(
      [This is a new list!],<c:f>,
      (
        [And it has a sublist!],<c:g>,
        [With a constraint H],<c:h>,
      )
    )

    #constraint(
      [This is another list!],<c:i>,
    )


This generates the following output:

![Example of the typst output. The last sentence reads "See how my Constraint
C1 is better than Constraint
C2"](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/efilrst/0.3.0/img/image.png)

0.1.1

Wrap text around figures and content

Featured  Package

Until __[ https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/553
](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/553) _ _ is resolved, ` typst `
doesnât natively support wrapping text around figures or other content.
However, you can use ` wrap-it ` to mimic much of this functionality:

  - Wrapping images left or right of their text

  - Specifying margins

  - And more

Detailed descriptions of each parameter are available in the __[ wrap-it
documentation ](https://github.com/ntjess/wrap-it/blob/main/docs/manual.pdf) _
_ .

The easiest method is to import ` wrap-it: wrap-content ` from the ` @preview
` package:



    #import "@preview/wrap-it:0.1.0": wrap-content


==  Vanilla



    #let fig = figure(
    rect(fill: teal, radius: 0.5em, width: 8em),
    caption: [A figure],
    )
    #let body = lorem(30)
    #wrap-content(fig, body)


![Example 1](https://www.github.com/ntjess/wrap-
it/raw/v0.1.1/assets/example-1.png)

==  Changing alignment and margin



    #wrap-content(
    fig,
    body,
    align: bottom + right,
    column-gutter: 2em
    )


![Example 2](https://www.github.com/ntjess/wrap-
it/raw/v0.1.1/assets/example-2.png)

==  Uniform margin around the image

The easiest way to get a uniform, highly-customizable margin is through boxing
your image:



    #let boxed = box(fig, inset: 0.25em)
    #wrap-content(boxed)[
    #lorem(30)
    ]


![Example 3](https://www.github.com/ntjess/wrap-
it/raw/v0.1.1/assets/example-3.png)

==  Wrapping two images in the same paragraph

Note that for longer captions (as is the case in the bottom figure below),
providing an explicit ` columns ` parameter is necessary to inform caption
text of where to wrap.



    #let fig2 = figure(
    rect(fill: lime, radius: 0.5em),
    caption: [#lorem(10)],
    )
    #wrap-top-bottom(
    bottom-kwargs: (columns: (1fr, 2fr)),
    box(fig, inset: 0.25em),
    fig2,
    lorem(50),
    )


![Example 4](https://www.github.com/ntjess/wrap-
it/raw/v0.1.1/assets/example-4.png)

==  Adding a label to a wrapped figure

Typst can only append labels to figures in content mode. So, when wrapping
text around a figure that needs a label, you must first place your figure in a
content block with its label, then wrap it:



    #show ref: it => underline(text(blue, it))
    #let fig = [
      #figure(
        rect(fill: red, radius: 0.5em, width: 8em),
        caption:[Labeled]
      )<fig:lbl>
    ]
    #wrap-content(fig, [Fortunately, @fig:lbl's label can be referenced within the wrapped text. #lorem(15)])


![Example 5](https://www.github.com/ntjess/wrap-
it/raw/v0.1.1/assets/example-5.png)

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` wrap-it `



    #import "@preview/wrap-it:0.1.1"

=  game-theoryst

0.1.0

A package for typesetting games in Typst.

Featured  Package

A package for typesetting games in Typst.

Full manual available [ here
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/game-
theoryst/0.1.0/doc/gtheoryst-manual.pdf)

Work in progress â _coming soon!_

==  Overview

====  Simple Example

The main function to make strategic (or *normal* ) form games is ` nfg ` .
For a basic 2x2 game, you can do



    #nfg(
      players: ("Jack", "Diane"),
      s1: ($C$, $D$),
      s2: ($C$, $D$),
      [$10, 10$], [$2, 20$],
      [$20, 2$], [$5, 5$],
    )


![Basic
Example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/game-
theoryst/0.1.0/doc/gallery/simple-example.png)

===  Importing

Simply insert the following into your Typst code:



    #import "@preview/game-theoryst:0.1.0": *


This imports the ` nfg() ` function as well as the underlining methods. If you
want to tweak the helper functions for generating an ` nfg ` , import them
explicitly through the ` utils/ ` directory.

====  Full Example



    #nfg(
      players: ([A\ Joe], [Bas Pro]),
      s1: ([$x$], [a]),
      s2: ("x", "aaaa", [$a$]),
      pad: ("x": 12pt, "y": 10pt),
      eliminations: ("s11", "s21", "s22"),
      ejust: (
        s11: (x: (0pt, 36pt), y: (-3pt, -3.5pt)),
        s22: (x: (-10pt, -12pt), y: (-10pt, 10pt)),
        s21: (x: (-3pt, -9pt), y: (-10pt, 10pt)),
      ),
      mixings: (hmix: ($p$, $1-p$), vmix: ($q$, $r$, $1-q-r$)),
      custom-fills: (hp: maroon, vp: navy, hm: purple, vm: fuchsia, he: gray, ve: gray),
      [$0,vul(100000000)$], [$0,1$], [$0,0$],
      [$hul(1),1$], [$0, -1$], table.cell(fill: yellow.lighten(30%), [$hful(0),vful(0)$])
    )


![Full
Example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/game-
theoryst/0.1.0/doc/gallery/full-example.png)

===  Color

By default, player names, mixed-strategy parameters (called _mixings_ ), and
elimination lines are shown in color. These colors can be turned off at the
method-level by passing ` bw: true ` , or at the document level by running the
state helper-function ` #colorless() ` .

` nfg ` accepts custom colors for all of the aforementioned parameters by
passing a ` dictionary ` of colors to the ` custom-fills ` arg. The keys for
this dictionary are as follows ( ` <defaults> ` ):

  - ` hp ` â âhorizontal playerâ (red)
  - ` vp ` â âvertical playerâ (blue)
  - ` hm ` â âhor. mixingâ (#e64173)
  - ` vm ` â âver. mixingâ (eastern)
  - ` he ` â âhor. eliminationâ line (orange)
  - ` ve ` â âver. eliminationâ line (olive)

==  Cell Customization

Since the payoffs are implemented as argument sinks ( ` ..args ` ) which are
passed directly to Typstâs ` #table() ` , underlining of non-math can be
accomplished via the standard ` #underline() ` command. Similarly, any of the
payoff cells can be customized by using ` table.cell() ` directly. For
instance, ` table.cell(fill: yellow.lighten(30%), [$1, 1$]) ` can be used to
highlight a specific cell.

===  Padding

There are edge cases where the default padding may be off. These can be mended
by passing the optional ` pad ` argument to ` nfg() ` . This should represent
how much *_additional_ * padding you want. The ` pad ` arg. is interpreted
as follows:

  - If a ` length ` is provided, it assumes you want that much length added to all cell walls
  - If an array of the form ` (L1, L2) ` is provided, it assumes you want padding a horizontal ( ` x ` ) padding of ` L1 ` and a vertical padding ( ` y ` ) of ` L2 `
  - If a ` dictionary ` is provided, it operates identically to that of the array, but you must specify the ` x ` / ` y ` keys yourself

===  AUtomatic Cell Sizing

Cell are automatically sized to equal heights/widths according to the
longest/tallest content. If you want to avoid this behavior, pass ` lazy-
cells: true ` to ` nfg ` . This behavior can be combined with the custom `
padding ` argument.

==  Semantic Game Theory Features

===  Underlining

The package imports a small set of underlining utility functions.

The primary functions for underlining are

  - ` hul() ` â _Horizontal Underline_
  - ` vul() ` â _Vertical Underline_
  - ` bul() ` â _Black Underline_ These can be wrapped around values in math-mode ( ` $..$ ` ) within the payoff matrix. The underlines for ` hul ` and ` vul ` are colored by default according to the default colors for names, but they accept an optional ` col ` parameter for changing the color of the underline. ` bul() ` produces a black underline.



    #nfg(
      players: ("Jack", "Diane"),
      s2: ($x$, $y$, $z$),
      s1: ($a$, $b$),
      [$hul(0),vul(0)$], [$1,1$], [$2,2$],
      [$3,3$], [$4,4$], [$5,5$],
    )


By default, these commands leave the numbers themselves black, but boldfaces
them. _Full Color_ versions of ` hul ` and ` vul ` , which color the numbers
and under-lines identically, are available via ` hful() ` and ` vful() ` .
Like their counterparts, they accept an optional ` col ` command for the
color.

Both of the colors can be modified individually via the general ` cul() `
command, which takes in content ( ` cont ` ), an underline color ( ` ucol ` ),
and the color for the text value ( ` tcol ` ). For instance,



    #let new-ul(cont, col: olive, tcol: fuchsia) = { cul(cont, col, tcol) }


will define a new command which underlines in olive and sets the text (math)
color to fuchsia.

===  Mixed Strategies

You can optionally mark mixed strategies that a player will in a ` nfg ` using
the ` mixing ` argument. This can be a ` dictionary ` with ` hmix ` and ` vmix
` keys, or an ` array ` , interpreted as a dictionary with the aforementioned
keys in the ` (hmix, vmix) ` order. The values/entries here should be arrays
which mimic ` s1 ` and ` s2 ` in size, with some parameter denoting the
proportion of time the relevant player uses that strategy. If you would like
to omit a strategy from this markup, pass ` [] ` in itâs place.

For example:



    #nfg(

===  Iterated Deletion (Elimination) of Dominated Strategies

You can use the ` pinit ` package to cross out lines, semantically eliminating
strategies. ` pinit ` comes pre-imported with ` game-theoryst ` by default.

You can tell ` nfg ` which strategies to eliminate with the ` eliminations `
argument and the corresponding ` ejust ` helper-argument. The ` eliminations `
argument is simply an ` array ` of ` strings ` of the form ` "s<i><j>" ` ,
where ` <i> ` is the player â 1 or 2 â and ` <j> ` is player ` i ` âs `
<j> ` th strategy, in left-to-right / top-to-bottom order _starting at 1_ .
These strategy strings represent the rows/columns which you want to eliminate.
For instance, ` ("s12", "s21") ` denotes an elimination of player 1âs second
strategy as well as player 2âs first strategy.

Due to ` context ` dependence, the lines typically need manual adjustments,
which can be done via the ` ejust ` arg. ` ejust ` needs to be a dictionary
with keys of matching those strings present in ` eliminations ` ( ` s11 ` , `
s21 ` , etc.). The values of one of these dictionary entries is itself a
dictionary: one with ` x ` and ` y ` keys. Each of these keys needs an array
consisting of 2 lengths, corresponding to the starting/ending ` dx/dy `
adjustments from ` pinit-line ` .

For example, one such ` ejust ` argument could be ` ("s12": (x: (5pt, -5pt),
y: (-10pt, 3pt))) ` . This says to adjust the âs12â elimination line by `
5pt ` in the x direction and ` -10pt ` in the y direction for the starting
(strategy-) side of the line, and adjust by ` -5pt ` in x and ` 3pt ` in y on
the ending (payoff-) side of the line.



    #let just-arr = (
        "s12": (x: (0pt, 10pt), y: (-3pt, -3pt)),
        "s13": (x: (0pt, 10pt), y: (-3pt, -3pt)),
        "s14": (x: (0pt, 10pt), y: (-3pt, -3pt)),
        "s21": (x: (-6pt, -8pt), y: (3pt, 8pt)),
        "s22": (x: (-4pt, -8pt), y: (3pt, 8pt)),
        "s23": (x: (-4pt, -8pt), y: (3pt, 8pt)),
    )

    #nfg(
      players: ("A", "B"),
      s1: ([$N$], [$S$], [$E$], [$W$] ),
      s2: ([$W$], [$E$], [$F$], [$A$]),
      eliminations: ("s12", "s13", "s14", "s21", "s22", "s23"),
      ejust: just-arr,
      [$6,4$], [$7,3$], [$5,5$], [$6,6$],
      [$7,3$], [$2,7$], [$4,6$], [$5,5$],
      [$8,2$], [$6,4$], [$3,7$], [$2,8$],
      [$3,7$], [$5,5$], [$4,6$], [$5,5$],
    )

===  Debugging

If you want to see all of the lines for the table, including the ones for a
players, strategies, and mixings, set the following at the top of your
document.



    #set table.cell(stroke: (thickness: auto))


Note that cells are always present for mixings, they just have 0 width/height
when no mixings of a specific variety are provided.

0.2.0

Write Tengwar easily with Typst.

A simple module to write [ tengwar ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengwar) in
[ Typst ](https://typst.app/) .

==  Requirements

  - [ Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) version 0.11.0 or 0.11.1
  - The [ Tengwar Annatar ](https://www.fontspace.com/tengwar-annatar-font-f2244) fonts version 1.20

To use this module with the [ Typst web app ](https://typst.app/) , you need
to upload the font files to your project.

==  Usage

The main functionality of this module is provided by functions taking content
and converting all text in Tenwar:

  - ` quenya ` converts text using the mode of Quenya,
  - ` gondor ` converts text using the Sindarin mode of Gondor.

The original text is used as a phonetic transcription. (This module does not
translate English into Quenya or Sindarin.) See the [ manual
](https://github.com/FlorentCLMichel/quetta/blob/main/manual.pdf) for more
information.

The following line may be used to convert the whole document below to Tengwar
in Quenya mode (other ` show ` rules might interfere with it):



    #show: quetta.quenya


*Example:*



    #import "@preview/quetta:0.2.0"

    // Use the function `quenya` to write a small amount of text in Tengwar (Quenya mode)
    #text(size: 16pt,
          fill: gradient.linear(blue, green)
         )[#box(quetta.quenya[_tengwar_])]

    #v(1em)

    // A `show` rule may be more convenient for larger contents; beware that it may interfere with other ones, though
    #show: quetta.quenya

    NamÃ¡riÃ«!

    #h(1em) _NamÃ¡riÃ«!_

    #h(2em) _NamÃ¡riÃ«!_


==  Roadmap

  - Number conversion: done
  - Support for the Quenya mode: done
  - Support for the mode of Gondor: done
  - Support for the mode of Beleriand: backlog
  - Support for the Black Speech: backlog

==  Changelog

===  v0.2.0

  - Add support for SindarinâMode of Gondor
  - *Breaking change:* The symbol used to prevent combination was changed from ` : ` to ` | ` .
  - Small changes to the kerning between several tengwar and to tehtar positions.

===  v0.1.0

Initial release with Quenya support.

==  How can I contribute?

I (the original author) am definitely not en expert in either Typst nor
Tengwar. I could thus use some help in all areas. I would especially welcome
contributions or suggestions on the following:

  - Identify and resolve inefficiencies in the Typst code.
  - Identify cases where the result differs from the expected one. (In particular, there are probably rules for writing in Tengwar that I either am not aware of or have not properly understood. Any advice on that is warmly welcome!)
  - References on Tengar, Quenya, and Sindarin.
  - Support for other Tengwar fonts.

==  Introduction

Proper number formatting requires some love for detail to guarantee a readable
and clear output. This package provides tools to ensure consistent formatting
and to simplify the process of following established publication practices.
Key features are

  - *standardized* formatting,
  - digit [ *grouping* ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/zero/0.3.0/#grouping) , e.g., 299â¯792â¯458 instead of 299792458,
  - *plug-and-play* number [ *alignment in tables* ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/zero/0.3.0/#table-alignment) ,
  - quick scientific notation, e.g., ` "2e4" ` becomes 2Ã10â´,
  - symmetric and asymmetric [ *uncertainties* ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/zero/0.3.0/#specifying-uncertainties) ,
  - [ *rounding* ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/zero/0.3.0/#rounding) in various modes,
  - and some specials for package authors.

A number in scientific notation consists of three parts of which the latter
two are optional. The first part is the _mantissa_ that may consist of an
_integer_ and a _fractional_ part. In many fields of science, values are not
known exactly and the corresponding _uncertainty_ is then given along with the
mantissa. Lastly, to facilitate reading very large or small numbers, the
mantissa may be multiplied with a _power_ of 10 (or another base).

The anatomy of a formatted number is shown in the following figure.

===  ` num `

The function ` num() ` is the heart of _Zero_ . It provides a wide range of
number formatting utilities and its default values are configurable via ` set-
num() ` which takes the same named arguments as ` num() ` .



    #let num(
      number:                 str |âcontent | int | float | dictionary | array,
      digits:                 auto |âint = auto,
      fixed:                  none | int = none,

      decimal-separator:      str = ".",
      product:                content = sym.times,
      tight:                  boolean = false,
      math:                   boolean = true,
      omit-unity-mantissa:    boolean = true,
      positive-sign:          boolean = false,
      positive-sign-exponent: boolean = false,
      base:                   int | content = 10,
      uncertainty-mode:       str = "separate",
      round:                  dictionary,
      group:                  dictionary,
    )


  - ` number: str |âcontent | int | float | array ` : Number input; ` str ` is preferred. If the input is ` content ` , it may only contain text nodes. Numeric types ` int ` and ` float ` are supported but not encouraged because of information loss (e.g., the number of trailing â0â digits or the exponent). The remaining types ` dictionary ` and ` array ` are intended for advanced use, see [ below ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/zero/0.3.0/#zero-for-third-party-packages) .
  - ` digits: auto |âint = auto ` : Truncates the number at a given (positive) number of decimal places or pads the number with zeros if necessary. This is independent of [ rounding ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/zero/0.3.0/#rounding) .
  - ` fixed: none | int = none ` : If not ` none ` , forces a fixed exponent. Additional exponents given in the number input are taken into account.
  - ` decimal-separator: str = "." ` : Specifies the marker that is used for separating integer and decimal part.
  - ` product: content = sym.times ` : Specifies the multiplication symbol used for scientific notation.
  - ` tight: boolean = false ` : If true, tight spacing is applied between operands (applies to Ã and Â±).
  - ` math: boolean = true ` : If set to ` false ` , the parts of the number wonât be wrapped in a ` math.equation ` wherever feasible. This makes it possible to use ` num() ` with non-math fonts to some extent. Powers are always rendered in math mode.
  - ` omit-unity-mantissa: boolean = false ` : Determines whether a mantissa of 1 is omitted in scientific notation, e.g., 10â´ instead of 1Â·10â´.
  - ` positive-sign: boolean = false ` : If set to ` true ` , positive coefficients are shown with a + sign.
  - ` positive-sign-exponent: boolean = false ` : If set to ` true ` , positive exponents are shown with a + sign.
  - ` base: int | content = 10 ` : The base used for scientific power notation.
  - ` uncertainty-mode: str = "separate" ` : Selects one of the modes ` "separate" ` , ` "compact" ` , or ` "compact-separator" ` for displaying uncertainties. The different behaviors are shown below:

` "separate" ` |  ` "compact" ` |  ` "compact-separator" `
---|---|---
1.7Â±0.2  |  1.7(2)  |  1.7(2)
6.2Â±2.1  |  6.2(21)  |  6.2(2.1)
1.7âºâ°ËÌÂ²ââ.â  |  1.7âºÂ²ââ  |  1.7âºÂ²ââ
1.7âºÂ²ËÌâ°ââ .â  |  1.7âºÂ²â°ââ â  |  1.7âºÂ²ËÌâ°ââ .â

  - ` round: dictionary ` : You can provide one or more rounding options in a dictionary. Also see [ rounding ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/zero/0.3.0/#rounding) .
  - ` group: dictionary ` : You can provide one or more grouping options in a dictionary. Also see [ grouping ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/zero/0.3.0/#grouping) .

Configuration example:



    #set-num(product: math.dot, tight: true)


===  Grouping

Digit grouping is important for keeping large figures readable. It is
customary to separate thousands with a thin space, a period, comma, or an
apostrophe (however, we discourage using a period or a comma to avoid
confusion since both are used for decimal separators in various countries).

![Digit grouping](https://github.com/user-
attachments/assets/1f53ae33-3e99-483d-ac6a-6e3cbed5484b)

Digit grouping can be configured with the ` set-group() ` function.



    #let set-group(
      size:       int = 3,
      separator:  content = sym.space.thin,
      threshold:  int = 5
    )


  - ` size: int = 3 ` : Determines the size of the groups.
  - ` separator: content = sym.space.thin ` : Separator between groups.
  - ` threshold: int = 5 ` : Necessary number of digits needed for digit grouping to kick in. Four-digit numbers for example are usually not grouped at all since they can still be read easily.

Configuration example:



    #set-group(separator: "'", threshold: 4)


Grouping can be turned off altogether by setting the ` threshold ` to `
calc.inf ` .

===  Rounding

Rounding can be configured with the ` set-round() ` function.



    #let set-round(
      mode:       none |âstr = none,
      precision:  int = 2,
      pad:        boolean = true,
      direction:  str = "nearest",
    )


  - ` mode: none |âstr = none ` : Sets the rounding mode. The possible options are
    - ` none ` : Rounding is turned off.
    - ` "places" ` : The number is rounded to the number of decimal places given by the ` precision ` parameter.
    - ` "figures" ` : The number is rounded to a number of significant figures given by the ` precision ` parameter.
    - ` "uncertainty" ` : Requires giving an uncertainty value. The uncertainty is rounded to significant figures according to the ` precision ` argument and then the number is rounded to the same number of decimal places as the uncertainty.
  - ` precision: int = 2 ` : The precision to round to. Also see parameter ` mode ` .
  - ` pad: boolean = true ` : Whether to pad the number with zeros if the number has fewer digits than the rounding precision.
  - ` direction: str = "nearest" ` : Sets the rounding direction.
    - ` "nearest" ` : Rounding takes place in the usual fashion, rounding to the nearer number, e.g., 2.34 â 2.3 and 2.36 â 2.4.
    - ` "down" ` : Always rounds down, e.g., 2.38 â 2.3 and 2.30 â 2.3.
    - ` "up" ` : Always rounds up, e.g., 2.32 â 2.4 and 2.30 â 2.3.

===  Specifying uncertainties

There are two ways of specifying uncertainties:

  - Applying an uncertainty to the least significant digits using parentheses, e.g., ` 2.3(4) ` ,
  - Denoting an absolute uncertainty, e.g., ` 2.3+-0.4 ` becomes 2.3Â±0.4.

Zero supports both and can convert between these two, so that you can pick the
displayed style (configured via ` uncertainty-mode ` , see above)
independently of the input style.

How do uncertainties interplay with exponents? The uncertainty needs to come
first, and the exponent applies to both the mantissa and the uncertainty,
e.g., ` num("1.23+-.04e2") ` becomes

(1.23â¯Â±â¯0.03)Ã10Â²

Note that the mantissa is now put in parentheses to disambiguate the
application of the power.

In some cases, the uncertainty is asymmetric which can be expressed via `
num("1.23+0.02-0.01") `

1.23âºâ°ËÌâ°Â²ââ.ââ

===  Table alignment

In scientific publication, presenting many numbers in a readable fashion can
be a difficult discipline. A good starting point is to align numbers in a
table at the decimal separator. With _Zero_ , this can be accomplished by
using ` ztable ` , a wrapper for the built-in ` table ` function. It features
an additional parameter ` format ` which takes an array of ` none ` , ` auto `
, or ` dictionary ` values to turn on number alignment for specific columns.



    #ztable(
      columns: 3,
      align: center,
      format: (none, auto, auto),
      $n$, $Î±$, $Î²$,
      [1], [3.45], [-11.1],
      ..
    )


Non-number entries (e.g., in the header) are automatically recognized in some
cases and will not be aligned. In ambiguous cases, adding a leading or
trailing space tells _Zero_ not to apply alignment to this cell, e.g., `
[Angle ] ` instead of ` [Angle] ` .

![Number alignment in tables](https://github.com/user-

In addition, you can prefix or suffix a numeral with content wrapped by the
function ` nonum[] ` to mark it as _not belonging to the number_ . The
remaining content may still be recognized as a number and formatted/aligned
accordingly.



    #ztable(
      format: (auto,),
      [#nonum[â¬]123.0#nonum(footnote[A special number])],
      [12.111],
    )


![Number alignment in tables](https://github.com/user-
attachments/assets/270ae789-2a8c-44a3-b3a9-0ca588bfbad3)

Zero not only aligns numbers at the decimal point but also at the uncertainty
and exponent part. Moreover, by passing a ` dictionary ` instead of ` auto ` ,
a set of ` num() ` arguments to apply to all numbers in a column can be
specified.



    #ztable(
      columns: 4,
      align: center,
      format: (none, auto, auto, (digits: 1)),
      $n$, $Î±$, $Î²$, $Î³$,
      [1], [3.45e2], [-11.1+-3], [0],
      ..
    )

==  Zero for third-party packages

This package provides some useful extras for third-party packages that
generate formatted numbers (for example graphics libraries).

Instead of passing a ` str ` to ` num() ` , it is also possible to pass a
dictionary of the form



    (
      mantissa:  str | int | float,
      e:         none | str,
      pm:        none | array
    )


This way, parsing the number can be avoided which makes especially sense for
packages that generate numbers (e.g., tick labels for a diagram axis) with
independent mantissa and exponent.

Furthermore, ` num() ` also allows ` array ` arguments for ` number ` which
allows for more efficient batch-processing of numbers with the same setup. In
this case, the caller of the function needs to provide ` context ` .

==  Changelog

===  Version 0.3.0

  - Adds ` nonum[] ` function that can be used to mark content in cells as _not belonging to the number_ . The remaining content may still be recognized as a number and formatted/aligned accordingly. The content wrapped by ` nonum[] ` is preserved.
  - Fixes number alignment tables with new version Typst 0.12.

===  Version 0.2.0

  - Adds support for using non-math fonts for ` num ` via the option ` math ` . This can be activated by calling ` #set-num(math: false) ` .
  - Performance improvements for both ` num() ` and ` ztable(9) `

==  How to Compile

This project contains an example setup that splits individual chapters into
different files.
This can cause problems when using references etc.
These problems can be avoided by following these steps:

  - Make sure to always compile your ` main.typ ` file which includes all of your chapters for references to work correctly.
  - VSCode:
    - Install the [ Tinymist Typst ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extension.
    - Make sure to start the ` PDF ` or ` Live Preview ` only from within your ` main.typ ` file.
    - If problems occur it usually helps to close the preview and restart it from your ` main.typ ` file.

0.1.0

Basic shadows for Typst

Featured  Package

Umbra is a library for drawing basic gradient shadows in [ typst
](https://typst.app/) . It currently provides only one function for drawing a
shadow along one edge of a path.

==  Examples

===  Basic Shadow

[
![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/umbra/0.1.0/gallery/basic.png)
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/umbra/0.1.0/gallery/basic.typ)

===  Neumorphism

](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/umbra/0.1.0/gallery/neumorphism.typ)

===  Torn Paper

[
![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/umbra/0.1.0/gallery/torn-
paper.png)
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/umbra/0.1.0/gallery/torn-
paper.typ)

_Click on the example image to jump to the code._

==  Usage

The following code creates a very basic square shadow:



    #import "@preview/umbra:0.1.0": shadow-path

    #shadow-path((10%, 10%), (10%, 90%), (90%, 90%), (90%, 10%), closed: true)


The function syntax is similar to the normal path syntax. The following
arguments were added:

  - ` shadow-radius ` (default ` 0.5cm ` ): The shadow size in the direction normal to the edge
  - ` shadow-stops ` (default ` (gray, white) ` ): The colours to be used in the shadow, passed directly to ` gradient `
  - ` correction ` (default ` 5deg ` ): A small correction factor to be added to round shadows at corners. Otherwise, there will be a small gap between the two shadows

===  Vertex Order

The order of the vertices defines the direction of the shadow. If the shadow
is the wrong way around, just reverse the vertices.

===  Transparency

This package is designed in such a way that it should support transparency in
the gradients (i.e. corners define shadows using a path which approximates the
arc, instead of an entire circle). However, typst doesnât currently support
transparency in gradients. ( [ issue
](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2546) ).

In addition, the aforementioned correction factor would likely cause issues
with transparent gradients.

0.1.1

A minimalistic LaTeX-style CV template for professionals.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=minimalistic-latex-cv&version=0.1.1)

This is a Typst template for a minimalistic LaTeX-style CV. It provides a
simple structure for a CV with a header, a section for professional
experience, a section for education, and a section for skills and languages.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` minimalistic-latex-cv ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/minimalistic-latex-cv


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` cv ` function with the following named arguments:

  - ` name ` : The name of the person.
  - ` metadata ` : A dictionary of metadata of the person to be displayed in the header.
  - ` photo ` : The path to the photo of the person.
  - ` lang ` : The language of the document.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
paper.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` cv `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/minimalistic-latex-cv:0.1.1": cv

    #show: cv.with(
      name: "Your Name",
      metadata: (
        email: "your@email.com",
        telephone: "+123456789",
      ),
      photo: image("photo.jpeg"),

= *codelst.md*

=  codelst

2.0.2

A typst package to render sourcecode.

*codelst* is a [ Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) package for
rendering sourcecode with line numbers and some other additions.

==  Usage

Import the package from the typst preview repository:



    #import "@preview/codelst:2.0.2": sourcecode


After importing the package, simply wrap any fenced code block in a call to `
#sourcecode() ` :



    #import "@preview/codelst:2.0.2": sourcecode

    #sourcecode[```typ
    #show "ArtosFlow": name => box[
      #box(image(
        "logo.svg",
        height: 0.7em,
      ))
      #name
    ]

    This report is embedded in the
    ArtosFlow project. ArtosFlow is a
    project of the Artos Institute.
    ```]


==  Further documentation

See ` manual.pdf ` for a comprehensive manual of the package.

See ` example.typ ` for some quick usage examples.

==  Development

The documentation is created using [ Mantys ](https://github.com/jneug/typst-
mantys) , a Typst template for creating package documentation.

To compile the manual, Mantys needs to be available as a local package. Refer
to Mantysâ manual for instructions on how to do so.

==  Changelog

===  v2.0.1

This version makes ` codelst ` compatible to Typst 0.11.0. Version 2.0.1 now
requires Typst 0.11.0, since there are some breaking changes to the way
counters work.

Thanks to @kilpkonn for theses changes.

===  v2.0.0

Version 2 requires Typst 0.9.0 or newer. Rendering is now done using the new `
raw.line ` elements get consistent line numbers and syntax highlighting (even
if ` showrange ` is used). Rendering is now done in a ` #table ` .

  - Added ` theme ` and ` syntaxes ` options to overwrite passed in ` #raw ` values.
  - Breaking: Renamed ` tab-indend ` to ` tab-size ` , to conform with the Typst option.
  - Breaking: Removed ` continue-numbering ` option for now. (The feature failed in combination with label parsing and line highlights.)
  - Breaking: Removed styling of line numbers via a ` show ` -rule.

===  v1.0.0

  - Complete rewrite of code rendering.
  - New options for ` #sourcecode() ` :
    - ` lang ` : Overwrite code language setting.
    - ` numbers-first ` : First line number to show.
    - ` numbers-step ` : Only show every n-th number.
    - ` frame ` : Set a frame (replaces ` <codelst> ` label.)
    - Merged ` line-numbers ` and ` numbering ` options.
  - Removed ` #numbers-style() ` function.
    - ` numbers-style ` option now gets passed ` counter.display() ` .
  - Removed ` <codelst> ` label.
  - ` codelst-style ` only sets ` breakable ` for figures.
  - New ` codelst ` function to setup a catchall show rules for ` raw ` text.
  - ` label-regex: none ` disables labels parsing.
  - Code improvements and refactorings.

===  v0.0.5

  - Fixed insets for line highlights.
  - Added ` numbers-width ` option to manually set width of line numbers column.
    - This allows line numbers on margins by setting ` numbers-width ` to ` 0pt ` or a negative number like ` -1em ` .

===  v0.0.4

  - Fixed issue with context unaware syntax highlighting.

===  v0.0.3

  - Removed call to ` #read() ` from ` #sourcefile() ` .
  - Added ` continue-numbering ` argument to ` #sourcecode() ` .
  - Fixed problem with ` showrange ` having out of range line numbers.

===  v0.0.2

  - Added a comprehensive manual.
  - Fixed crash for missing ` lang ` attribute in ` raw ` element.

===  v0.0.1

  - Initial version submitted to typst/packages.

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` codelst `

==  Change log

===  0.5.2

  - *Require` typst ` version ` >=0.12.0 ` . *
  - Update ` cetz ` dependency to ` 0.3.1 ` . *Note:* This may slightly change edge label positions.
  - Add ` loop-angle ` option to ` edge() ` (#36).

===  0.5.1

  - Fix nodes which ` enclose ` absolute coordinates.
  - Allow CeTZ-style coordinate expressions in node ` enclose ` option.
  - Fix crash with polar coordinates.
  - Fix edges which bend at 0deg or 180deg (e.g., ` edge("r,r") ` or ` edge("r,l") ` ) and enhance the way the corner radius adapts to the bend angle. *Note:* This may change diagram layout from previous versions.
  - Improve error messages.
  - Add marks for crowâs foot notation: ` n ` (many), ` n? ` (zero or more), ` n! ` (one or more), ` 1 ` (one), ` 1? ` (zero or one), ` 1! ` (exactly one).
  - Add ` node-shape ` option to ` diagram() ` .

===  0.5.0

  - Greatly enhance coordinate system.
    - Support CeTZ-style coordinate expressions (relative, polar, interpolating, named coordinates, etc).
    - Absolute coordinates (physical lengths) can be used alongside âelasticâ coordinates (row/column positions).
  - Add ` label-angle ` option to ` edge() ` .
  - Add ` label-wrapper ` option to allow changing the label inset, outline stroke, and so on (#26).
  - Add ` label-size ` option to control default edge label text size (#35)
  - Add ` trapezium ` node shape.
  - Disallow string labels to be passed as positional arguments to ` edge() ` (to eliminate ambiguity). Used named argument or pass content instead.

===  0.4.5

  - Add isosceles triangle node shape (#31).
  - Add ` fit ` and ` dir ` options to various node shapes to adjust sizing and orientation.
  - Allow more than one consecutive edge to have an implicit end vertex.
  - Allow ` snap-to ` to be ` none ` to disable edge snapping (#32).

===  0.4.4

  - Support fully customisable marks/arrowheads!
    - Added new mark styles and tweaked some existing defaults. *Note.* This may change the micro-typography of diagrams from previous versions.
  - Add node groups via the ` enclose ` option of ` node() ` .
  - Node labels can be aligned inside the node with ` align() ` .
  - Node labels wrap naturally when label text is wider than the node. *Note:* This may change diagram layout from previous versions.
  - Add a ` layer ` option to nodes and edges to control drawing order.
  - Add node shapes: ` ellipse ` , ` octagon ` .

===  0.4.3

  - Fixed edge crossing backgrounds being drawn above nodes (#14).
  - Add ` fletcher.hide() ` to hide elements with/without affecting layout, useful for incremental diagrams in slides (#15).
  - Support ` shift ` ing edges by coordinate deltas as well as absolute lengths (#13).
  - Support node names (#8).

===  0.4.2

  - Improve edge-to-node snapping. Edges can terminate anywhere near a node (not just at its center) and will automatically snap to the node outline. Added ` snap-to ` option to ` edge() ` .
  - Fix node ` inset ` being half the amount specified. If upgrading from previous version, you will need to divide node ` inset ` values by two to preserve diagram layout.
  - Add ` decorations ` option to ` edge() ` for CeTZ path decorations ( ` "wave" ` , ` "zigzag" ` , and ` "coil" ` , also accepted as positional string arguments).

===  0.4.1

  - Support custom node shapes! Edges connect to node outlines automatically.
    - New ` shapes ` submodule, containing ` diamond ` , ` pill ` , ` parallelogram ` , ` hexagon ` , and other node shapes.
  - Allow edges to have multiple segments.
    - Add ` vertices ` an ` corner-radius ` options to ` edge() ` .
    - Relative coordinate shorthands may be comma separated to signify multiple segments, e.g., ` "r,u,ll" ` .
  - Add ` dodge ` option to ` edge() ` to adjust end points.
  - Support ` cetz:0.2.0 ` .

===  0.4.0

  - Add ability to specify diagrams in math-mode, using ` & ` to separate nodes.
  - Allow implicit and relative edge coordinates, e.g., ` edge("d") ` becomes ` edge(prev-node, (0, 1)) ` .
  - Add ability to place marks anywhere along an edge. Shorthands now accept an optional middle mark, for example ` |->-| ` and ` hook-/->> ` .
  - Add âhanging tailâ correction to marks on curved edges. Marks now rotate a bit to fit more comfortably along tightly curving arcs.
  - Add more arrowheads for the sake of it: ` }> ` , ` <{ ` , ` / ` , ` \ ` , ` x ` , ` X ` , ` * ` (solid dot), ` @ ` (solid circle).
  - Add ` axes ` option to ` diagram() ` to control the direction of each axis in the diagramâs coordinate system.
  - Add ` width ` , ` height ` and ` radius ` options to ` node() ` for explicit control over size.
  - Add ` corner-radius ` option to ` node() ` .
  - Add ` stroke ` option to ` edge() ` replacing ` thickness ` and ` paint ` options.
  - Add ` edge-stroke ` option to ` diagram() ` replacing ` edge-thickness ` .

===  0.3.0

  - Make round-style arrow heads better approximate the default math font.
  - Add solid arrow heads with shorthand ` <|- ` , ` -|> ` and double-bar ` ||- ` , ` -|| ` .
  - Add an ` extrude ` option to ` node() ` which duplicates and extrudes the nodeâs stroke, enabling double stroke effects.

===  0.2.0

  - Experimental support for customising arrowheads.
  - Add right-angled edges with ` edge(..., corner: left/right) ` .

This template can be used for extensive documentation as well as for final
theses such as bachelor theses.

It is characterised by the fact that it is highly customisable despite the
predefined design.

Initially, all template parameters are optional by default. It is then
suitable for documentation. To make it suitable for theses, only one parameter
needs to be changed.

0.1.1

Simple page numbering of front and back matter.

This typst packages allows you to simply mark the end and start of your front
matter and back matter to change style and value of your page number without
manually setting and keeping track of inner and outer page counters.

==  Example



    #import "@preview/anti-matter:0.1.1": anti-matter, fence, set-numbering

    #set page("a4", height: auto)
    #show heading.where(level: 1): it => pagebreak(weak: true) + it

    #show: anti-matter

    #set-numbering(none)
    #align(center)[My Title Page]
    #pagebreak()
    #set-numbering("I")

    #include "front-matter.typ"
    #fence()

    #include "chapters.typ"
    #fence()

    #include "back-matter.typ"


![An example outline showing the outer Roman numbering interrupted by
temporary inner Arabic

numbering](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/anti-
matter/0.1.1/example/example.png)

==  Features

  - Marking the start and end of front/back matter.
  - Specifying the numbering styles for each part fo the document

==  FAQ

  1. Why are the pages not correctly counted?
     - If you are setting your own page header, you must use ` step ` , see section II in the [ manual ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/anti-matter/0.1.1/docs/manual.pdf) .
  2. Why is my outline not displaying the correct numbering?
     - If you configure your own ` outline.entry ` , you must use ` page-number ` , see section II in the [ manual ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/anti-matter/0.1.1/docs/manual.pdf) .
  3. Why does my front/inner/back matter numbering start on the wrong page?
     - The fences must be on the last page of their respective part, if you have a ` pagebreak ` forcing them on the next page it will also incorrectly label that page.
     - Otherwise please open an issue with a minimal reproducible example.

==  Etymology

The package name ` anti-matter ` was choosen as a word play on front/back

        Recent advances in space-based document processing have enabled faster mail delivery between different planets of a solar system. Given the time it takes for a message to be transmitted from one planet to the next, its estimated that even a one-way trip to a distant destination could take up to one year. During these periods of interplanetary mail delivery there is a slight possibility of mail being lost in transit. This issue is considered so serious that space management employs P.I. agents to track down and retrieve lost mail. We propose A-Mail, a new anti-matter based approach that can ensure that mail loss occurring during interplanetary transit is unobservable and therefore potentially undetectable. Going even further, we extend A-Mail to predict problems and apply existing and new best practices to ensure the mail is delivered without any issues. We call this extension AI-Mail.

=  minimal-presentation

0.3.0

A modern minimalistic presentation template ready to use

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=minimal-presentation&version=0.3.0)

A modern minimalistic presentation template ready to use.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` minimal-presentation ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/minimal-presentation


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` project ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` title ` : The bookâs title as content.
  - ` sub-title ` : The bookâs subtitle as content.
  - ` author ` : Content or an array of content to specify the author.
  - ` aspect-ratio ` : Defaults to ` 16-9 ` . Can be also ` 4-3 ` .

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
book.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` project
` function in a show rule. If you, however, want to change an existing project
to use this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your
file:



    #import "@preview/minimal-presentation:0.1.0": *

    #set text(font: "Lato")
    #show math.equation: set text(font: "Lato Math")
    #show raw: set text(font: "Fira Code")

==  Getting Started

To make use of the ` ionio-illustrate ` package, youâll need to add it to
your project like shown below. Make sure you are importing a version that
supports your end goal.



    #import "@preview/ionio-illustrate:0.2.0": *


Then, load in your mass spectrum data and pass it through to the package like
so. Data should be 2D array, and by default the mass-charge ratio is in the
first column, and the relative intensities are in the second column.



    #let data = csv("isobutelene_epoxide.csv")

    #let ms = mass-spectrum(massspec, args: (
      size: (12,6),
      range: (0,100),
    ))

    #figure((ms.display)())


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/ionio-
illustrate/0.2.0/gallery/isobulelene_epoxide.typ.png)

There are many ways to further enhance your spectrum, please check out the
manual to find out how.

0.1.0

An example package.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=classic-aau-report&version=0.1.0)

Unofficial Typst template for project reports at Aalborg University (AAU).
This is based on the LaTeX template [
https://github.com/jkjaer/aauLatexTemplates
](https://github.com/jkjaer/aauLatexTemplates) .

The template is generic to any field of study, but defaults to Computer
Science.

==  Usage

Click âCreate project in appâ.

Or via the CLI



    typst init @preview/classic-aau-report


*NOTE:* The template tries to use the ` Palatino Linotype ` font, which is
_not_ available in Typst. It is available [ here
](https://github.com/Tinggaard/classic-aau-report/tree/main/fonts)

To use it in the _web-app_ , put the ` .ttf ` files anywhere in the project
tree.

To use it _locally_ specify the ` --font-path ` flag (or see the [ docs
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-font) ).

==  Confugiration

The ` project ` function takes the following (optional) arguments:

  - ` meta ` : Metadata about the project

    - ` project-group ` : The project group name
    - ` participants ` : A list of participants
    - ` supervisors ` : A list of supervisors
    - ` field-of-study ` : The field of study
    - ` project-type ` : The type of project
  - ` en ` : English project info

    - ` title ` : The title of the project
    - ` theme ` : The theme of the project
    - ` abstract ` : The English abstract of the project

    - ` theme ` : The theme of the project in Danish
    - ` abstract ` : The Danish abstract of the project
    - ` department ` : The department name in Danish
    - ` department-url ` : The Danish department URL

The defaults are as follows:



    #let defaults = (
      meta: (
        project-group: "No group name provided",
        participants: (),
        supervisors: (),
        field-of-study: "Computer Science",
        project-type: "Semester Project"
      ),
      en: (
        title: "Untitled",
        theme: "",
        abstract: [],
        department: "Department of Computer Science",
        department-url: "https://www.cs.aau.dk",
      ),
      dk: (
        title: "Uden titel",
        theme: "",
        abstract: [],
        department: "Institut for Datalogi",
        department-url: "https://www.dat.aau.dk",
      ),
    )


Furthermore, the template exports the shawrules

  - ` frontmatter ` : Sets the page numbering to arabic and chapter numbering to none
  - ` mainmatter ` : Sets the chapter numbering ` Chapter ` followed by a number.
  - ` backmatter ` : Sets the chapter numbering back to none
  - ` appendix ` : Sets the chapter numbering to ` Appeendix ` followed by a letter.

To use it in an existing project, add the following show rule to the top of
your file.



    #include "@preview/classic-aau-report:0.1.0": project, frontmatter, mainmatter, backmatter, appendix

    // Any of the below can be omitted, the defaults are either empty values or CS specific
    #show: project.with(
      meta: (
        project-group: "CS-xx-DAT-y-zz",
        participants: (
          "Alice",
          "Bob",
          "Chad",
        ),
        supervisors: "John McClane"
      ),

A package and template for drafting legislative content in a German-style

---|---|---

A package and template for drafting legislative content in a German-style
structuring, such as for bylaws, etc.

While the template is designed to be used in German documents, all strings are
customizable. You can have a look at the ` delegis.typ ` to see all available
parameters.

==  General Usage

While this ` README.md ` gives you a brief overview of the packageâs usage,
we recommend that you use the template (in the ` template ` folder) as a
starting point instead.

===  Importing the Package



    #import "@preview/delegis:0.3.0": *


===  Initializing the template



    #show: delegis.with(
      // Metadata
      title: "Vereinsordnung zu ABCDEF", // title of the law/bylaw/...
      abbreviation: "ABCDEFVO", // abbreviation of the law/bylaw/...
      resolution: "3. Beschluss des Vorstands vom 24.01.2024", // resolution number and date
      in-effect: "24.01.2024", // date when it comes into effect
      draft: false, // whether this is a draft
      // Template
      logo: image("wuespace.jpg", alt: "WÃ¼Space e. V."), // logo of the organization, shown on the first page
    )


===  Sections

Sections are auto-detected as long as they follow the pattern ` Â§ 1 ... ` or
` Â§ 1a ... ` in its own paragraph:



    Â§ 1 Geltungsbereich

    (1)
    Diese Ordnung gilt fÃ¼r alle Mitglieder des Vereins.

    (2)
    Sie regelt die Mitgliedschaft im Verein.

    Â§ 2 Mitgliedschaft

    (1)
    Die Mitgliedschaft im Verein ist freiwillig.

    (2)
    Sie kann jederzeit gekÃ¼ndigt werden.

    Â§ 2a Ehrenmitgliedschaft

    (1)
    Die Ehrenmitgliedschaft wird durch den Vorstand verliehen.


Alternatively (or if you want to use special characters otherwise not
supported, such as ` * ` ), you can also use the ` #section[number][title] `
function:



    #section[Â§ 3][Administrator*innen]


===  Hierarchical Divisions

If you want to add more structure to your sections, you can use normal Typst
headings. Note that only the level 6 headings are reserved for the section
numbers:



    = Allgemeine Bestimmungen

    Â§ 1 ABC

    Â§ 2 DEF

    = Besondere Bestimmungen

    Â§ 3 GHI

    Â§ 4 JKL


Delegis will automatically use a numbering scheme for the divisions that is in
line with the âHandbuch der RechtsfÃ¶rmlichkeitâ, Rn. 379 f. If you want
to customize the division titles, you can do so by setting the ` division-
prefixes ` parameter in the ` delegis ` function:



    #show: delegis.with(
      division-prefixes: ("Teil", "Kapitel", "Abschnitt", "Unterabschnitt")
    )


===  Sentence Numbering

If a paragraph contains multiple sentences, you can number them by adding a `
#s~ ` at the beginning of the sentences:



    Â§ 3 MitgliedsbeitrÃ¤ge

    #s~Die MitgliedsbeitrÃ¤ge sind monatlich zu entrichten.
    #s~Sie sind bis zum 5. des Folgemonats zu zahlen.


This automatically adds corresponding sentence numbers in superscript.

===  Referencing other Sections

Referencing works manually by specifying the section number. While automations
would be feasible, we have found that in practice, theyâre not as useful as
they might seem for legislative documents.

In some cases, referencing sections using ` Â§ X ` could be mis-interpreted as
a new section. To avoid this, use the non-breaking space character ` ~ `
between the ` Â§ ` and the number:



    Â§ 5 Inkrafttreten

    Diese Ordnung tritt am 24.01.2024 in Kraft. Â§~4 bleibt unberÃ¼hrt.


==  Changelog

===  v0.3.0

====  Features

  - Adjust numbered list / enumeration numbering to be in line with âHandbuch der RechtsfÃ¶rmlichkeitâ, Rn. 374
  - Make division titles (e.g., âPartâ, âChapterâ, âDivisionâ) customizable and conform to the âHandbuch der RechtsfÃ¶rmlichkeitâ, Rn. 379 f.

===  v0.2.0

====  Features

  - Add ` #metadata ` fields for usage with ` typst query ` . You can now use ` typst query file.typ "<field>" --field value --one ` with ` <field> ` being one of the following to query metadata fields in the command line:
    - ` <title> `
    - ` <abbreviation> `
    - ` <resolution> `
    - ` <in-effect> `
  - Add ` #section[Â§ 1][ABC] ` function to enable previously unsupported special chars (such as ` * ` ) in section headings. Note that this was previously possible using ` #unnumbered[Â§ 1\ ABC] ` , but the new function adds a semantically better-fitting alternative to this fix.
  - Improve heading style rules. This also fixes an incompatibility with ` pandoc ` , meaning itâs now possible to use ` pandoc ` to convert delegis documents to HTML, etc.
  - Set the footnote numbering to ` [1] ` to not collide with sentence numbers.

====  Bug Fixes

  - Fix a typo in the ` str-draft ` variable name that lead to draft documents resulting in a syntax error.
  - Fix hyphenation issues with the abbreviation on the title page (hyphenation between the parentheses and the abbreviation itself)

=  lucky-icml

0.2.1

ICML-style paper template to publish at conferences for International
Conference on Machine Learning

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=lucky-icml&version=0.2.1)

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking _Start from
template_ on the dashboard and searching for ` lucky-icml ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/lucky-icml


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` icml2024 ` function with the following named
arguments.

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` authors ` : An array of author dictionaries. Each of the author dictionaries must have a name key and can have the keys department, organization, location, and email.
  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or none. Appears at the top under the title.
  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the bibliography function or none. The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the paper.
  - ` accepted ` : If this is set to ` false ` then anonymized ready for submission document is produced; ` accepted: true ` produces camera-redy version. If the argument is set to ` none ` then preprint version is produced (can be uploaded to arXiv).

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` icml2024
` function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use
this template, you can add a show rule at the top of your file.

==  Issues

This template is developed at [ daskol/typst-templates
](https://github.com/daskol/typst-templates) repo. Please report all issues
there.

===  Running Title

  1. Runing title should be 10pt above the main text. With top margin 1in it gives that a solid line should be located at 62pt. Actual, position is 57pt in the original template.
  2. Default value between header ruler and header text baseline is 4pt in ` fancyhdr ` . But actual value is 3pt due to thickness of a ruler in 1pt.

===  Page Numbering

  1. Basis line of page number should be located 25pt below of main text. There is a discrepancy in about ~1pt.

===  Heading

  1. Required space after level 3 headers is 0.1in or 7.2pt. Actual space size is large (e.g. distance between Section 2.3.1 header and text after it about 12pt).

===  Figures and Tables

  1. At the moment Typst has limited support for multi-column documents. It allows define multi-column blocks and documents but there is no ability to typeset complex layout (e.g. page width figures or tables in two-column documents).

===  Citations and References

  1. There is a small bug in CSL processor which fails to recognize bibliography entries with ` chapter ` field. It is already report and will be fixed in the future.

  2. There is no suitable bibliography style so we use default APA while ICML requires APA-like style but not exact APA. The difference is that ICML APA-like style places entry year at the end of reference entry. In order to fix the issue, we need to describe ICML bibliography style in CSL-format.

  3. In the original template links are colored with dark blue. We can reproduce appearance with some additional effort. First of all, ` icml2024.csl ` shoule be updated as follows.

        diff --git a/icml/icml2024.csl b/icml/icml2024.csl
    index 3b9e9a2..3fe9f74 100644

    +++ b/icml/icml2024.csl
    @@ -1648,7 +1648,8 @@

Then instead of convenient citation shortcut ` @cite-key1 @cite-key2 ` , one
should use special procedure ` refer ` with variadic arguments.

0.1.2

Date and time formatting using ICU4X via WASM

This library is a wrapper around [ ICU4X ](https://github.com/unicode-
org/icu4x) â ` datetime ` formatting for Typst which provides
internationalized formatting for dates, times, and timezones.

As the WASM bundle includes all localization data, itâs quite large (about 8
MiB).

See [ nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ ](https://nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ) for a
full API reference with more examples.

==  Example



    #import "@preview/icu-datetime:0.1.2": fmt-date, fmt-time, fmt-datetime, experimental
    // These functions may change at any time
    #import experimental: fmt-timezone, fmt-zoned-datetime

    #let day = datetime(
      year: 2024,
      month: 5,
      day: 31,
    )
    #let time = datetime(
      hour: 18,
      minute: 2,

    )
    #let dt = datetime(

      month: 5,
      day: 31,
      hour: 18,
      minute: 2,
      second: 23,
    )
    #let tz = (
      offset: "-07",
      iana: "America/Los_Angeles",
      zone-variant: "st", // standard
    )

    = Dates

    #fmt-zoned-datetime(dt, tz) \
    #fmt-zoned-datetime(dt, tz, locale: "lv") \
    #fmt-zoned-datetime(dt, tz, locale: "en-CA-u-hc-h24-ca-buddhist")


![Example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/icu-
datetime/0.1.2/res/example.png)

Locales must be [ Unicode Locale Identifier
](https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35.html#Unicode_locale_identifier) s. Use
[ ` locale-info(locale) ` ](https://nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ/locale-info/) to
get information on how a locale is parsed. Unicode extensions are supported,
so you can, for example, set the hour cycle with ` hc-h12 ` or set the
calendar with ` ca-buddhist ` (e.g. ` en-CA-u-hc-h24-ca-buddhist ` ).

==  Documentation

Documentation can be found on [ nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ
](https://nerixyz.github.io/icu-typ) .

==  Using Locally

Download the [ latest release ](https://github.com/Nerixyz/icu-typ/releases) ,
unzip it to your [ local Typst packages
](https://github.com/typst/packages#local-packages) , and use ` #import
"@local/icu-datetime:0.1.2" ` .

==  Building

To build the library, you need to have [ Rust ](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ,
[ just ](https://just.systems/) , and [ ` wasm-opt `
](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) installed.



    just build
    # to deploy the package locally, use `just deploy`


While developing, you can symlink the WASM file into the root of the
repository (itâs in the ` .gitignore ` ):



    # Windows (PowerShell)
    New-Item icu-datetime.wasm -ItemType SymbolicLink -Value ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/icu_typ.wasm
    # Unix
    ln -s ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/icu_typ.wasm icu-datetime.wasm


Use ` cargo b --target wasm32-unknown-unknown ` to build in debug mode.

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` icu-datetime `



    #import "@preview/icu-datetime:0.1.2"

= *conchord.md*

=  conchord

0.2.0

Easily write lyrics with chords, generate chord diagrams and tabs.

Featured  Package

> Notice: Iâm preparing the update, so the documentation there is referring
> to the new version.

` conchord ` (concise chord) is a [ Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst)
package to write lyrics with chords and generate colorful fretboard diagram
(aka chord diagram). From ` 0.1.1 ` there is also experimental tabs support
(though quite simple and unstable yet). It is inspired by [ chordx
](https://github.com/ljgago/typst-chords) package and my previous tiny project
for generating chord diagrams SVG-s.

` conchord ` makes it easy to add new chords, both for diagrams and lyrics.
Unlike [ chordx ](https://github.com/ljgago/typst-chords) , you donât need
to think about layout and pass lots of arrays for drawing barres. Just pass a
string with held frets and it will work:



    #import "@preview/conchord:0.2.0": new-chordgen, overchord

    #let chord = new-chordgen()

    #box(chord("x32010", name: "C"))
    #box(chord("x33222", name: "F#m/C#"))
    #box(chord("x,9,7,8,9,9"))


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/conchord/0.2.0/examples/simple.png)

> ` x ` means closed string, ` 0 ` is open, other number is a fret. In case of
> frets larger than ` 9 ` frets should be separated with commas, otherwise you
> can list them without any separators.

> Chord diagram works like a usual block, so to put them into one line you
> need to wrap them into boxes. In real code it is recommended to create a
> wrapper function to customize box margins etc (see larger example below).

It is easy to customize the colors and styles of chords with ` colors `
argument and ` show ` rules for text. You can also put ` ! ` and ` * ` marks
in the end of the string to force diagram generation. ` ! ` forces barre, ` *
` removes it:



    #let custom-chord = new-chordgen(string-number: 3,
        colors: (shadow-barre: orange,
            grid: gray.darken(30%),
            hold: red,
            barre: purple)
    )

    #set text(fill: purple)
    #box(custom-chord("320", name: "C"))
    #box(custom-chord("2,4,4,*", name: "Bm"))
    #box(custom-chord("2,2,2, *"))
    #box(custom-chord("x,3,2, !"))


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/conchord/0.2.0/examples/crazy.png)

> NOTE: be careful when using *!* , if barre cannot be used, it will result
> into nonsense.

For lyrics, you donât need to add chord to word and specify the number of
char in words (unlike [ chordx ](https://github.com/ljgago/typst-chords) ).
Simply add ` #overchord ` to the place you want a chord. Compose with native
Typst stylistic things for non-plain look (you donât need to dig into [
chordx ](https://github.com/ljgago/typst-chords) âs custom arguments):



    #let och(it) = overchord(strong(it))

    === #raw("[Verse 1]")

    #och[Em] Another head
    #och[C] hangs lowly \
    #och[G] Child is slowly
    #och[D] taken

    ...


> Complete example of lyrics with chords (see [ full source
> ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/conchord/0.2.0/examples/zombie.typ)
> ):

![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/conchord/0.2.0/examples/zombie.png)

I was quite amazed with general idea of [ chordx
](https://github.com/ljgago/typst-chords) , but a bit frustated with
implementation, so I decided to quickly rewrite my old js code to Typst. I use
` cetz ` there, so code is quite clean.

> Note: This package doesnât use any piece of [ chordx
> ](https://github.com/ljgago/typst-chords) , only the general idea is taken.

Brief comparison may be seen there, some concepts explained below:

![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/conchord/0.2.0/examples/compare.png)

==  Think about frets, not layout

Write frets for chord as you hold it, like a string like â123456â (see
examples above). You donât need to think about layouting and subtracting
frets, ` conchord ` does it for you.

> NOTE: I canât guarantee that will be the best chord layout. Moreover, the
> logic is quite simple: e.g., barre canât be multiple and canât be put
> anywhere except first bar in the image. However, surprisingly, it works well
> in almost all of the common cases, so the exceptions are really rare.

If you need to create something too _custom/complex_ ~~(but not _concise_ ) ~~
, maybe it is worth to try [ chordx ](https://github.com/ljgago/typst-chords)
. You can also try using core function ` render-chord ` for more manual
control, but it is still limited by one barre starting from one (but that
barre may be shifted). If you think that feature should be supported, you can
create issue there.

==  Shadow barre

Some chord generators put barre only where it _ought to_ be (any less will not
hold some strings). Others put it where it can be (sometimes maximal size,
sometimes some other logic). I use simple barre where it *ought to* be, and
add _shadow barre_ where it *could* maximally be. You can easily disable it
by either setting ` use-shadow-barre: false ` on ` new-chordgen ` (only
necessary part of barre rendered) or by setting color of ` shadow-barre ` the
same as ` barre ` (maximal possible barre).

==  Name auto-scaling

Chord name font size is _reduced_ for _large_ chord names, so the name fits
well into chord diagram (see example above). That makes it much more pretty to
stack several chords together. To achieve chordx-like behavior, you can always
use ` #figure(chord("â¦"), caption: â¦) ` .

==  Easier chords for lyrics

Just add chord labels above lyrics in arbitrary place, donât think about
what letter exactly it should be located. By default it aligns the chord label
to the left, so it produces pretty results out-of-box. You can pass other
alignments to ` alignment ` argument, or use the chords straight inside words.

The command is _much_ simpler than chordx (of course, it is a trade-off):



    #let overchord(body, align: start, height: 1em, width: -0.25em) = box(place(align, body), height: 1em + height, width: width)


Feel free to use it for your purposes outside of the package.

It takes on default ` -0.25em ` width to remove one adjacent space, so

  - To make it work on monospace/other special fonts, you will need to adjust ` width ` argument. The problem is that I canât ` measure ` space, but maybe that will be eventually fixed.
  - To add chord inside word, you have to add _one_ space, like ` wo #chord[Am]rd ` .

==  Colors

Customize the colors of chord elements. ` new-chordgen ` accepts the ` colors
` dictionary with following possible fields:

  - ` grid ` : color of grid, default is ` gray.darken(20%) `
  - ` open ` : color of circles for open strings, default is ` black `
  - ` muted ` : color of crosses for muted strings, default is ` black `
  - ` hold ` : color of held positions, default is ` #5d6eaf `
  - ` barre ` : color of main barre part, default is ` #5d6eaf `
  - ` shadow-barre ` : color of âunnecessaryâ barre part, default is ` #5d6eaf.lighten(30%) `

===  Customizing text

*Important* : _frets_ are rendered using ` raw ` elements. So if you want to
customize their font or color, please use ` #show raw: set text(fill: ...) `
or similar things.

The chordâs name, on the other hand, uses default font, so to set it, just
use ` #set text(font: ...) ` in the corresponding scope.

==  Assertions

Currently [ chordx ](https://github.com/ljgago/typst-chords) has almost no
checks inside for correctness of passed chords. ` conchord ` , on the other
side, checks for

  - Number of passed&parsed frets equal to set string-number
  - Only numbers and ` x ` passed as frets
  - All frets fitting in the diagram

> Everything there is highly experimental and unstable

![Tabs
example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/conchord/0.2.0/examples/tabs.png)



    #let chord = new-chordgen(scale-length: 0.6pt)

    #let ending(n) = {
        rect(stroke: (left: black, top: black), inset: 0.2em, n + h(3em))
        v(0.5em)
    }
    _This thing doesn't follow musical notation rules, it is used just for demonstration purposes_:

    #tabs.new(```

    Not a lot customization is available yet, but something is already possible:

    #show raw: set text(red.darken(30%), font: "Comic Sans MS")

    #tabs.new("0/1+2/5-1 ^0/1+`3/5-2.. 2/3 |: 2/3-1 2/3 2/3 | 3/3 ||",
      scale-length: 0.2cm,
      one-beat-length: 12,
      s-num: 5,
      colors: (
        lines: gradient.linear(yellow, blue),
        bars: green,
        connects: red
      ),
      enable-scale: false
    )


As you can see from example, you can use raw strings or code blocks to write
tabs, there is no real difference.

The general idea is very simple: to write a number on some line, write ` <fret
number>/<string> ` .

*Spaces are important!* All notes and special symbols work well only if
properly separated.

===  Duration

By default they will be quarter notes. To change that, you have to specify the
duration: ` <fret>/<string>-<duration> ` , where duration is $log_2$ from note
duration. So a whole note will be ` -0 ` , a half: ` -1 ` and so on. You can
also use as many dots as you want to multiply duration by 1.5, e.g. ` -2. `

Once you change the duration, all the following notes will use it, so you have
to specify duration every time it is changed (basically, always, but it really
depends on composition). Of course, you can just ignore all that duration
staff.

===  Bars and repetitions

To add simple bar, just add ` | ` . To add double bar line, use ` | | ` . To add end movement/composition, add ` || ` . To add repetitions, use ` |: ` and ` :| ` respectively.

===  Linebreaks

Notes and bars that donât fit in line will be automatically moved to next.
However, sometimes it isnât ideal and may be a bit bugged, so it is
recommended to do that manually, using ` \ ` .

The line is autoscaled if it is possible and not too ugly. You can change the
maximum and minimum scaling size with ` scale-max ` and ` scale-min ` . It is
also possible to completely disable scaling with ` enable-scale: false ` .

===  Ties and slides

You can _tie_ notes or _slide_ between them. To use ties, you have to add ` ^
` in front of _second_ tied note, like ` 1/1 ^3/1 ` . To use slides you have
to do the same, but with `.

_Current limitation:_ tying and sliding works only on the same string and may
work really bad if tied/slided through line break.

==  Bends and vibratos

Add ` b ` after note, but before the duration (e.g. ` 2/3b-2 ` ) to add a
bend. After ` b ` you can write custom text to be written on top (for example,
` b1/2 ` ). Add ` r ` to the end to add a release.

Adding vibratos works the same way, via adding ` v ` to the note. The length
of vibrato will be the same as the length of the note.

Unfortunately, they are all supported things for now. But wait, there is still
one cool thing left!

===  Custom content

Add any typst code you want between ` ## â¦ ## ` . It will be rendered with `
cetz ` on top of the line where you wrote it. That means you can write
_lyrics, chords, add complex things like endings_ , even *draw the elements
that are still missing* (well, it is still worth to create issue there, I
will try to do something).

That code is evaluated with ` eval ` , so you will need to pass dictionary to
` eval-scope ` with all things you want to use.

You can set align of these elements by writing cetz anchors after the second
(e.g., ` west ` , ` south ` and their combinations, like ` west-south ` ).

Additionally, if you enjoy drawing missing things, you can also use ` preamble
` and ` extra ` arguments in ` tabs.new ` where you can put any ` cetz ` inner
things (tabs uses canvas, and that allow you drawing on it) before or after
the tabs are drawn.

===  Plans

  1. Add _(optional)_ ârhythm sectionâ under tabs
  2. Add more signs&lines
  3. Add more built-in things to attach above tabs

It is far from what I want to do, so maybe there will be much more! I will be
very glad to receive _any feedback_ , both issues and PR-s are very welcome
(though I canât promise I will be able to work on it immediately)!

=  typearea

0.2.0

A KOMA-Script inspired package to better configure your typearea and margins.

A KOMA-Script inspired package to better configure your typearea and margins.



    #import "@preview/typearea:0.2.0": typearea

    #show: typearea.with(
      paper: "a4",
      div: 9,
      binding-correction: 11mm,
    )

    = Hello World


==  Reference

` typearea ` accepts the following options:

===  two-sided

Whether the document is two-sided. Defaults to ` true ` .

===  binding-correction

Binding correction. Defaults to ` 0pt ` .

Additional margin on the inside of a page when two-sided is true. If two-sided
is false it will be on the left or right side, depending on the value of `
binding ` . A ` binding ` value of ` auto ` will currently default to ` left `
.

Note: Before version 0.2.0 this was called ` bcor ` .

===  div

How many equal parts to split the page into. Controls the margins. Defautls to
` 9 ` .

The top and bottom margin will always be one and two parts respectively. In
two-sided mode the inside margin will be one part and the outside margin two
parts, so the combined margins between the text on the left side and the text
on the right side is the same as the margins from the outer edge of the text
to the outer edge of the page.

In one-sided mode the left and right margin will take 1.5 parts each.

===  header-height / footer-height

The height of the page header/footer.

===  header-sep / footer-sep

The distance between the page header/footer and the text area.

===  header-include / footer-include

Whether the header/footer should be counted as part of the text area when
calculating the margins. Defaults to ` false ` .

===  â¦rest

All other arguments are passed on to ` page() ` as is. You can see which
arguments ` page() ` accepts in the [ typst reference for the page function
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/) .

You should prefer this over calling or setting ` page() ` directly as doing so
could break some of ` typearea ` âs functionality.

===  How to add

        Recent advances in space-based document processing have enabled faster mail delivery between different planets of a solar system. Given the time it takes for a message to be transmitted from one planet to the next, its estimated that even a one-way trip to a distant destination could take up to one year. During these periods of interplanetary mail delivery there is a slight possibility of mail being lost in transit. This issue is considered so serious that space management employs P.I. agents to track down and retrieve lost mail. We propose A-Mail, a new anti-matter based approach that can ensure that mail loss occurring during interplanetary transit is unobservable and therefore potentially undetectable. Going even further, we extend A-Mail to predict problems and apply existing and new best practices to ensure the mail is delivered without any issues. We call this extension AI-Mail.

=  ctheorems

1.1.3

Numbered theorem environments for typst.

An implementation of numbered theorem environments in [ typst
](https://github.com/typst/typst) . Import using



    #import "@preview/ctheorems:1.1.3": *
    #show: thmrules


===  Features

  - Numbered theorem environments can be created and customized.
  - Environments can share the same counter, via same ` identifier ` s.
  - Environment counters can be _attached_ (just as subheadings are attached to headings) to other environments, headings, or keep a global count via ` base ` .
  - The depth of a counter can be manually set, via ` base_level ` .
  - Environments can be ` <label> ` 'd and ` @reference ` âd.
  - Awesome presets (coming soon!)

==  Manual and Examples

Get acquainted with ` ctheorems ` by checking out the minimal example below!

You can read the [ manual

==  Changelog

===  v1.1.3

  - Fixed alignment and block-breaking issues resulting from breaking changes in Typst 0.12.

===  v1.1.2

  - Introduced the ` thmproof ` function for creating proof environments.
  - Inserting ` #qedhere ` in a block equation/list/enum item (in a proof) places the qed symbol on the same line. The qed symbol can be customized via ` thmrules ` .

===  v1.1.1

  - Extra named arguments given to a theorem environment produced by ` thmbox ` (or ` thmplain ` ) are passed to ` block ` .

===  v1.1.0

  - The ` supplement ` (for references) is no longer set in ` thmenv ` . It can be passed to the theorem environment directly, along with ` refnumbering ` to control the appearance of ` @reference ` s.
  - Extra named arguments given to ` thmbox ` are passed to ` block ` .
  - Fixed spacing bug for unnumbered environments.
  - Replaced dummy figure with labelled metadata.

===  v1.0.0

  - Extra named arguments given to a theorem environment are passed to its formatting function ` fmt ` .
  - Removed ` thmref ` , introduced normal ` <label> ` s and ` @reference ` s.
  - Import must be followed by ` show: thmrules ` .
  - Removed ` name: ... ` from theorem environments; use ` #theorem("Euclid")[] ` instead of ` #theorem(name: "Euclid")[] ` .
  - Theorems are now wrapped in ` figure ` s.

=  mannot

0.1.0

A package for highlighting and annotating in math blocks.

A package for highlighting and annotating in math blocks in [ Typst
](https://typst.app/) .

A full documentation is [ here
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/mannot/0.1.0/docs/doc.pdf)
.

==  Example



    $
    mark(1, tag: #<num>) / mark(x + 1, tag: #<den>, color: #blue)
    + mark(2, tag: #<quo>, color: #red)

    #annot(<num>, pos: top)[Numerator]
    #annot(<den>)[Denominator]
    #annot(<quo>, pos: right, yshift: 1em)[Quotient]
    $


![Example1](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/mannot/0.1.0/examples/showcase.svg)

==  Usage

Import and initialize the package ` mannot ` on the top of your document.



    #import "@preview/mannot:0.1.0": *
    #show: mannot-init


To highlight a part of a math block, use the ` mark ` function:



    $
    mark(x)
    $


![Usage1](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/mannot/0.1.0/examples/usage1.svg)

You can also specify a color for the highlighted part:



    $ // Need # before color names.
    mark(3, color: #red) mark(x, color: #blue)
    + mark(integral x dif x, color: #green)
    $


![Usage2](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/mannot/0.1.0/examples/usage2.svg)

To add an annotation to a highlighted part, use the ` annot ` function. You
need to specify the tag of the marked content:



    $
    mark(x, tag: #<x>)  // Need # before tags.
    #annot(<x>)[Annotation]
    $


![Usage3](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/mannot/0.1.0/examples/usage3.svg)

You can customize the position of the annotation and the vertical distance
from the marked content:



    $
    mark(integral x dif x, tag: #<i>, color: #green)
    + mark(3, tag: #<3>, color: #red) mark(x, tag: #<x>, color: #blue)

    #annot(<i>, pos: left)[Set pos to left.]
    #annot(<i>, pos: top + left)[Top left.]
    #annot(<3>, pos: top, yshift: 1.2em)[Use yshift.]
    #annot(<x>, pos: right, yshift: 1.2em)[Auto arrow.]
    $


![Usage4](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/mannot/0.1.0/examples/usage4.svg)

For convenience, you can define custom mark functions:



    #let rmark = mark.with(color: red)
    #let gmark = mark.with(color: green)
    #let bmark = mark.with(color: blue)

    $
    integral_rmark(0, tag: #<i0>)^bmark(1, tag: #<i1>)
    mark(x^2 + 1, tag: #<i2>) dif gmark(x, tag: #<i3>)

    #annot(<i0>)[Begin]
    #annot(<i1>, pos: top)[End]
    #annot(<i2>, pos: top + right)[Integrand]
    #annot(<i3>, pos: right, yshift: .6em)[Variable]
    $


![Usage5](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/mannot/0.1.0/examples/usage5.svg)

1.0.0

Simple printable year calendar

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=october&version=1.0.0)

This template generates a monthly calendar, designed to be printed in
landscape.

The calendar function accepts one parameter for the year, which should be
formatted as an integer. Otherwise, the current year can be passed in with `
datetime.today().year() ` .



     #show: calendar.with(
      year: datetime.today().year()
    )


There isnât much space for writing in each day box, itâs more suited to
blocking out days with a highlighter. For example, to mark out free days in a
variable schedule of work shifts.

0.2.1

Customizable and flexible source-code blocks

Sourcerer is a Typst package for displaying stylized source code blocks, with
some extra features. Main features include:

  - Rendering source code with numbering
  - Rendering only a range of lines from the source code, keeping the original highlighting of the code (For example, block comments are still rendered well, even if cut)
  - Adding in-code line labels which are easily referenceable (via ` reference ` )
  - Considerable customization options for the display of the code block
  - Consistent and pretty cutoff between pages
  - Displaying the language used for a code block in a readable manner, in-code-block

First, import the package via:



    #import "@preview/sourcerer:0.2.1": code


Then, display custom code blocks via the ` code ` function, like so:



    #code(
      lang: "Typst",
      ```typ
      Woah, that's pretty #smallcaps(cool)!
      That's neat too.
      ```
    )


This results in:

=  gviz

0.1.0

Generate graphs using the graphviz dot language.

GViz is a typst plugin that can render graphviz graphs.

It uses [ https://codeberg.org/Sekoia/layout
](https://codeberg.org/Sekoia/layout) as a backend, which means it can
currently only render to SVG, and mostly supports basic features.

Import it like any other plugin: ` #import "@preview/gviz:0.1.0": * ` .

==  Usage



    #import "@preview/gviz:0.1.0": *

    #show raw.where(lang: "dot-render"): it => render-image(it.text)

    ```dot-render
    digraph mygraph {
      node [shape=box];
      A -> B;
      B -> C;
      B -> D;
      C -> E;
      D -> E;
      E -> F;
      A -> F [label="one"];
      A -> F [label="two"];
      A -> F [label="three"];
      A -> F [label="four"];
      A -> F [label="five"];
    }```

    #let my-graph = "digraph {A -> B}"
    #render-image(my-graph)

    SVG:
    #raw(render(my-graph), block: true, lang: "svg")


==  API

===  render

Renders a graph in dot language and returns SVG code for it.

Parameters:

  - code (string, bytes): Dot language code to be rendered.

2.0.0

Converter for ASCII representations of the International Phonetic Alphabet
(IPA)

ð ASCII / IPA conversion for Typst

This package allows you to easily convert different ASCII representations of
the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to and from the IPA. It also offers
some minor utilities to make phonetic transcriptions easier to use overall.
The package is being maintained [ here ](https://github.com/imatpot/typst-
ascii-ipa) .

Note: This is an extended port of the [ ` ipa-translate `
](https://github.com/tirimid/ipa-translate) Rust crate by [ tirimid
](https://github.com/tirimid) âs conversion features into native Typst. Most
conversions are implemented according to [ this Wikipedia article
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_ASCII_encodings_of_the_International_Phonetic_Alphabet)
which in turn relies of the official specifications of the respective ASCII
representations.

==  Conversion

The package supports multiple ASCII representations for the IPA with one
function each:

Notation  |  Function name
---|---
Branner  |  ` #branner(...) `
Praat  |  ` #praat(...) `
SIL  |  ` #sil(...) `
X-SAMPA  |  ` #xsampa(...) `

They all return the converted value as a [ ` string `
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) and accept the set of
same parameters:

Parameter  |  Type  |  Positional / Named  |  Default  |  Description
---|---|---|---|---
` value ` |  [ ` string ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/) |  positional  |  |  Main input to the function. Usually the transcription in the corresponsing ASCII-based notation.
` reverse ` |  [ ` bool ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bool/) |  named  |  ` false ` |  Reverses the conversion. Pass Unicode IPA into ` value ` to get the corresponsing ASCII-based notation back.

===  Examples

All examples use the Swiss German word [ â¨ChuchichÃ¤schtliâ©
[ËÏÊÏËiËÏÃ¦ÊËtlÉª]
](https://als.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuchich%C3%A4schtli) for the conversion.



    #import "@preview/ascii-ipa:2.0.0": *

    // returns "ËÏÊÏËiËÏÃ¦ÊËtlÉª"
    #branner("'XUX:i,Xae)S:tlI")

    // returns "'XUX:i,Xae)S:tlI"
    #branner("ËÏÊÏËiËÏÃ¦ÊËtlÉª", reverse: true)

    // returns "ËÏÊÏËiËÏÃ¦ÊËtlÉª"
    #praat("\\'1\\cf\\hs\\cf\\:f\\'2\\ae\\sh\\:ftl\\ic")

    // returns "\\'1\\cf\\hs\\cf\\:f\\'2\\ae\\sh\\:ftl\\ic"
    #praat("ËÏÊÏËiËÏÃ¦ÊËtlÉª", reverse: true)

    // returns "ËÏÊÏËiËÏÃ¦ÊËtlÉª"
    #sil("}x=u<x=:i}}x=a<s=:tli=")

    // returns "}x=u<x=:i}}x=a<s=:tli="
    #sil("ËÏÊÏËiËÏÃ¦ÊËtlÉª", reverse: true)

    // returns "ËÏÊÏËiËÏÃ¦ÊËtlÉª"
    #xsampa("\"XUX:i%X{S:tlI")

    // returns "\"XUX:i%X{S:tlI"
    #xsampa("ËÏÊÏËiËÏÃ¦ÊËtlÉª", reverse: true)


===  With ` raw `

You can also use [ ` raw ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/raw/) for
the conversion. This is useful if the notation uses a lot of backslashes.



    #import "@preview/ascii-ipa:2.0.0": praat

    // regular string
    #praat("\\'1\\cf\\hs\\cf\\:f\\'2\\ae\\sh\\:ftl\\ic")

    // raw
    #praat(`\'1\cf\hs\cf\:f\'2\ae\sh\:ftl\ic`)


Note: ` raw ` will not play nicely with notations that use ` ` ` a lot.

==  Brackets & Braces

You can easily mark your notation text as different types of brackets or
braces.



    #import "@preview/ascii-ipa:2.0.0": *

    #phonetic("prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²et") // [prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²et]
    #phnt("prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²et")     // [prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²et]

    #precise("prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²et") // â¦prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²etâ§
    #prec("prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²et")    // â¦prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²etâ§

    #phonemic("prÉªvet") // /prÉªvet/
    #phnm("prÉªvet")     // /prÉªvet/

    #morphophonemic("prÉªvet") // â«½prÉªvetâ«½
    #mphnm("prÉªvet")          // â«½prÉªvetâ«½

    #indistinguishable("prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²et") // (prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²et)
    #idst("prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²et")              // (prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²et)

    #obscured("prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²et") // â¸¨prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²etâ¸©
    #obsc("prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²et")     // â¸¨prÊ²ÉªËvÊ²etâ¸©

    #orthographic("Ð¿ÑÐ¸Ð²ÐµÑ") // â¨Ð¿ÑÐ¸Ð²ÐµÑâ©
    #orth("Ð¿ÑÐ¸Ð²ÐµÑ")         // â¨Ð¿ÑÐ¸Ð²ÐµÑâ©

= *gridlock.md*

=  gridlock

0.2.0

Grid typesetting in Typst

Grid typesetting in Typst. Use this package if you want to line up your body
text across columns and pages.

==  Example

![An example image showing a two-column page with headings, a block quote, a
footnote, a figure, a display formula, and a bulleted list. All body text in
both columns lines
up.](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/gridlock/0.2.0/docs/assets/example-
lines.png)

==  Getting Started



    #import "@preview/gridlock:0.2.0": *

    #show: gridlock.with()

    #lock[= This is a heading]

    #lorem(30)

    #figure(
      placement: auto,
      caption: [a caption],
      rect()
    )

    #lorem(30)


==  Usage

Check out [ the manual
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/gridlock/0.2.0/docs/gridlock-
manual.pdf) for a detailed description.

To get started, import the package into your document:



    #import "@preview/gridlock:0.2.0": *


Set up the basic parameters:



    #show: gridlock.with(
      paper: "a4",
      margin: (y: 76.445pt),
      font-size: 11pt,
      line-height: 13pt
    )


You can now use the ` lock() ` function to align any block to the text grid.
Block quotes bulleted/numbered lists, and floating figures do _not_ need to be
wrapped in ` lock() ` . Their spacing is handled fully automatically.



    #lock[= Heading]

    #lorem(50)

    #lock(figure(
      rect(),
      caption: [An example figure aligned to the grid.]
    ))

    #lorem(50)

    #lock[$ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 $]

    #lorem(50)


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` gridlock `



    #import "@preview/gridlock:0.2.0"

= *natrix.md*

=  natrix

0.1.0

Natural and consistent matrix for typst.

![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/natrix/0.1.0/natrix.svg)

` natrix.nat ` is a drop-in replacement for ` mat ` with some additional
features. ` nat ` ensures that each row in your matrix should have the similar
height, unless one of them becomes too tall.

At this moment, it is recommended to use ` nat ` only in display equations,
but not in inline equations. This is because ` nat ` looks a little bit off
when used in inline equations.

==  Documentation

===  ` nat `

Every thing is the same as ` mat ` in typst.

This package also provides ` bnat ` , ` Bnat ` , ` vnat ` , ` Vnat ` ,

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` natrix `



    #import "@preview/natrix:0.1.0"

aiaa-0.1.1-small.webp)

=  bamdone-aiaa

0.1.1

An American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) template for
conferences.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=bamdone-aiaa&version=0.1.1)

This is a Typst template for a one-column paper from the proceedings of the
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. The paper is tightly
spaced, fits a lot of content and comes preconfigured for numeric citations
from BibLaTeX or Hayagriva files.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` bamdone-aiaa ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/bamdone-aiaa


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` aiaa ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` authors-and-affiliations ` : An array of author dictionaries and affiliation dictionaries. Author dictionaries must have a ` name ` key and can have the keys ` job ` , ` department ` , ` aiaa ` is optional. Affiliation dictionaries must have the keys ` institution ` , ` city ` , ` state ` , ` zip ` , and ` country ` .
  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or ` none ` . Appears at the top of the first column in boldface. Shall be ` content ` .
  - ` paper-size ` : Defaults to ` us-letter ` . Specify a [ paper size string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-paper) to change the page format.
  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the ` bibliography ` function or ` none ` . Specifying this will configure numeric, AIAA-style citations.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
paper.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` aiaa `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/bamdone-aiaa:0.1.0": aiaa

    #show: aiaa.with(
      title: [A typesetting system to untangle the scientific writing process],
      abstract: [
        These instructions give you guidelines for preparing papers for AIAA Technical Papers. Use this document as a template if you are using Typst. Otherwise, use this document as an instruction set. Define all symbols used in the abstract. Do not cite references in the abstract. The footnote on the first page should list the Job Title and AIAA Member Grade for each author, if known. Authors do not have to be AIAA members.

Utilities for loading, normalizing and working with authors, affiliations,
abstracts, keywords and other frontmatter information common in scientific
publications. Our goal is to introduce standardized ways of working with this
content to expose metadata to scientific publishers who are interested in
using typst in a standardized way. The specification for this ` pubmatter ` is
based on [ MyST Markdown ](https://mystmd.org/) and [ Quarto
](https://quarto.org/) , and can load their YAML files directly.

==  Examples

Pubmatter was used to create these documents, for loading the authors in a
standardized way and creting the common elements (authors, affiliations,
ORCIDs, DOIs, Open Access Links, copyright statements, etc.)

==  Documentation

The full documentation can be found in [ docs.pdf
](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/docs.pdf) . To use `
pubmatter ` import it:



    #import "@preview/pubmatter:0.1.0"


The docs also use ` pubmatter ` , in a simplified way, you can see the [
docs.typ ](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/docs.typ) to see a
simple example of using various components to create a new document. Here is a
preview of the docs:

](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/docs.pdf)

===  Loading Frontmatter

The frontmatter can contain all information for an article, including title,
authors, affiliations, abstracts and keywords. These are then normalized into
a standardized format that can be used with a number of ` show ` functions
like ` show-authors ` . For example, we might have a YAML file that looks like
this:



    author: Rowan Cockett
    date: 2024/01/26


You can load that file with ` yaml ` , and pass it to the ` load ` function:



    #let fm = pubmatter.load(yaml("pubmatter.yml"))


This will give you a normalized data-structure that can be used with the `
show ` functions for showing various parts of a document.

You can also use a ` dictionary ` directly:



    #let fm = pubmatter.load((
      author: (
        (
          name: "Rowan Cockett",
          email: "rowan@curvenote.com",
          orcid: "0000-0002-7859-8394",
          affiliations: "Curvenote Inc.",
        ),
      ),
      date: datetime(year: 2024, month: 01, day: 26),
      doi: "10.1190/tle35080703.1",
    ))
    #pubmatter.show-author-block(fm)


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curvenote/pubmatter/main/images/author-
block.png?raw=true)

===  Theming

The theme including color and font choice can be set using the ` THEME `
state. For example, this document has the following theme set:



    #let theme = (color: red.darken(20%), font: "Noto Sans")
    #set page(header: pubmatter.show-page-header(theme: theme, fm), footer: pubmatter.show-page-footer(fm))
    #state("THEME").update(theme)


Note that for the ` header ` the theme must be passed in directly. This will
hopefully become easier in the future, however, there is a current bug that
removes the page header/footer if you set this above the ` set page ` . See [
https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2987
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pubmatter/0.1.0/#2987)
.

The ` font ` option only corresponds to the frontmatter content (abstracts,
title, header/footer etc.) allowing the body of your document to have a
different font choice.

===  Normalized Frontmatter Object

The frontmatter object has the following normalized structure:



    title: content
    subtitle: content
    short-title: string # alias: running-title, running-head
    # Authors Array
    # simple string provided for author is turned into ((name: string),)
    authors: # alias: author
      - name: string
        url: string # alias: website, homepage
        email: string
        phone: string
        fax: string
        orcid: string # alias: ORCID
        note: string
        corresponding: boolean # default: `true` when email set
        equal-contributor: boolean # alias: equalContributor, equal_contributor
        deceased: boolean
        roles: string[] # must be a contributor role
        affiliations: # alias: affiliation
          - id: string
            index: number
    # Affiliations Array
    affiliations: # alias: affiliation
      - string # simple string is turned into (name: string)
      - id: string
        index: number
        name: string
        institution: string # use either name or institution
    # Other publication metadata
    open-access: boolean
    license: # Can be set with a SPDX ID for creative commons
      id: string
      url: string
      name: string
    doi: string # must be only the ID, not the full URL
    date: datetime # validates from 'YYYY-MM-DD' if a string
    citation: content
    # Abstracts Array
    # content is turned into ((title: "Abstract", content: string),)
    abstracts: # alias: abstract
      - title: content
        content: content


Note that you will usually write the affiliations directly in line, in the
following example, we can see that the output is a normalized affiliation
object that is linked by the ` id ` of the affiliation (just the name if it is
a string!).



    #let fm = pubmatter.load((
      authors: (
        (
          name: "Rowan Cockett",
          affiliations: "Curvenote Inc.",
        ),
        (
          name: "Steve Purves",
          affiliations: ("Executable Books", "Curvenote Inc."),
        ),
      ),
    ))
    #raw(lang:"yaml", yaml.encode(fm))

=  icicle

0.1.0

Help the Typst Guys reach the helicopter pad and save Christmas!

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=icicle&version=0.1.0)

Help the Typst Guys reach the helicopter pad and save Christmas! Navigate them
with the WASD keys and solve puzzles with snowballs to make way for the Typst
Guys.

This small Christmas-themed game is playable in the Typst editor and best
enjoyed with the web app or ` typst watch ` . It was first released for the 24
Days to Christmas campaign in winter of 2023.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` icicle ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/icicle


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` game ` function, which accepts a positional
argument for the game input.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` game `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/icicle:0.1.0": game
    #show: game

    // Move with WASD.


You can also add your own levels by adding an array of level definition
strings in the ` game ` functionâs named ` levels ` argument. Each level
file must conform to the following format:

  - First, a line with two comma separated integers indicating the playerâs starting position.
  - Then, a matrix with the characters f (floor), x (wall), w (water), or g (goal).
  - Finally, a matrix with the characters b (snowball) or _ (nothing).

The three arguments must be separated by double newlines. Additionally, each
row in the matrices space-separates its values. Newlines terminate the rows.
Comments can be added with a double slash. Find an example for a valid level
string below:



    // The starting position
    0, 0

    // The back layer
    f f f w f f f
    f f f w f f f
    f f x w f f f
    f f f w f f f
    f f f w f x x
    x x x g x x x

    // The front layer.
    _ _ b _ _ _ _
    _ _ b _ _ _ _
    _ _ _ _ b _ _
    _ _ _ _ b _ _
    _ _ _ _ _ _ _
    _ _ _ _ _ _ _


Itâs best to put levels into separate files and load them with the ` read `
function.

= *unify.md*

=  unify

0.7.0

Format numbers, units, and ranges correctly.

Featured  Package

` unify ` is a [ Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) package simplifying
the typesetting of numbers, units, and ranges. It is the equivalent to
LaTeXâs ` siunitx ` , though not as mature.

==  Overview

` unify ` allows flexible numbers and units, and still mostly gets well
typeset results.



    #import "@preview/unify:0.7.0": num,qty,numrange,qtyrange

    $ num("-1.32865+-0.50273e-6") $
    $ qty("1.3+1.2-0.3e3", "erg/cm^2/s", space: "#h(2mm)") $
    $ numrange("1,1238e-2", "3,0868e5", thousandsep: "'") $
    $ qtyrange("1e3", "2e3", "meter per second squared", per: "/", delimiter: "\"to\"") $


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/unify/0.7.0/examples/overview.jpg)

Right now, physical, monetary, and binary units are supported. New issues or
pull requests for new units are welcome!

==  Multilingual support

The Unify package supports multiple languages. Currently, the supported
languages are English and Russian. The fallback is English. If you want to add
your language, you should add two files: ` prefixes-xx.csv ` and ` units-
xx.csv ` , and in the ` lib.typ ` file you should fix the ` lang-db ` state
for your files.

==  ` num `

` num ` uses string parsing in order to typeset numbers, including separators
between the thousands. They can have the following form:

  - ` float ` or ` integer ` number
  - either ( ` {} ` stands for a number)
    - symmetric uncertainties with ` +-{} `
    - asymmetric uncertainties with ` +{}-{} `
  - exponential notation ` e{} `

Parentheses are automatically set as necessary. Use ` thousandsep ` to change
the separator between the thousands, and ` multiplier ` to change the
multiplication symbol between the number and exponential.

==  ` unit `

` unit ` takes the unit in words or in symbolic notation as its first
argument. The value of ` space ` will be inserted between units if necessary.
Setting ` per ` to ` symbol ` will format the number with exponents (i.e. `
^(-1) ` ), ` fraction ` or ` / ` using fraction, and ` fraction-short ` or `
\\/ ` using in-line fractions.
Units in words have four possible parts:

  - ` per ` forms the inverse of the following unit.
  - A written-out prefix in the sense of SI (e.g. ` centi ` ). This is added before the unit.
  - The unit itself written out (e.g. ` gram ` ).
  - A postfix like ` squared ` . This is added after the unit and takes ` per ` into account.

The shorthand notation also has four parts:

  - ` / ` forms the inverse of the following unit.
  - A short prefix in the sense of SI (e.g. ` k ` ). This is added before the unit.
  - The short unit itself (e.g. ` g ` ).
  - An exponent like ` ^2 ` . This is added after the unit and takes ` / ` into account.

Note: Use ` u ` for micro.

The possible values of the three latter parts are loaded at runtime from `
prefixes.csv ` , ` units.csv ` , and ` postfixes.csv ` (in the library
directory). Your own units etc. can be permanently added in these files. At
runtime, they can be added using ` add-unit ` and ` add-prefix ` ,
respectively. The formats for the pre- and postfixes are:

pre-/postfix  |  shorthand  |  symbol
---|---|---
milli  |  m  |  upright(âmâ)

and for units:

unit  |  shorthand  |  symbol  |  space
---|---|---|---
meter  |  m  |  upright(âmâ)  |  true

The first column specifies the written-out word, the second one the shorthand.
These should be unique. The third column represents the string that will be
inserted as the unit symbol. For units, the last column describes whether
there should be space before the unit (possible values: ` true ` / ` false ` ,
` 1 ` , ` 0 ` ). This is mostly the cases for degrees and other angle units
(e.g. arcseconds).
If you think there are units not included that are of interest for other
users, you can create an issue or PR.

==  ` qty `

` qty ` allows a ` num ` as the first argument following the same rules. The
second argument is a unit. If ` rawunit ` is set to true, its value will be
passed on to the result (note that the string passed on will be passed to `
eval ` , so add escaped quotes ` \" ` if necessary). Otherwise, it follows the
rules of ` unit ` . The value of ` space ` will be inserted between units if
necessary, ` thousandsep ` between the thousands, and ` per ` switches between
exponents and fractions.

==  ` numrange `

` numrange ` takes two ` num ` s as the first two arguments. If they have the
same exponent, it is automatically factorized. The range symbol can be changed
with ` delimiter ` , and the space between the numbers and symbols with `
space ` .

==  ` qtyrange `

` qtyrange ` is just a combination of ` unit ` and ` range ` .

are included in MY repository only, not in the typst official one.* _ You may
find the fonts in my [ github repository in the fonts folder
](https://github.com/yanwenywan/typst-packages/tree/master/wenyuan-
campaign/0.1.0/template/fonts) , or download them yourself, or heck provide
your own fonts to your liking.



    typst init @preview/wenyuan-campaign:0.1.0


This will copy over all required fonts and comes prefilled with the standard
template so you can see how it works. To use this you need to either install
all the fonts locally or pass the folder into --font-path when compiling.

To initialise the style, do:



    #import "@preview/wenyuan-campaign:0.1.0": *

    #show: conf.with()


Very easy.

Optionally, you may set all the theme fonts from the configure function (the
defaults are shown):



    #import "@preview/wenyuan-campaign:0.1.0": *

    #show: conf.with(
        fontsize: 10pt,
        mainFont: ("TeX Gyre Bonum", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        titleFont: ("TeX Gyre Bonum", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        sansFont: ("Scaly Sans Remake", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        sansSmallcapsFont: ("Scaly Sans Caps", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        dropcapFont: "Royal Initialen"
    )


You are encouraged to copy the template files and modify them if they are not
up to your liking.

This shouldnât affect homebrew created using these fonts (just like how a painting made with a CC-BY-SA art program isnât itself CC-BY-SA) but what do I know Iâm not a lawyer.* _
  - [ KingHwa_OldSong ](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/637491623) (äº¬è¯èå®ä½) is a traditional Chinese print font used for all CJK text (if present, mostly because I need it)

0.1.0

Wrap content in custom functions with just indentation

` wrap-indent ` is a package for wrapping content in custom functions with
just indentation. This lets you avoid using trailing square brackets to wrap
content, instead you just indent it!

This system works by re-purposing Typstâs existing [ term-list
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/terms/) syntax via a custom show rule
on ` terms.item ` . We give it our custom function within [ state
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/introspection/state/) via a new ` wrap-in()
` function.

==  Hereâs a minimal example!

![A minimal
example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/wrap-
indent/0.1.0/example_page1.png)



    #set page(height: auto, width: 3.5in, margin: 0.25in)

    #import "@preview/wrap-indent:0.1.0": wrap-in, allow-wrapping

    #show terms.item: allow-wrapping

    / First --:
      A normal term list

      with multiple paragraphs

    But this text is separated


    #line(length: 100%)


    #let custom-block(content) = rect(content,
      fill: orange.lighten(90%),
      stroke: 1.5pt + gradient.linear(..color.map.flare)
    )

    / #wrap-in(custom-block):
      A *custom block* using the `wrap-in` function

      with indented text \
      over multiple lines

    And this text is _still_ separated!


And in its own code block, hereâs the required initialization:



    #import "@preview/wrap-indent:0.1.0": wrap-in, allow-wrapping

    #show terms.item: allow-wrapping


==  And hereâs a more complicated example!

![A more complicated
example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/wrap-
indent/0.1.0/example_page2.png)



    #set page(height: auto, width: 4.1in, margin: 0.25in)

    #show heading: set text(size: 0.75em)
    #show heading: set block(below: 1em)
    #set heading(numbering: "1) ")

    = Normal function call:

    // A function for wrapping some text:
    #let custom-quote(body) = rect(
      body,
      width: 100%,
      fill: luma(95%),
      stroke: (left: 2pt + luma(30%))
    )

    #custom-quote[
      Some text in a _custom quote_ spread over multiple lines
      so it actually looks like it was typed in a document.
    ]
    This text is outside the quote box


    = Wrappped function call!

    / #wrap-in(custom-quote):
      Some text in a _custom quote_ spread over multiple lines
      so it actually looks like it was typed in a document.

    This text is _still_ outside the quote box!


    = Arbitrary functions should _just work#emoji.tm;_

    / #wrap-in(x => ellipse(align(center, x),
        stroke: 3pt + gradient.conic(..color.map.rainbow)
      )):
      Some text in a _rainbow ellipse_ spread
      over multiple lines so it actually looks
      like it was typed in a document.


    = One-liners look great!

    / #wrap-in(underline): Here's one line underlined


    = Let's do some math:

    #let named-thm(name) = (content) => {
      pad(left: 2em, par(hanging-indent: -2em)[
        *Theorem* (#name) #emph(content)
      ])
    }

    / #wrap-in(named-thm("Operational Soundness")):
      If $med tack e : tau$ and $e$ reduces to $e'$
      by zero or more steps and $"Irred"(e')$,
      then $e' in "Val"$ and $med tack e' : tau$.


    = In-line styling doesn't create blocks:

    / #wrap-in(highlight):
      This text is highlighted.
    This text isn't.

    Notice how there was *no* paragraph break between the
    two sentences? This is a useful result that makes
    `wrap-indent` really flexible!

    (if you want separate blocks, use `block` in your function)


    = Does it work with nesting?

    / #wrap-in(custom-quote):
      Testing...
      / #wrap-in(align.with(center)):
        / #wrap-in(rect):
          / #wrap-in(emph):
            Signs point to yes!


    = Final thoughts

    / Note --:
      Regular term lists still work!

    / Disclaimer --:
      You may run into issues with other term list
      show rules conflicting with this rule. \
      (although set rules should be unaffected)

      If you run into issues, _let me know!_ I'd love to hear
      about it to make this package as robust as possible.


    = And

    #let big-statement(content) = {
      align(center, text(
        underline(stroke: 1.5pt, content),
        size: 32pt,
        weight: "bold",
        style: "italic",
        fill: eastern,
      ))
    }

    / #wrap-in(big-statement):
      That's a wrap!

0.2.0

A helper library for chaining lambda abstractions

A helper library for chaining lambda abstractions, imitating the ` |> ` or ` .
` operator in some functional languages.

The function ` compose ` is the ` pipe ` function in the mathematical order.
Functions suffixed with underscore have their arguments flipped.

==  Changelog

  - 0.2.0 Redesigned interface to work with typstâs ` with ` keyword.
  - 0.1.0 Initial release

==  Basic usage

It can help improve readability with nested applications to a content value,
or make the diff cleaner.



    #compose_((
      text.with(blue),
      emph,
      strong,
      underline,
      strike,
    ))[This is a very long content with a lot of words]
    // Is equivalent to
    #text(
      blue,
      emph(
        strong(
          underline(
            strike[This is a very long content with a lot of words]
          )
        )
      )
    )


You can use it for show rules just like the example above.



    #show link: compose_.with((
      text.with(fill: blue),
      emph,
      underline,
    ))
    // These two are equivalent
    #show link: text.with(fill: blue)
    #show link: emph
    #show link: underline


This can also be useful when you need to destructure lists, as it allows
creating binds that are scoped by each lambda expression.



    #let two_and_one = pipe(
      (1, 2),
      (
        ((a, b)) => (a, b, -1), // becomes a list of length three
        ((a, b, _)) => (b, a), // discard the third element and swap
      ),
    )


===  How to add

0.1.1

Anatomy of a Font. Visualise metrics.

_Anatomy of a Font_ . Visualise metrics.

Import the ` anatomy ` package:



    #import "@preview/anatomy:0.1.1": metrics


==  Display Metrics

` metrics(72pt, "EB Garamond", display: "Typewriter") ` will be rendered as
follows:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E8D08F/packages/main/packages/preview/anatomy/0.1.1/img/export-1.svg)

Additionally, a closure using ` metrics ` dictionary as parameter can be used
to layout additional elements below:



    #metrics(54pt, "ä¸é»æé«",
      display: "é»å³æå­æ©",
      use: metrics => table(
        columns: 2,
        ..metrics.pairs().flatten().map(x => [ #x ])
      )
    )


It will generate:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E8D08F/packages/main/packages/preview/anatomy/0.1.1/img/export-2.svg)

==  Remark on Hybrid Typesetting

To typeset CJK text, adopting fontâs ascender/descender as ` top-edge ` / `
bottom-edge ` makes more sense in some cases. As for most CJK fonts, the
difference between ascender and descender heights will be exact 1em.

Tested with ` metrics(54pt, "Hiragino Mincho ProN", "ãã¬ã¿ã¤ãç«¯æ«") `
:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E8D08F/packages/main/packages/preview/anatomy/0.1.1/img/export-3.svg)

Since Typst will use metrics of the font which has the largest advance height
amongst the list provided in ` set text(font: ( ... )) ` to set up top and
bottom edges of a line, leading might not work as expected in hybrid
typesetting. This issue can be solved by passing the document to `
metrics(use: metrics => { ... }) ` like this:



    #show: doc => metrics(font.size, font.main,
      // Retrieve the metrics of the CJK font
      use: metrics => {
        set text(
          font.size,
          font: ( font.latin, font.main ),
          features: ( "pkna", ),
          // Use CJK fontâs ascender/descender as top/bottom edges
          top-edge: metrics.ascender,
          bottom-edge: metrics.descender,
          // ...
        )

        doc
      }
    )

= *idwtet.md*

=  idwtet

0.3.0

Package for uniform, correct and simplified typst code demonstration.

The name ` idwtet ` stands for âI Donât Wanna Type Everything Twiceâ. It
provides a ` typst-ex ` and a ` typst-ex-code ` codeblock, which _shows*and*
executes _ typst code.

It is meant for code demonstration, e.g. when publishing a package, and
provides some niceties:

  - the code should always be correct in the examples: As the example code is used for the code block, but also for evaluation, there is no need to write it twice
  - easy configuration with simple, uniform and good look

However, there are some limitations:

  - Every code block has its own local scope and the default behaviour is that variables are not reachable from outside. A similar restriction lies on import statements. That is why, there is the ` eval-scope ` argument, which captures variables and simulates global variables. Additionally, a ` typst ` codeblock is provided for a consistent look.
  - Locality can be displayed to the users by automatically wrapping code in ` typst-ex-code ` , but ` typst-ex ` does not provide such functionality. It might thus be difficult for users to understand code examples this way.
  - The page width has to be defined in absolute terms. It is quite nice, for a showcase, to take the least possible space, but tracking the widths of all boxes and then setting the page width accordingly is not (yet) possible.

==  Usage

Only one function is defined, ` init(body, bcolor: luma(210), inset: 5pt,
border: 2pt, radius: 2pt, content-font: "linux libertine", code-font-size:
9pt, content-font-size: 11pt, code-return-box: true, wrap-code: false, eval-
scope: (:), escape-bracket: "%") ` , which is supposed to be used with a show
rule.

Then raw codeblocks (with ` block=true ` ) of the languages ` typst ` , `
typst-ex ` , ` typst-code ` and ` typst-ex-code ` are modified. The main
feature of this package are ` typst-ex ` and ` typst-ex-code ` . The ` typst `
and ` typst-code ` blocks do not evaluate anything, but their design fits that
of the others.

The parameters of ` init ` are:

  - ` body ` : for usage with show rule, hence the whole document.
  - ` bcolor ` : the background- (and border-) color of the blocks
  - ` inset ` : inset param of code and content blocks, should be â¥ 2pt
  - ` border ` : border thickness
  - ` radius ` : block radius
  - ` content-font ` : The font used in the previewed content / result.
  - ` code-font-size ` : The fontsize used in the code blocks.
  - ` content-font-size ` : The fontsize used in the preview content / result.
  - ` code-return-box ` : If to show the code return type on ` typst-ex-code ` blocks.
  - ` wrap-code ` : If to wrap the code in ` #{ ` and ` } ` , to symbolize local scope.
  - ` eval-scope ` : A dictionary with the keys as the variable names and the values as another dictionary with keys ` value ` and ` code ` , both of these are optional. The former has the defined value, the latter the code recreate the variable, for usage in the code blocks.
  - ` escape-bracket ` : The text to wrap a variable with, to access the ` code ` part of a ` eval-scope ` variable.

==  Hiding code and replacements

There are currently two methods to change the code:

  - use the ` eval-scope ` argument from the ` init ` function. There is a ` code ` field in the dictionaries, which enables the usage of the key escaped in ` escape-bracket ` to be replaced in the codeblock code half and to be removed in the codeblock result half, as the value is given via scope. Take a look at the example below, where ` %ouset% ` is used this way.
  - use the ` ENDHIDDEN ` feature. When escaped in ` escape-bracket ` , everything above the statement is removed from the codeblock code half BUT everything (without the ` ENDHIDDEN ` statement) is evaluated. Take a look at the example in the examples folder.

==  Example



    #set page(margin: 0.5cm, width: 14cm, height: auto)
    #import "@preview/idwtet:0.1.0"
    #show: idwtet.init.with(eval-scope: (
      ouset: (
        value: {import "@preview/ouset:0.1.1": ouset; ouset},
        code: "#import \"@preview/ouset:0.1.1\": ouset"
      )
    ))

    == ouset package #text(gray)[(v0.1.1)]
    ```typst-ex
    %ouset%
    $
    "Expression 1" ouset(&, <==>, "Theorem 1") "Expression 2"\
                   ouset(&, ==>,, "Theorem 7") "Expression 3"
    $
    ```
    Or something like
    ```typst-ex-code
    let a = range(10)
    a
    ```


Further examples are given in the repo example folder.

= *down.md*

=  down

0.1.0

Pass down arguments of `sum`, `integral`, etc. to the next line, which can
generate shorthand to present reusable segments.

Pass down arguments of ` sum ` , ` integral ` , etc. to the next line, which
can generate shorthand to present reusable segments. While writing long step-
by-step equations, only certain parts of a line change. ` down ` leverages
Typstâs ` context ` (from version 0.11.0) to help relieve the pressure of
writing long and repetitive formulae.

Import the package:



    #import "@preview/down:0.1.0": *


==  Usage

Create new contexts by using camel-case commands, such as ` Limit(x, +0) ` .
Retrieve the contextual with ` cLimit ` .

  - ` Limit(x, c) ` and ` cLimit ` :



    $
    Lim(x, +0) x ln(sin x)
      = cLim ln(sin x) / x^(-1)
      = cLim x / (sin x) cos x
      = 0
    $


  - ` Sum(index, lower, upper) ` and ` cSum ` :



    $
    Sum(n, 0, oo) 1 / sqrt(n + 1)
      = Sum(#none, 0, #none) 1 / sqrt(n)
      = cSum 1 / n^(1 / 2)
    $


  - ` Integral(lower, upper, f, dif: [x]) ` , ` cIntegral(f) ` and ` cIntegrated(f) ` :



    $
    Integral(0, pi / 3, sqrt(1 + tan^2 x))
      = cIntegral(1 / (cos x))
      = cIntegrated(ln (cos x / 2 + sin x / 2) / (cos x / 2 - sin x / 2))
      = ln (2 + sqrt(3))
    $

_Note, that this package is in beta and may still be undergoing breaking
changes. As new features like data types and scoped functions will be added to
Typst, this package will be adapted to profit from the new paradigms._

_Meanwhile, we suggest importing everything from the package in a local scope
to avoid polluting the global namespace (see example below)._

==  Basic usage

The function ` quantum-circuit() ` takes any number of positional gates and
works somewhat similarly to the built-int Typst functions ` table() ` or `
grid() ` . A variety of different gate and instruction commands are available
for adding elements and integers can be used to produce any number of empty
cells (filled with the current wire style). A new wire is started by adding a
` [\ ] ` item.



    #{
      import "@preview/quill:0.5.0": *

      quantum-circuit(
        lstick($|0âª$), $H$, ctrl(1), rstick($(|00âª+|11âª)/â2$, n: 2), [\ ],
        lstick($|0âª$), 1, targ(), 1
      )
    }


![Bell circuit](https://github.com/user-
attachments/assets/53d0c581-ab62-44e3-abf5-5497993d7aba)

Plain quantum gates â such as a Hadamard gate â can be written with the
shorthand notation ` $H$ ` instead of the more lengthy ` gate($H$) ` . The
latter offers more options, however.

Refer to the [ user guide ](https://github.com/Mc-
Zen/quill/releases/download/v0.5.0/quill-guide.pdf) for a full documentation
of this package. You can also look up the documentation of any function by
calling the help module, e.g., ` help("gate") ` in order to print the
signature and description of the ` gate ` command, just where you are
currently typing (powered by [ tidy ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/tidy) ).

==  Cheat Sheet

Instead of listing every featured gate (as is done in the [ user guide
](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/quill/releases/download/v0.5.0/quill-guide.pdf) ),
this gallery quickly showcases a large selection of possible gates and
decorations that can be added to any quantum circuit.

==  Tequila

_Tequila_ is a submodule that adds a completely different way of building
circuits.



    #import "@preview/quill:0.5.0" as quill: tequila as tq

    #quill.quantum-circuit(
      ..tq.build(
        tq.h(0),
        tq.cx(0, 1),
        tq.cx(0, 2),
      ),
      quill.gategroup(x: 2, y: 0, 3, 2)
    )


This is similar to how _QASM_ and _Qiskit_ work: gates are successively
applied to the circuit which is then layed out automatically by packing gates
as tightly as possible. We start by calling the ` tq.build() ` function and
filling it with quantum operations. This returns a collection of gates which
we expand into the circuit with the ` .. ` syntax. Now, we still have the
option to add annotations, groups, slices, or even more gates via manual
placement.

The syntax works analog to Qiskit. Available gates are ` x ` , ` y ` , ` z ` ,
` h ` , ` s ` , ` sdg ` , ` sx ` , ` sxdg ` , ` t ` , ` tdg ` , ` p ` , ` rx `
, ` ry ` , ` rz ` , ` u ` , ` cx ` , ` cz ` , and ` swap ` . With ` barrier `
, an invisible barrier can be inserted to prevent gates on different qubits to
be packed tightly. Finally, with ` tq.gate ` and ` tq.mqgate ` , a generic
gate can be created. These two accept the same styling arguments as the normal
` gate ` (or ` mqgate ` ).

Also like Qiskit, all qubit arguments support ranges, e.g., ` tq.h(range(5)) `
adds a Hadamard gate on the first five qubits and ` tq.cx((0, 1), (1, 2)) `
adds two CX gates: one from qubit 0 to 1 and one from qubit 1 to 2.

With Tequila, it is easy to build templates for quantum circuits and to
compose circuits of various building blocks. For this purpose, ` tq.build() `
and the built-in templates all feature optional ` x ` and ` y ` arguments to
allow placing a subcircuit at an arbitrary position of the circuit. As an
example, Tequila provides a ` tq.graph-state() ` template for quickly drawing
graph state preparation circuits.

The following example demonstrates how to compose multiple subcircuits.



    #import tequila as tq

    #quantum-circuit(
      ..tq.graph-state((0, 1), (1, 2)),
      ..tq.build(y: 3,
          tq.p($pi$, 0),
          tq.cx(0, (1, 2)),
        ),
      ..tq.graph-state(x: 6, y: 2, invert: true, (0, 1), (0, 2)),
      gategroup(x: 1, 3, 3),
      gategroup(x: 1, y: 3, 3, 3),
      gategroup(x: 6, y: 2, 3, 3),
      slice(x: 5)
    )

==  Tests

This package uses [ typst-test ](https://github.com/tingerrr/typst-test/) for
running [ tests ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/quill/tree/v0.5.0/tests/) .

==  Changelog

===  v0.5.0

  - Added support for multi-controlled gates with Tequila.
  - Switched to using ` context ` instead of the now deprecated ` style() ` for measurement. Note: Starting with this version, Typst 0.11.0 or higher is required.

===  v0.4.0

  - Alternative model for creating and composing circuits: [ Tequila ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/quill/0.5.0/#tequila) .

===  v0.3.0

  - New features
    - Enable manual placement of gates, ` gate($X$, x: 3, y: 1) ` , similar to built-in ` table() ` in addition to automatic placement. This works for most elements, not only gates.
    - Add parameter ` pad ` to ` lstick() ` and ` rstick() ` .
    - Add parameter ` fill-wires ` to ` quantum-circuit() ` . All wires are filled unto the end (determined by the longest wire) by default (breaking change â ï¸). This behavior can be reverted by setting ` fill-wires: false ` .
    - ` gategroup() ` ` slice() ` and ` annotate() ` can now be placed above or below the circuit with ` z: "above" ` and ` z: "below" ` .
    - ` help() ` command for quickly displaying the documentation of a given function, e.g., ` help("gate") ` . Powered by [ tidy ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/tidy) .
  - Improvements:
    - Complete rework of circuit layout implementation
      - allows transparent gates since wires are not drawn through gates anymore. The default fill is now ` auto ` and using ` none ` sets the background to transparent.
      - ` midstick ` is now transparent by default.
    - ` setwire() ` can now be used to override only partial wire settings, such as wire color ` setwire(1, stroke: blue) ` , width ` setwire(1, stroke: 1pt) ` or wire distance, all separately. Before, some settings were reset.
  - Fixes:
    - Fixed ` lstick ` / ` rstick ` when equation numbering is turned on.
  - Removed:
    - The already deprecated ` scale-factor ` (use ` scale ` instead)

===  v0.2.1

  - Improvements:
    - Add ` fill ` parameter to ` midstick() ` .
    - Add ` bend ` parameter to ` permute() ` .
    - Add ` separation ` parameter to ` permute() ` .
  - Fixes:
    - With Typst 0.11.0, ` scale() ` now takes into account outer alignment. This broke the positioning of centered/right-aligned circuits, e.g., ones put into a ` figure() ` .
    - Change wires to be drawn all through ` ctrl() ` , making it consistent to ` swap() ` and ` targ() ` .

===  v0.2.0

  - New features:
    - Add arbitrary labels to any ` gate ` (also derived gates such as ` meter ` , ` ctrl ` , â¦), ` gategroup ` or ` slice ` that can be anchored to any of the nine 2d alignments.
    - Add optional gate inputs and outputs for multi-qubit gates (see gallery).
    - Implicit gates (breaking change â ï¸): a content item automatically becomes a gate, so you can just type ` $H$ ` instead of ` gate($H$) ` (of course, the ` gate() ` function is still important in order to use the many available options).
  - Other breaking changes â ï¸:
    - ` slice() ` has no ` dx ` and ` dy ` parameters anymore. Instead, labels are handled through ` label ` exactly as in ` gate() ` . Also the ` wires ` parameter is replaced with ` n ` for consistency with other multi-qubit gates.
    - Swap order of row and column parameters in ` annotate() ` to make it consistent with built-in Typst functions.
  - Improvements:
    - Improve layout (allow row/column spacing and min lengths to be specified in em-lengths).
    - Automatic bounds computation, even for labels.
    - Improve meter (allow multi-qubit gate meters and respect global (per-circuit) gate padding).d
  - Fixes:
    - ` lstick ` / ` rstick ` braces broke with Typst 0.7.0.
    - ` lstick ` / ` rstick ` bounds.
  - Documentation
    - Add section on creating custom gates.
    - Add section on using labels.
    - Explain usage of ` slice() ` and ` gategroup() ` .

= *lasaveur.md*

=  lasaveur

0.1.3

Porting vim-latex's math shorthands to Typst. An accommendating vim syntax
file is provided in the repo.

This is a Typst package for speedy mathematical input, inspired by [ vim-latex
](https://github.com/vim-latex/vim-latex) . This project is named after my Vim
plugin [ vimtex-lasaveur ](https://github.com/yangwenbo99/vimtex-lasaveur) ,
which ports the operations in vim-latex to [ vimtex
](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) .

==  Usages in Typst

Either use the file released in âReleasesâ or import using the following
command:



    #import "@preview/lasaveur:0.1.3": *


This script generates a Typst library that defines shorthand commands for
various mathematical symbols and functions. Hereâs an overview of what it
provides and how a user can use it:

  1. Mathematical Functions:
     - Usage: ` f<key>(argument) `
     - Examples: ` fh(x) ` for hat, ` ft(x) ` for tilde, ` f2(x) ` for square root
  2. Font Styles:
     - Usage: ` f<key>(argument) `
     - Examples: ` fb(x) ` for bold, ` fbb(x) ` for blackboard bold, ` fca(x) ` for calligraphic
  3. Greek Letters:
     - Usage: ` k<key> `
     - Examples: ` ka ` for Î± (alpha), ` kb ` for Î² (beta), ` kG ` for Î (capital Gamma)
  4. Common Mathematical Symbols:
     - Usage: ` g<key> `
     - Examples: ` g8 ` for â (infinity), ` gU ` for âª (union), ` gI ` for â© (intersection)
  5. LaTeX-compatible Symbols:
     - Usage: Direct LaTeX command names
     - Examples: ` partial ` for â, ` infty ` for â, ` cdot ` for â
  6. Arrows:
     - Usage: ` ar.<key> `
     - Examples: ` ar.l ` for â, ` ar.r ` for â, ` ar.lr ` for â

Users can employ these shorthands in their Typst documents to quickly input
mathematical symbols and functions. The exact prefix for each category (like `
f ` for functions or ` k ` for Greek letters) can be customized using command-
line arguments when running the script.

For instance, in a Typst document, after importing the generated library, a
user could write:



    $fh(x) + ka + g8 + ar.r$


This would produce: xÌ + Î± + â + â

The script provides a wide range of symbols covering most common mathematical
notations, making it easier and faster to type complex mathematical
expressions in Typst â especially for users migrating from vim-latex.

==  Accompanying Vim Syntax File

The syntax file provides more advanced and correct concealing for both
Typstâs built-in math syntax and the lasaveur shorthands. Download the
syntax file from the âReleasesâ section and place it in your `
~/.vim/after/syntax/ ` directory. The ` syntax.vim ` file in the repo is
supposed to be used by the generation script and it _will not work_ if
directly sourced in Vim.

=  starter-journal-article

0.3.1

A starter template for journal articles.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=starter-journal-article&version=0.3.1)

This package provides a template for writing journal articles to organise
authors, institutions, and information of corresponding authors.

==  Usage

Run the following command to use this template



    typst init @preview/starter-journal-article


==  Documentation

===  ` article `

The template for creating journal articles. It needs the following arguments.

Arguments:

  - ` title ` : The title of this article. Default: ` "Article Title" ` .
  - ` authors ` : A dictionary of authors. Dictionary keys are authorsâ names. Dictionary values are meta data of every author, including label(s) of affiliation(s), email, contact address, or a self-defined name (to avoid name conflicts). The label(s) of affiliation(s) must be those claimed in the argument ` affiliations ` . Once the email or address exists, the author(s) will be labelled as the corresponding author(s), and their address will show in footnotes. Function ` author-meta() ` is useful in creating information for each author. Default: ` ("Author Name": author-meta("affiliation-label")) ` .
  - ` affiliations ` : A dictionary of affiliation. Dictionary keys are affiliationsâ labels. These labels show be constent with those used in authorsâ meta data. Dictionary values are addresses of every affiliation. Default: ` ("affiliation-label": "Affiliation address") ` .
  - ` abstract ` : The paperâs abstract. Default: ` [] ` .
  - ` keywords ` : The paperâs keywords. Default: ` [] ` .
  - ` bib ` : The bibliography. Accept value from the built-in ` bibliography ` function. Default: ` none ` .
  - ` template ` : Templates for the following parts. Please see below for more informations
    - ` title: (title) => {} ` : how to show the title of this article.
    - ` author-info: (authors, affiliations) => {} ` : how to show each authorâs information.
    - ` abstract: (abstract, keywords) => {} ` : how to show the abstract and keywords.
    - ` bibliography: (bib) => {} ` : how to show the bibliography.
    - ` body: (body) => {} ` : how to show main text.

===  ` author-meta `

A helper to create meta information for an author.

Arguments:

  - ` ..affiliation ` : Capture the positioned arguments as label(s) of affiliation(s). Mandatory.
  - ` email ` : The email address of the author. Default: ` none ` .
  - ` alias ` : The display name of the author. Default: ` none ` .
  - ` address ` : The address of the author. Default: ` none ` .
  - ` cofirst ` : Whether the author is the co-first author. Default: ` false ` .

==  Default templates

The following code shows how the default templates are defined. You can
override any of the by setting the ` template ` argument in the ` article() `
function to customise the template.



    #let default-title(title) = {
      show: block.with(width: 100%)
      set align(center)
      set text(size: 1.75em, weight: "bold")
      title
    }

    #let default-author(author) = {
      text(author.name)
      super(author.insts.map(it => str(it)).join(","))
      if author.corresponding {
        footnote[
          Corresponding author. Address: #author.address.
          #if author.email != none {
            [Email: #underline(author.email).]
          }
        ]
      }
      if author.cofirst == "thefirst" {
        footnote("cofirst-author-mark")
      } else if author.cofirst == "cofirst" {
        locate(loc => query(footnote.where(body: [cofirst-author-mark]), loc).last())

template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/mantys-0.1.4-small.webp)

=  mantys

0.1.4

Helpers to build manuals for Typst packages.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=mantys&version=0.1.4)

> *MAN* uals for *TY* p *S* t

Template for documenting [ typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) packages
and templates.

==  Usage

Just import the package at the beginning of your manual:



    #import "@preview/mantys:0.1.4": *


Mantys supports *Typst 0.11.0* and newer.

==  Writing basics

A basic template for a manual could look like this:



    #import "@local/mantys:0.1.4": *

    #import "your-package.typ"

    #show: mantys.with(
    	name:		"your-package-name",
    	title: 		[A title for the manual],
    	subtitle: 	[A subtitle for the manual],
    	info:		[A short descriptive text for the package.],
    	authors:	"Your Name",
    	url:		"https://github.com/repository/url",
    	version:	"0.0.1",
    	date:		"date-of-release",
    	abstract: 	[
    		A few paragraphs of text to describe the package.
    	],

    	example-imports: (your-package: your-package)
    )

    // end of preamble

    # About
    #lorem(50)

    # Usage
    #lorem(50)

    # Available commands
    #lorem(50)



Use ` #command(name, ..args)[description] ` to describe commands and `
#argument(name, ...)[description] ` for arguments:



    #command("headline", arg[color], arg(size:1.8em), sarg[other-args], barg[body])[
    	Renders a prominent headline using #doc("meta/heading").

    	#argument("color", type:"color")[
        The color of the headline will be used as the background of a #doc("layout/block") element containing the headline.
      ]
      #argument("size", default:1.8em)[
        The text size for the headline.
      ]
      #argument("sarg", is-sink:true)[
        Other options will get passed directly to #doc("meta/heading").
      ]
      #argument("body", type:"content")[
        The text for the headline.
      ]

      The headline is shown as a prominent colored block to highlight important news articles in the newsletter:

      #example[```
      #headline(blue, size: 2em, level: 3)[
        #lorem(8)
      ]
      ```]
    ]


The result might look something like this:

==  How to Compile

This project contains an example setup that splits individual chapters into
different files.
This can cause problems when using references etc.
These problems can be avoided by following these steps:

  - Make sure to always compile your ` main.typ ` file which includes all of your chapters for references to work correctly.
  - VSCode:
    - Install the [ Tinymist Typst ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extension.
    - Make sure to start the ` PDF ` or ` Live Preview ` only from within your ` main.typ ` file.
    - If problems occur it usually helps to close the preview and restart it from your ` main.typ ` file.

==  Examples

Examples can be found inside of the [ examples
](https://github.com/LasseRosenow/HAW-Hamburg-Typst-
Template/tree/main/examples) directory

  - For Bachelor theses see: [ Bachelor thesis example ](https://github.com/LasseRosenow/HAW-Hamburg-Typst-Template/tree/main/examples/bachelor-thesis)
  - For Master theses see: [ Master thesis example ](https://github.com/LasseRosenow/HAW-Hamburg-Typst-Template/tree/main/examples/master-thesis)

==  Acronyms

This template provides functions to reference acronyms in the text. To use
these functions, you need to define the acronyms in the ` acronyms ` attribute
of the template. The acronyms referenced with the functions below will be
linked to their definition in the list of acronyms.

===  Functions

This template provides the following functions to reference acronyms:

` acr ` : Reference an acronym in the text (e.g. ` acr("API") ` -> `
Application Programming Interface (API) ` or ` API ` )

` acrpl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in plural form (e.g. `
acrpl("API") ` -> ` Application Programming Interfaces (API) ` or ` APIs ` )

` acrs ` : Reference an acronym in the text in short form (e.g. ` acrs("API")
` -> ` API ` )

` acrspl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in short form in plural form
(e.g. ` acrpl("API") ` -> ` APIs ` )

` acrl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in long form (e.g. ` acrl("API") `
-> ` Application Programming Interface ` )

` acrlpl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in long form in plural form
(e.g. ` acrlpl("API") ` -> ` Application Programming Interfaces ` )

` acrf ` : Reference an acronym in the text in full form (e.g. ` acrf("API") `
-> ` Application Programming Interface (API) ` )

` acrfpl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in full form in plural form
(e.g. ` acrfpl("API") ` -> ` Application Programming Interfaces (API) ` )

===  Definition

To define acronyms use a dictionary and pass it to the acronyms attribute of
the template. The dictionary should contain the acronyms as keys and their
long forms as values.



    #let acronyms = (
      API: "Application Programming Interface",
      HTTP: "Hypertext Transfer Protocol",
      REST: "Representational State Transfer",
    )


To define the plural form of an acronym use a array as value with the first
element being the singular form and the second element being the plural form.
If you donât define the plural form, the template will automatically add an
âsâ to the singular form.



    #let acronyms = (
      API: ("Application Programming Interface", "Application Programming Interfaces"),
      HTTP: ("Hypertext Transfer Protocol", "Hypertext Transfer Protocols"),
      REST: ("Representational State Transfer", "Representational State Transfers"),
    )


==  Glossary

Similar to the acronyms, this template provides a function to reference
glossary terms in the text. To use the function, you need to define the
glossary terms in the ` glossary ` attribute of the template. The glossary
terms referenced with the function below will be linked to their definition in
the list of glossary terms.

===  Reference

` gls ` : Reference a glossary term in the text (e.g. ` gls("Vulnerability") `
-> link to the definition of âVulnerabilityâ in the glossary)

===  Definition

The definition works analogously to the acronyms. Define the glossary terms in
a dictionary and pass it to the glossary attribute of the template. The
dictionary should contain the glossary terms as keys and their definitions as
values.



    #let glossary = (
      Vulnerability: "A Vulnerability is a flaw in a computer system that weakens the overall security of the system.",
      Patch: "A patch is data that is intended to be used to modify an existing software resource such as a program or a file, often to fix bugs and security vulnerabilities.",
      Exploit: "An exploit is a method or piece of code that takes advantage of vulnerabilities in software, applications, networks, operating systems, or hardware, typically for malicious purposes.",
    )

Convenient Rust-like string formatting in Typst

A Typst library that brings convenient string formatting and interpolation
through the ` strfmt ` function. Its syntax is taken directly from Rustâs `
format! ` syntax, so feel free to read its page for more information ( [
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/ ](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/) );
however, this README should have enough information and examples for all
expected uses of the library. Only a few things arenât supported from the
Rust syntax, such as the ` p ` (pointer) format type, or the ` .* ` precision
specifier.

A few extras (beyond the Rust-like syntax) will be added over time, though
(feel free to drop suggestions at the repository: [
https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-oxifmt ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-
oxifmt) ). The first âextraâ so far is the ` fmt-decimal-separator:
"string" ` parameter, which lets you customize the decimal separator for
decimal numbers (floats) inserted into strings. E.g. ` strfmt("Result: {}",
5.8, fmt-decimal-separator: ",") ` will return the string ` "Result: 5,8" `
(comma instead of dot). See more below.

==  Usage

You can use this library through Typstâs package manager (for Typst
v0.6.0+):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt


For older Typst versions, download the ` oxifmt.typ ` file either from
Releases or directly from the repository. Then, move it to your projectâs
folder, and write at the top of your Typst file(s):



    #import "oxifmt.typ": strfmt


Doing the above will give you access to the main function provided by this
library ( ` strfmt ` ), which accepts a format string, followed by zero or
more replacements to insert in that string (according to ` {...} ` formats
inserted in that string), an optional ` fmt-decimal-separator ` parameter, and
returns the formatted string, as described below.

Its syntax is almost identical to Rustâs ` format! ` (as specified here: [
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/ ](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/) ).
You can escape formats by duplicating braces ( ` {{ ` and ` }} ` become ` { `
and ` } ` ). Hereâs an example (see more examples in the file `
tests/strfmt-tests.typ ` ):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("I'm {}. I have {num} cars. I'm {0}. {} is {{cool}}.", "John", "Carl", num: 10)
    #assert.eq(s, "I'm John. I have 10 cars. I'm John. Carl is {cool}.")


Note that ` {} ` extracts positional arguments after the string sequentially
(the first ` {} ` extracts the first one, the second ` {} ` extracts the
second one, and so on), while ` {0} ` , ` {1} ` , etc. will always extract the
first, the second etc. positional arguments after the string. Additionally, `
{bananas} ` will extract the named argument âbananasâ.

===  Formatting options

You can use ` {:spec} ` to customize your output. See the Rust docs linked
above for more info, but a summary is below.

(You may also want to check out the examples at [ Examples
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oxifmt/0.2.1/#examples)
.)

  - Adding a ` ? ` at the end of ` spec ` (that is, writing e.g. ` {0:?} ` ) will call ` repr() ` to stringify your argument, instead of ` str() ` . Note that this only has an effect if your argument is a string, an integer, a float or a ` label() ` / ` <label> ` \- for all other types (such as booleans or elements), ` repr() ` is always called (as ` str() ` is unsupported for those).
    - For strings, ` ? ` (and thus ` repr() ` ) has the effect of printing them with double quotes. For floats, this ensures a ` .0 ` appears after it, even if it doesnât have decimal digits. For integers, this doesnât change anything. Finally, for labels, the ` <label> ` (with ` ? ` ) is printed as ` <label> ` instead of ` label ` .
    - *TIP:* Prefer to always use ` ? ` when youâre inserting something that isnât a string, number or label, in order to ensure consistent results even if the library eventually changes the non- ` ? ` representation.
  - After the ` : ` , add e.g. ` _<8 ` to align the string to the left, padding it with as many ` _ ` s as necessary for it to be at least ` 8 ` characters long (for example). Replace ` < ` by ` > ` for right alignment, or ` ^ ` for center alignment. (If the ` _ ` is omitted, it defaults to â â (aligns with spaces).)
    - If you prefer to specify the minimum width (the ` 8 ` there) as a separate argument to ` strfmt ` instead, you can specify ` argument$ ` in place of the width, which will extract it from the integer at ` argument ` . For example, ` _^3$ ` will center align the output with ` _ ` s, where the minimum width desired is specified by the fourth positional argument (index ` 3 ` ), as an integer. This means that a call such as ` strfmt("{:_^3$}", 1, 2, 3, 4) ` would produce ` "__1__" ` , as ` 3$ ` would evaluate to ` 4 ` (the value at the fourth positional argument/index ` 3 ` ). Similarly, ` named$ ` would take the width from the argument with name ` named ` , if it is an integer (otherwise, error).
  - *For numbers:*
    - Specify ` + ` after the ` : ` to ensure zero or positive numbers are prefixed with ` + ` before them (instead of having no sign). ` - ` is also accepted but ignored (negative numbers always specify their sign anyways).
    - Use something like ` :09 ` to add zeroes to the left of the number until it has at least 9 digits / characters.
      - The ` 9 ` here is also a width, so the same comment from before applies (you can add ` $ ` to take it from an argument to the ` strfmt ` function).
    - Use ` :.5 ` to ensure your float is represented with 5 decimal digits of precision (zeroes are added to the right if needed; otherwise, it is rounded, *not truncated* ).
      - Note that floating point inaccuracies can be sometimes observed here, which is an unfortunate current limitation.
      - Similarly to ` width ` , the precision can also be specified via an argument with the ` $ ` syntax: ` .5$ ` will take the precision from the integer at argument number 5 (the sixth one), while ` .test$ ` will take it from the argument named ` test ` .
    - *Integers only:* Add ` x ` (lowercase hex) or ` X ` (uppercase) at the end of the ` spec ` to convert the number to hexadecimal. Also, ` b ` will convert it to binary, while ` o ` will convert to octal.
      - Specify a hashtag, e.g. ` #x ` or ` #b ` , to prepend the corresponding base prefix to the base-converted number, e.g. ` 0xABC ` instead of ` ABC ` .
    - Add ` e ` or ` E ` at the end of the ` spec ` to ensure the number is represented in scientific notation (with ` e ` or ` E ` as the exponent separator, respectively).
    - For decimal numbers (floats), you can specify ` fmt-decimal-separator: "," ` to ` strfmt ` to have the decimal separator be a comma instead of a dot, for example.
      - To have this be the default, you can alias ` strfmt ` , such as using ` #let strfmt = strfmt.with(fmt-decimal-separator: ",") ` .
    - Number spec arguments (such as ` .5 ` ) are ignored when the argument is not a number, but e.g. a string, even if it looks like a number (such as ` "5" ` ).
  - Note that all spec arguments above *have to be specified in order* \- if you mix up the order, it wonât work properly!
    - Check the grammar below for the proper order, but, in summary: fill (character) with align ( ` < ` , ` > ` or ` ^ ` ) -> sign ( ` + ` or ` - ` ) -> ` # ` -> ` 0 ` (for 0 left-padding of numbers) -> width (e.g. ` 8 ` from ` 08 ` or ` 9 ` from ` -<9 ` ) -> ` .precision ` -> spec type ( ` ? ` , ` x ` , ` X ` , ` b ` , ` o ` , ` e ` , ` E ` )).

Some examples:



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s1 = strfmt("{0:?}, {test:+012e}, {1:-<#8x}", "hi", -74, test: 569.4)
    #assert.eq(s1, "\"hi\", +00005.694e2, -0x4a---")

    #let s2 = strfmt("{:_>+11.5}", 59.4)
    #assert.eq(s2, "__+59.40000")

    #let s3 = strfmt("Dict: {:!<10?}", (a: 5))
    #assert.eq(s3, "Dict: (a: 5)!!!!")


===  Examples

  - *Inserting labels, text and numbers into strings:*



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("First: {}, Second: {}, Fourth: {3}, Banana: {banana} (brackets: {{escaped}})", 1, 2.1, 3, label("four"), banana: "Banana!!")
    #assert.eq(s, "First: 1, Second: 2.1, Fourth: four, Banana: Banana!! (brackets: {escaped})")


  - *Forcing` repr() ` with ` {:?} ` * (which adds quotes around strings, and other things - basically represents a Typst value):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("The value is: {:?} | Also the label is {:?}", "something", label("label"))
    #assert.eq(s, "The value is: \"something\" | Also the label is <label>")


  - *Inserting other types than numbers and strings* (for now, they will always use ` repr() ` , even without ` {...:?} ` , although that is more explicit):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Values: {:?}, {1:?}, {stuff:?}", (test: 500), ("a", 5.1), stuff: [a])
    #assert.eq(s, "Values: (test: 500), (\"a\", 5.1), [a]")


  - *Padding to a certain width with characters:* Use ` {:x<8} ` , where ` x ` is the *character to pad with* (e.g. space or ` _ ` , but can be anything), ` < ` is the *alignment of the original text* relative to the padding (can be ` < ` for left aligned (padding goes to the right), ` > ` for right aligned (padded to its left) and ` ^ ` for center aligned (padded at both left and right)), and ` 8 ` is the *desired total width* (padding will add enough characters to reach this width; if the replacement string already has this width, no padding will be added):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Left5 {:-<5}, Right6 {:=>6}, Center10 {centered: ^10?}, Left3 {tleft:_<3}", "xx", 539, tleft: "okay", centered: [a])
    #assert.eq(s, "Left5 xx---, Right6 ===539, Center10     [a]    , Left3 okay")
    // note how 'okay' didn't suffer any padding at all (it already had at least the desired total width).


  - *Padding numbers with zeroes to the left:* Itâs a similar functionality to the above, however you write ` {:08} ` for 8 characters (for instance) - note that any characters in the numberâs representation matter for width (including sign, dot and decimal part):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Left-padded7 numbers: {:07} {:07} {:07} {3:07}", 123, -344, 44224059, 45.32)
    #assert.eq(s, "Left-padded7 numbers: 0000123 -000344 44224059 0045.32")


  - *Defining padding-to width using parameters, not literals:* If you want the desired replacement width (the ` 8 ` in ` {:08} ` or ` {: ^8} ` ) to be passed via parameter (instead of being hardcoded into the format string), you can specify ` parameter$ ` in place of the width, e.g. ` {:02$} ` to take it from the third positional parameter, or ` {:a>banana$} ` to take it from the parameter named ` banana ` \- note that the chosen parameter *must be an integer* (desired total width):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Padding depending on parameter: {0:02$} and {0:a>banana$}", 432, 0, 5, banana: 9)
    #assert.eq(s, "Padding depending on parameter: 00432 aaaaaa432")  // widths 5 and 9


  - *Displaying` + ` on positive numbers: * Just add a ` + ` at the âbeginningâ, i.e., before the ` #0 ` (if either is there), or after the custom fill and align (if itâs there and not ` 0 ` \- see [ Grammar ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oxifmt/0.2.1/#grammar) for the exact positioning), like so:



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Some numbers: {:+} {:+08}; With fill and align: {:_<+8}; Negative (no-op): {neg:+}", 123, 456, 4444, neg: -435)
    #assert.eq(s, "Some numbers: +123 +0000456; With fill and align: +4444___; Negative (no-op): -435")



  - *Converting numbers to bases 2, 8 and 16:* Use one of the following specifier types (i.e., characters which always go at the very end of the format): ` b ` (binary), ` o ` (octal), ` x ` (lowercase hexadecimal) or ` X ` (uppercase hexadecimal). You can also add a ` # ` between ` + ` and ` 0 ` (see the exact position at the [ Grammar ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oxifmt/0.2.1/#grammar) ) to display a *base prefix* before the number (i.e. ` 0b ` for binary, ` 0o ` for octal and ` 0x ` for hexadecimal):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Bases (10, 2, 8, 16(l), 16(U):) {0} {0:b} {0:o} {0:x} {0:X} | W/ prefixes and modifiers: {0:#b} {0:+#09o} {0:_>+#9X}", 124)
    #assert.eq(s, "Bases (10, 2, 8, 16(l), 16(U):) 124 1111100 174 7c 7C | W/ prefixes and modifiers: 0b1111100 +0o000174 ____+0x7C")


  - *Picking float precision (right-extending with zeroes):* Add, at the end of the format (just before the spec type (such as ` ? ` ), if thereâs any), either ` .precision ` (hardcoded, e.g. ` .8 ` for 8 decimal digits) or ` .parameter$ ` (taking the precision value from the specified parameter, like with ` width ` ):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("{0:.8} {0:.2$} {0:.potato$}", 1.234, 0, 2, potato: 5)
    #assert.eq(s, "1.23400000 1.23 1.23400")


  - *Scientific notation:* Use ` e ` (lowercase) or ` E ` (uppercase) as specifier types (can be combined with precision):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("{0:e} {0:E} {0:+.9e} | {1:e} | {2:.4E}", 124.2312, 50, -0.02)
    #assert.eq(s, "1.242312e2 1.242312E2 +1.242312000e2 | 5e1 | -2.0000E-2")


  - *Customizing the decimal separator on floats:* Just specify ` fmt-decimal-separator: "," ` (comma as an example):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("{0} {0:.6} {0:.5e}", 1.432, fmt-decimal-separator: ",")
    #assert.eq(s, "1,432 1,432000 1,43200e0")


===  Grammar

Hereâs the grammar specification for valid format ` spec ` s (in `
{name:spec} ` ), which is basically Rustâs format:



    format_spec := [[fill]align][sign]['#']['0'][width]['.' precision]type
    fill := character
    align := '<' | '^' | '>'
    sign := '+' | '-'
    width := count
    precision := count | '*'
    type := '' | '?' | 'x?' | 'X?' | identifier
    count := parameter | integer
    parameter := argument '$'


Note, however, that precision of type ` .* ` is not supported yet and will
raise an error.

==  Changelog

===  v0.2.1

  - Fixed formatting of UTF-8 strings. Before, strings with multi-byte UTF-8 codepoints would cause formatting inconsistencies or even crashes. ( [ Issue #6 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-oxifmt/issues/6) )
  - Fixed an inconsistency in negative number formatting. Now, it will always print a regular hyphen (e.g. â-2â), which is consistent with Rustâs behavior; before, it would occasionally print a minus sign instead (as observed in a comment to [ Issue #4 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-oxifmt/issues/4) ).
  - Added compatibility with Typst 0.8.0âs new type system.

===  v0.2.0

  - The packageâs name is now ` oxifmt ` !
  - ` oxifmt:0.2.0 ` is now available through Typstâs Package Manager! You can now write ` #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.0": strfmt ` to use the library.
  - Greatly improved the README, adding a section for common examples.
  - Fixed negative numbers being formatted with two minus signs.
  - Fixed custom precision of floats not working when they are exact integers.

===  v0.1.0

  - Initial release, added ` strfmt ` .

=  zen-zine

0.1.0

Excellently type-set a fun little zine!

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=zen-zine&version=0.1.0)

Excellently type-set a cute little zine about your favorite topic!

Providing your eight pages in order will produce a US-Letter page with the
content in a layout ready to be folded into a zine! The content is wrapped
before movement so that padding and alignment are respected.

Here is the template and its preview:



    #import "@preview/zen-zine:0.1.0": zine

    #set document(author: "Tom", title: "Zen Zine Example")
    #set text(font: "Linux Libertine", lang: "en")

    #let my_eight_pages = (
      range(8).map(
        number => [
          #pad(2em, text(10em, align(center, str(number))))
        ]
      )
    )

    // provide your content pages in order and they
    // are placed into the zine template positions.
    // the content is wrapped before movement so that
    // padding and alignment are respected.
    #zine(

    )


![Image of

==  Improvement Ideas

Roughly in order of priority.

  - Write documentation and generate a manual
  - Deduce ` page ` properties so that user can change the page they wish to use.
    - Make sure the page is ` flipped ` and deduce the zine page width and height from the full page width and height (and the zine margin)
    - Iâm currently struggling with finding out the page properties (whatâs the ` #get ` equivalent to ` #set ` ?)
  - Add other zine sizes (there is a 16 page one I believe?)
  - Digital mode where zine pages are separate pages (of the same size) rather than âsub pagesâ of a printer page

= *minideck.md*

=  minideck

0.2.1

Simple dynamic slides.

A small package for dynamic slides in typst.

minideck provides basic functionality for dynamic slides ( ` pause ` , `
uncover ` , â¦), integration with [ fletcher
](https://typst.app/universe/package/fletcher) and [ CetZ
](https://typst.app/universe/package/cetz/) , and some minimal infrastructure
for theming.

==  Usage

Call ` minideck.config ` to get the functions you want to use:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide, title-slide, pause, uncover, only) = minideck.config()
    #show: template

    #title-slide[
      = Slides with `minideck`
      == Some examples
      John Doe

      #datetime.today().display()
    ]

    #slide[
      = Some title

      Some content

      #show: pause

      More content

      1. One
      2. Two
      #show: pause
      3. Three
    ]


This will show three subslides with progressively more content. (Note that the
default theme uses the font Libertinus Sans from the [ Libertinus
](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus) family, so you may want to install
it.)

Instead of ` #show: pause ` , you can use ` #uncover(2,3)[...] ` to make
content visible only on subslides 2 and 3, or ` #uncover(from: 2)[...] ` to
have it visible on subslide 2 and following.

The ` only ` function is similar to ` uncover ` , but instead of hiding the
content (without affecting the layout), it removes it.



    #slide[
      = `uncover` and `only`

      #uncover(1, from:3)[
        Content visible on subslides 1 and 3+
        (space reserved on 2).
      ]

      #only(2,3)[
        Content included on subslides 2 and 3
        (no space reserved on 1).
      ]

      Content always visible.
    ]


Contrary to ` pause ` , the ` uncover ` and ` only ` functions also work in
math mode:



    #slide[
      = Dynamic equation

      $
        f(x) &= x^2 + 2x + 1  \
             #uncover(2, $&= (x + 1)^2$)
      $
    ]


When mixing ` pause ` with ` uncover ` / ` only ` , the sequence of pauses
should be taken as reference for the meaning of subslide indices. For example
content after the first pause always appears on the second subslide, even if
itâs preceded by a call to ` #uncover(from: 3)[...] ` .

The package also works well with [ pinit
](https://typst.app/universe/package/pinit) :



    #import "@preview/pinit:0.1.4": *

    #slide[
      = Works well with `pinit`

      Pythagorean theorem:

      $ #pin(1)a^2#pin(2) + #pin(3)b^2#pin(4) = #pin(5)c^2#pin(6) $

      #show: pause

      $a^2$ and $b^2$ : squares of triangle legs

      #only(2, {
        pinit-highlight(1,2)
        pinit-highlight(3,4)
      })

      #show: pause

      $c^2$ : square of hypotenuse

      #pinit-highlight(5,6, fill: green.transparentize(80%))
      #pinit-point-from(6)[larger than $a^2$ and $b^2$]
    ]


===  Handout mode

minideck can make a handout version of the document, in which dynamic behavior
is disabled: the content of all subslides is shown together in a single slide.

To compile a handout version, pass ` --input handout=true ` in the command
line:



    typst compile --input handout=true myfile.typ


It is also possible to enable handout mode from within the document, as shown
in the next section.

===  Configuration

The behavior of the minideck functions depends on the settings passed to `
minideck.config ` . For example, handout mode can also be enabled like this:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide, pause) = minideck.config(handout: true)
    #show: template

    #slide[
      = Slide title

      Some text

      #show: pause

      More text
    ]


(The default value of ` handout ` is ` auto ` , in which case minideck checks
for a command line setting as in the previous section.)

` minideck.config ` accepts the following named arguments:

  - ` paper ` : a string for one of the paper size names recognized by [ ` page.paper ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-paper) , or one of the shorthands ` "16:9" ` or ` "4:3" ` . Default: ` "4:3" ` .
  - ` landscape ` : use the paper size in landscape orientation. Default: ` true ` .
  - ` width ` : page width as an absolute length. Takes precedence over ` paper ` and ` landscape ` .
  - ` height ` : page height as an absolute length. Takes precedence over ` paper ` and ` landscape ` .
  - ` handout ` : whether to make a document for handout, with content of all subslides shown together in a single slide.
  - ` theme ` : the theme (see below).
  - ` cetz ` : the CeTZ module (see below).
  - ` fletcher ` : the fletcher module (see below).

For example to make slides with 16:9 aspect ratio, use `
minideck.config(paper: "16:9") ` .

===  Themes

Use ` minideck.config(theme: ...) ` to select a theme. Currently there is only
one built-in: ` minideck.themes.simple ` . However you can also pass a theme
implemented by yourself or from a third-party package. See the [ theme
documentation
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/minideck/0.2.1/themes/README.md)
for how that works.

Themes are functions and can be configured using the standard [ ` with `
method ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/#definitions-
with) :

  - The ` simple ` theme has a ` variant ` setting with values âlightâ (default) and âdarkâ.

Hereâs an example:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide) = minideck.config(
      theme: minideck.themes.simple.with(variant: "dark"),
    )
    #show: template

    #slide[
      = Slide with dark theme

      Some text
    ]


Note that you can override part of a theme with show and set rules:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide) = minideck.config(
      theme: minideck.themes.simple.with(variant: "dark"),
    )
    #show: template

    #set page(footer: none) // get rid of the page number
    #show heading: it => text(style: "italic", it)
    #set text(red)

    #slide[
      = Slide with dark theme and red text

      Some text
    ]


===  Integration with CeTZ

You can use ` uncover ` and ` only ` (but not ` pause ` ) in CeTZ figures,
with the following extra steps:

  - Get CeTZ-specific functions ` cetz-uncover ` and ` cetz-only ` by passing the CeTZ module to ` minideck.config ` (see example below).

This ensures that minideck uses CeTZ functions from the correct version of
CeTZ.

  - Add a ` context ` keyword outside the ` canvas ` call.

This is required to access the minideck subslide state from within the canvas
without making the content opaque (CeTZ needs to inspect the canvas content to
make the drawing).

Example:



    #import "@preview/cetz:0.2.2" as cetz: *
    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide, only, cetz-uncover, cetz-only) = minideck.config(cetz: cetz)
    #show: template

    #slide[
      = In a CeTZ figure

      Above canvas
      #context canvas({
        import draw: *
        cetz-only(3, rect((0,-2), (14,4), stroke: 3pt))
        cetz-uncover(from: 2, rect((0,-2), (16,2), stroke: blue+3pt))
        content((8,0), box(stroke: red+3pt, inset: 1em)[
          A typst box #only(2)[on 2nd subslide]
        ])
      })
      Below canvas
    ]


===  Integration with fletcher

The same steps are required as for CeTZ integration (passing the fletcher
module to get fletcher-specific functions), plus an additional step:

  - Give explicitly the number of subslides to the ` slide ` function.

This is required because I could not find a reliable way to update a typst
state from within a fletcher diagram, so I cannot rely on the state to keep
track of the number of subslides.

Example:



    #import "@preview/fletcher:0.5.0" as fletcher: diagram, node, edge
    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"
    #let (template, slide, fletcher-uncover) = minideck.config(fletcher: fletcher)
    #show: template

    #slide(steps: 2)[
      = In a fletcher diagram

      #set align(center)

      Above diagram

      #context diagram(
        node-stroke: 1pt,
        node((0,0), [Start], corner-radius: 2pt, extrude: (0, 3)),
        edge("-|>"),
        node((1,0), align(center)[A]),
        fletcher-uncover(from: 2, edge("d,r,u,l", "-|>", [x], label-pos: 0.1))
      )

      Below diagram
    ]


==  Comparison with other slides packages

Performance: minideck is currently faster than [ Polylux
](https://typst.app/universe/package/polylux/) when using ` pause ` ,
especially for incremental compilation, but a bit slower than [ Touying
](https://typst.app/universe/package/touying) , according to my tests.

Features: Polylux and Touying have more themes and more features, for example
support for [ pdfpc ](https://pdfpc.github.io/) which provides speaker notes
and more. Minideck allows using ` uncover ` and ` only ` in CeTZ figures and
fletcher diagrams, which Polylux currently doesnât support.

Syntax: package configuration is simpler in minideck than Touying but a bit
more involved than in Polylux. The minideck ` pause ` is more cumbersome to
use: one must write ` #show: pause ` instead of ` #pause ` . On the other hand
minideckâs ` uncover ` and ` only ` can be used directly in equations
without requiring a special math environment as in Touying (I think).

Other: minideck sometimes has better error messages than Touying due to
implementation differences: the minideck stack trace points back to the
userâs code while Touying errors sometimes point only to an output page
number.

==  Limitations

  - ` pause ` , ` uncover ` and ` only ` work in enumerations but they require explicit enum indices ( ` 1. ... ` rather than ` + ... ` ) as they cause a reset of the list index.
  - Usage in a CeTZ canvas or fletcher diagram requires a ` context ` keyword in front of the ` canvas ` / ` diagram ` call (see above).
  - fletcher diagrams also require to specify the number of subslides explicitly (see above).
  - ` pause ` doesnât work in CeTZ figures, fletcher diagrams and math mode.
  - ` pause ` requires writing ` #show: pause ` and its effect is lost after the ` #show ` call goes out of scope. For example this means that one can use ` pause ` inside of a grid, but further ` pause ` calls after the grid (in the same slide) wonât work as intended.

==  Internals

The package uses states with the following keys:

` __minideck-subslide-count ` : an array of two integers for counting pauses
and keeping track of the subslide number automatically. The first value is the
number of subslides so far referenced in current slide. The second value is
the number of pauses seen so far in the current slide. Both values are kept in
one state so that an update function can update the number of subslides based
on the number of pauses, without requiring a context. This avoids problems
with layout convergence.

` __minideck-subslide-step ` : the current subslide being generated while
processing a slide.

= *ez-today.md*

=  ez-today

0.1.0

Simply displays the full current date.

Simply displays the current date with easy to use customization.

==  Included languages

German, English, French and Italian months can be used out of the box. If you
want to use a language that is not included, you can easily add it yourself.
This is shown in the customization section below.

==  Usage

The usage is very simple, because there is only the ` today() ` function.



    #import "@preview/ez-today:0.1.0"

    // To get the current date use this
    #ez-today.today()


==  Reference

===  ` today `

Prints the current date with given arguments.



    #let today(
      lang: "de",
      format: "d. M Y",
      custom-months: ()
    ) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` lang ` : [ ` str ` ] â Select one of the included languages (de, en, fr, it).
  - ` format ` : [ ` str ` ] â Specify the output format.
  - ` custom-months ` : [ ` array ` ] of [ ` str ` ] â Use custom names for each month. This array must have 12 entries. If this is used, the ` lang ` argument does nothing.

==  Customization

The default output prints the full current date with German months like this:



    #ez-today.today()   // 11. Oktober 2024


You can choose one of the included languages with the ` lang ` argument:



    #ez-today.today(lang: "en")   // 11. October 2024
    #ez-today.today(lang: "fr")   // 11. Octobre 2024
    #ez-today.today(lang: "it")   // 11. Ottobre 2024


You can also change the format of the output with the ` format ` argument.
Pass any string you want here, but know that the following characters will be
replaced with the following:

  - ` d ` â The current day as a decimal
  - ` m ` â The current month as a decimal ( ` lang ` argument does nothing)
  - ` M ` â The current month as a string with either the selected language or the custom array
  - ` y ` â The current year as a decimal with the last two numbers
  - ` Y ` â The current year as a decimal

Here are some examples:



    #ez-today.today(lang: "en", format: "M d Y")    // October 11 2024
    #ez-today.today(format: "m-d-y")                // 10-11-24
    #ez-today.today(format: "d/m")                  // 11/10
    #ez-today.today(format: "d.m.Y")                // 11.10.2024


Use the ` custom-months ` argument to give each month a custom name. You can
add a new language or use short terms for each month.



    // Defining some custom names
    #let my-months = ("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
    // Get current date with custom names
    #ez-today.today(custom-months: my-months, format: "M-y")    // Oct-24


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` ez-today `



    #import "@preview/ez-today:0.1.0"

    )


==  Documentation

===  ` card `

Defines a card by updating the below ` counter ` and ` state ` (s), and
dropping a label.



    #let card(header, footer, question, answer) = [
      #cardnumber.step()
      #cardheader.update(header)
      #cardfooter.update(footer)
      #cardquestion.update(question)
      #cardanswer.update(answer)
      <card>
    ]


====  Arguments

  - ` header `
  - ` footer `
  - ` question `
  - ` answer `

===  card builders

*How they work*

  1. Find all locations of the ` <card> ` label
  2. Get the values of the ` cardnumber ` counter, and ` cardheader ` , ` cardfooter ` , ` cardquestion ` , ` cardanswer ` states at each ` <card> ` .
  3. Populates an array of questions and an array of answers using these values
     - The ` #a48up ` and ` #letter8up ` functions describe the layout of each card for each item in these arrays, and also rearrange the answers so that the layout makes sense when printed double sided.
  4. Loop over the arrays and dump each itemâs ` content ` onto the page.
     - in the case of ` #a48up ` and ` letter8up ` , each item is dumped into a 2-column table.

` cartao ` comes builtin with the following card building functions. Take a
look at the source for how they work, and use them as a guide to help you
build your own flashcards with different sizes/formats.

===  ` a48up `

Produces a 2x8 portrait card layout on a4 paper.

Designed to be printed double-sided on the perforated 8-up a4 card paper you
can find on [ Amazon
](https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=a4+perforated+card&crid=37RT2L4H5XSD0&sprefix=a4+perforated+ca%2Caps%2C648&ref=nb_sb_noss)

= *tada.md*

=  tada

0.1.0

Easy, composable tabular data manipulation

TaDa provides a set of simple but powerful operations on rows of data. A full
manual is available online: [ https://github.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/blob/v0.1.0/docs/manual.pdf ](https://github.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/blob/v0.1.0/docs/manual.pdf)

Key features include:

  - *Arithmetic expressions* : Row-wise operations are as simple as string expressions with field names

  - *Aggregation* : Any function that operates on an array of values can perform row-wise or column-wise aggregation

  - *Data representation* : Handle displaying currencies, floats, integers, and more with ease and arbitrary customization

Note: This library is in early development. The API is subject to change
especially as typst adds more support for user-defined types. *Backwards
compatibility is not guaranteed!* Handling of field info, value types, and
more may change substantially with more user feedback.

==  Importing

TaDa can be imported as follows:

===  From the official packages repository (recommended):



    #import "@preview/tada:0.1.0"


===  From the source code (not recommended)

*Option 1:* You can clone the package directly into your project directory:



    # In your project directory
    git clone https://github.com/ntjess/typst-tada.git tada


Then import the functionality with



    #import "./tada/lib.typ"


*Option 2:* If Python is available on your system, use the provided
packaging script to install TaDa in typstâs ` local ` directory:



    # Anywhere on your system
      git clone https://github.com/ntjess/typst-tada.git
      cd typst-tada

        --namespace local



Now, TaDa is available under the local namespace:



    #import "@local/tada:0.1.0"


==  Creation

TaDa provides three main ways to construct tables â from columns, rows, or
records.

  - *Columns* are a dictionary of field names to column values. Alternatively, a 2D array of columns can be passed to ` from-columns ` , where ` values.at(0) ` is a column (belongs to one field).

  - *Records* are a 1D array of dictionaries where each dictionary is a row.

  - *Rows* are a 2D array where ` values.at(0) ` is a row (has one value for each field). Note that if ` rows ` are given without field names, they default to (0, 1, â¦$n$).



    #let column-data = (
      name: ("Bread", "Milk", "Eggs"),
      price: (1.25, 2.50, 1.50),
      quantity: (2, 1, 3),
    )
    #let record-data = (
      (name: "Bread", price: 1.25, quantity: 2),
      (name: "Milk", price: 2.50, quantity: 1),
      (name: "Eggs", price: 1.50, quantity: 3),
    )
    #let row-data = (
      ("Bread", 1.25, 2),
      ("Milk", 2.50, 1),
      ("Eggs", 1.50, 3),
    )

    #import tada: TableData
    #let td = TableData(data: column-data)
    // Equivalent to:
    #let td2 = tada.from-records(record-data)
    // _Not_ equivalent to (since field names are unknown):
    #let td3 = tada.from-rows(row-data)

    #to-tablex(td)
    #to-tablex(td2)
    #to-tablex(td3)


![Example 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-01.png)

==  Title formatting

You can pass any ` content ` as a fieldâs ` title ` . *Note* : if you pass
a string, it will be evaluated as markup.



    #let fmt(it) = {
      heading(outlined: false,
        upper(it.at(0))
        + it.slice(1).replace("_", " ")
      )
    }

    #let titles = (
      // As a function
      name: (title: fmt),
      // As a string
      quantity: (title: fmt("Qty")),
    )
    #let td = TableData(..td, field-info: titles)

    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-02.png)

==  Adapting default behavior

You can specify defaults for any field not explicitly populated by passing
information to ` field-defaults ` . Observe in the last example that ` price `
was not given a title. We can indicate it should be formatted the same as `
name ` by passing ` title: fmt ` to ` field-defaults ` . *Note* that any
field that is explicitly given a value will not be affected by ` field-
defaults ` (i.e., ` quantity ` will retain its string title âQtyâ)



    #let defaults = (title: fmt)
    #let td = TableData(..td, field-defaults: defaults)
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-03.png)

==  Using ` __index `

TaDa will automatically add an ` __index ` field to each row that is hidden by
default. If you want it displayed, update its information to set ` hide: false
` :



    // Use the helper function `update-fields` to update multiple fields
    // and/or attributes
    #import tada: update-fields
    #let td = update-fields(
      td, __index: (hide: false, title: "\#")
    )
    // You can also insert attributes directly:
    // #td.field-info.__index.insert("hide", false)
    // etc.
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-04.png)

==  Value formatting

===  ` type `

Type information can have attached metadata that specifies alignment, display
formats, and more. Available types and their metadata are:

  - *string* : (default-value: "", align: left)

  - *content* : (display: , align: left)

  - *float* : (align: right)

  - *integer* : (align: right)

  - *percent* : (display: , align: right)

  - *index* : (align: right)

While adding your own default types is not yet supported, you can simply
defined a dictionary of specifications and pass its keys to the field



    #let currency-info = (
      display: tada.display.format-usd, align: right
    )
    #td.field-info.insert("price", (type: "currency"))
    #let td = TableData(..td, type-info: ("currency": currency-info))
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-05.png)

==  Transposing

` transpose ` is supported, but keep in mind if columns have different types,
an error will be a frequent result. To avoid the error, explicitly pass `
ignore-types: true ` . You can choose whether to keep field names as an
additional column by passing a string to ` fields-name ` that is evaluated as
markup:



    #to-tablex(
      tada.transpose(
        td, ignore-types: true, fields-name: ""
      )
    )


![Example 6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-06.png)

===  ` display `

If your type is not available or you want to customize its display, pass a `
display ` function that formats the value, or a string that accesses ` value `
in its scope:



    #td.field-info.at("quantity").insert(
      "display",
      val => ("/", "One", "Two", "Three").at(val),
    )

    #let td = TableData(..td)
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-07.png)

===  ` align ` etc.

You can pass ` align ` and ` width ` to a given fieldâs metadata to
determine how content aligns in the cell and how much horizontal space it
takes up. In the future, more ` tablex ` setup arguments will be accepted.



    #let adjusted = update-fields(
      td, name: (align: center, width: 1.4in)
    )
    #to-tablex(adjusted)


![Example 8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-08.png)

==  Deeper ` tablex ` customization

TaDa uses ` tablex ` to display the table. So any argument that ` tablex `
accepts can be passed to TableData as well:



    #let mapper = (index, row) => {
      let fill = if index == 0 {rgb("#8888")} else {none}
      row.map(cell => (..cell, fill: fill))
    }
    #let td = TableData(
      ..td,
      tablex-kwargs: (
        map-rows: mapper, auto-vlines: false
      ),
    )
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-09.png)

==  Subselection

You can select a subset of fields or rows to display:



    #import tada: subset
    #to-tablex(
      subset(td, indexes: (0,2), fields: ("name", "price"))
    )


![Example 10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-10.png)

Note that ` indexes ` is based on the tableâs ` __index ` column, _not_
itâs positional index within the table:



    #let td2 = td
    #td2.data.insert("__index", (1, 2, 2))
    #to-tablex(
      subset(td2, indexes: 2, fields: ("__index", "name"))
    )


![Example 11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-11.png)

Rows can also be selected by whether they fulfill a field condition:



    #to-tablex(
      tada.filter(td, expression: "price < 1.5")
    )


![Example 12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-12.png)

==  Concatenation

Concatenating rows and columns are both supported operations, but only in the
simple sense of stacking the data. Currently, there is no ability to join on a
field or otherwise intelligently merge data.

  - ` axis: 0 ` places new rows below current rows

  - ` axis: 1 ` places new columns to the right of current columns

  - Unless you specify a fill value for missing values, the function will panic if the tables do not match exactly along their concatenation axis.

  - You cannot stack with ` axis: 1 ` unless every column has a unique field name.



    #import tada: stack

    #let td2 = TableData(
      data: (
        name: ("Cheese", "Butter"),
        price: (2.50, 1.75),
      )
    )
    #let td3 = TableData(
      data: (
        rating: (4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5),
      )
    )

    // This would fail without specifying the fill
    // since `quantity` is missing from `td2`
    #let stack-a = stack(td, td2, missing-fill: 0)
    #let stack-b = stack(stack-a, td3, axis: 1)
    #to-tablex(stack-b)


![Example 13](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-13.png)

==  Expressions

The easiest way to leverage TaDaâs flexibility is through expressions. They
can be strings that treat field names as variables, or functions that take
keyword-only arguments.

  - *Note* ! When passing functions, every field is passed as a named argument to the function. So, make sure to capture unused fields with ` ..rest ` (the name is unimportant) to avoid errors.



    #let make-dict(field, expression) = {
      let out = (:)
      out.insert(
        field,
        (expression: expression, type: "currency"),
      )
      out
    }

    #let td = update-fields(
      td, ..make-dict("total", "price * quantity" )
    )

    #let tax-expr(total: none, ..rest) = { total * 0.2 }
    #let taxed = update-fields(
      td, ..make-dict("tax", tax-expr),
    )

    #to-tablex(
      subset(taxed, fields: ("name", "total", "tax"))
    )


![Example 14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-14.png)

==  Chaining

It is inconvenient to require several temporary variables as above, or deep
function nesting, to perform multiple operations on a table. TaDa provides a `
chain ` function to make this easier. Furthermore, when you need to compute
several fields at once and donât need extra field information, you can use `
add-expressions ` as a shorthand:



    #import tada: chain, add-expressions
    #let totals = chain(td,
      add-expressions.with(
        total: "price * quantity",
        tax: "total * 0.2",
        after-tax: "total + tax",
      ),
      subset.with(
        fields: ("name", "total", "after-tax")
      ),
      // Add type information
      update-fields.with(
        after-tax: (type: "currency", title: fmt("w/ Tax")),
      ),
    )
    #to-tablex(totals)


![Example 15](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-15.png)

==  Sorting

You can sort by ascending/descending values of any field, or provide your own
transformation function to the ` key ` argument to customize behavior further:



    #import tada: sort-values
    #to-tablex(sort-values(
      td, by: "quantity", descending: true
    ))


![Example 16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-16.png)

==  Aggregation

Column-wise reduction is supported through ` agg ` , using either functions or
string expressions:



    #import tada: agg, item
    #let grand-total = chain(
      totals,
      agg.with(after-tax: array.sum),
      // use "item" to extract exactly one element
      item
    )
    // "Output" is a helper function just for these docs.
    // It is not necessary in your code.
    #output[
      *Grand total: #tada.display.format-usd(grand-total)*
    ]


![Example 17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-17.png)

It is also easy to aggregate several expressions at once:



    #let agg-exprs = (
      "# items": "quantity.sum()",
      "Longest name": "[#name.sorted(key: str.len).at(-1)]",
    )
    #let agg-td = tada.agg(td, ..agg-exprs)
    #to-tablex(agg-td)

tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-18.png)

Numeric Typst

==  Numty

===  Numeric Typst

A library for performing mathematical operations on n-dimensional matrices,
vectors/arrays, and numbers in Typst, with support for broadcasting and
handling NaN values. Numtyâs broadcasting rules and API are inspired by
NumPy.



    #import "numty.typ" as nt

    // Define vectors and matrices
    #let a = (1, 2, 3)
    #let b = 2
    #let m = ((1, 2), (1, 3))

    // Element-wise operations with broadcasting
    #nt.mult(a, b)  // Multiply vector 'a' by scalar 'b': (2, 4, 6)
    #nt.add(a, a)   // Add two vectors: (2, 4, 6)
    #nt.add(2, a)   // Add scalar '2' to each element of vector 'a': (3, 4, 5)
    #nt.add(m, 1)   // Add scalar '1' to each element of matrix 'm': ((2, 3), (2, 4))

    // Dot product of vectors
    #nt.dot(a, a)   // Dot product of vector 'a' with itself: 14

    // Handling NaN cases in mathematical functions
    #calc.sin((3, 4)) // Fails, as Typst does not support vector operations directly
    #nt.sin((3.4))    // Sine of each element in vector: (0.14411, 0.90929)

    // Generate equally spaced values and vectorized functions
    #let x = nt.linspace(0, 10, 3)  // Generate 3 equally spaced values between 0 and 10: (0, 5, 10)
    #let y = nt.sin(x)              // Apply sine function to each element: (0, -0.95, -0.54)

    // Logical operations
    #nt.eq(a, b)      // Compare each element in 'a' to 'b': (false, true, false)
    #nt.any(nt.eq(a, b)) // Check if any element in 'a' equals 'b': true
    #nt.all(nt.eq(a, b)) // Check if all elements in 'a' equal 'b': false

    // Handling special cases like division by zero
    #nt.div((1, 3), (2, 0))  // Element-wise division, with NaN for division by zero: (0.5, float.nan)

    // Matrix operations (element-wise)
    #nt.add(m, 1)  // Add scalar to matrix elements: ((2, 3), (2, 4))

    // matrix
    #nt.transpose(m)  // transposition
    #nt.matmul(m,m) //  matrix multipliation
    #nt.matmul(c(1,2), r(2,3)) //  colum vector times row vector multiplication.
    #np.trace(m) // trace
    #np.det(m) /2x2 determinant

    // printing
    #nt.print(m, " != " , (1,2))  // long dollar print, see in pdf
    #nt.p(m, " != " , (1,2))  //  short long print print, see in pdf


Since vesion 0.0.4 n-dim matrices are supported as well in most operations.

==  Supported Features:

===  Dimensions:

Numty uses standard typst list as a base type, most 1d operations like dot are
suported directly for them.

For matrix specific operations we use 2d arrays / nested arrays, that are also
the standard typst list, but nested like in: ((1,2), (1,1)).

For convenience you can create column or row vectors with the #nt.c and #nt.r
functions.



    #import "numty.typ" as nt
    #import "numty.typ": c, r

    #let a = (1,2,3)
    #let b = (3,2,1)
    #c(..a) // ((1,),(2,),(3,))
    #r(..b) // ((3,2,1),)
    #nt.matmul(c(..a), r(..b)) // column @ row



===  Logic Operations:



    #let a = (1,2,3)
    #let b = 2

    #nt.eq(a,b)  // (false, true, false)
    #nt.all(nt.eq(a,b))  // false
    #nt.any(nt.eq(a,b))  // true


===  Math operators:

All operators are element-wise, traditional matrix multiplication is not yet
supported.



    #nt.add((0,1,3), 1)  // (1,2,4)
    #nt.mult((1,3),(2,2)) // (2,6)
    #nt.div((1,3), (2,0)) // (0.5,float.nan)


===  Algebra with Nan handling:



    #nt.log((0,1,3)) //  (float.nan, 0 , 0.47...)
    #nt.sin((1,3)) //  (0.84.. , 0.14...)


===  Vector operations:

Basic vector operations



    #nt.dot((1,2),(2,4))  //  9
    #nt.normalize((1,4), l:1) // (1/5,4/5)


===  Others:

Functions for creating equally spaced indexes in linear and logspace, usefull
for log plots, to sample in acordance to the logarithmic space.



    #nt.linspace(0,10,3) // (0,5,10)
    #nt.logspace(1,3,3)
    #nt.geomspace(1,3,3)


===  Matrix



    #nt.matmul(m,m )              // matrix multiplication
    #nt.det(((1,3), (3,4)))       // only 2x2 supported for now
    #nt.trace(((1,3), (3,4)))     // trace of square matrix
    #nt.transpose(((1,3), (3,4))) // matrix transposition


===  Printing

Numty supports $ printing to the pdf of numerical matrices, both long and
short format.



    #nt.print((1,2),(4,2)))  // to display in the pdf
    #nt.p((1,2),(4,2)), " random string ")     // to display in the pdf


===  How to add

Time to kill? Search for words in a box of letters!

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=cereal-words&version=0.1.0)

Oh no, the Typst guys jumbled the letters! Bring order into this mess by
finding the hidden words.

This small game is playable in the Typst editor and best enjoyed with the web
app or ` typst watch ` . It was first released for the 24 Days to Christmas
campaign in winter of 2023.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` cereal-words ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/cereal-words


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` game ` function, which accepts a single positional
argument for the game input.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` game `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/cereal-words:0.1.0": game

==  Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on the
typst web app.



    #import "@preview/flyingcircus:3.2.0": *

    #show: FlyingCircus.with(
      Title: title,
      Author: author,
      CoverImg: image("images/cover.png"),
      Dedication: [It's Alive!!! MUAHAHAHA!],
    )

    #FCPlane(read("My Plane_stats.json"), Nickname:"My First Plane")


==  Usage

The first thing is the FlyingCircus style.



    #import "@preview/flyingcircus:3.2.0": *

    /// Defines the FlyingCircus template
    ///
    /// - Title (str): Title of the document. Goes in metadata and on title page.
    /// - Author (str): Author(s) of the document. Goes in metadata and on title page.
    /// - CoverImg (image): Image to make the first page of the document.
    /// - Description (str): Text to go with the title on the title page.
    /// - Dedication (str): Dedication to go down below the title on the title page.
    /// - body (content)
    /// -> content

    // Example
    #show: FlyingCircus.with(
      Title: title,
      Author: author,
      CoverImg: image("images/cover.png"),
      Dedication: [It's Alive!!! MUAHAHAHA!],
    )


Next is the FCPlane function for making plane pages.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Plane page.  Always on a new page. Image optional.
    ///
    /// - Plane (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the plane stats.
    /// - Nickname (str): Nickname to go under the aircraft name.
    /// - Img (image | none): Image to go at the top of the page. Set to none to remove.
    /// - BoxText (dictionary): Pairs of values to go in the box over the image. Does nothing if no Img provided.
    /// - BoxAnchor (str): Which anchor of the image to put the box in?  Sample values are "north", "south-west", "center".
    /// - DescriptiveText (content)
    /// -> content


    // Example
    #FCPlane(
      read("Basic Biplane_stats.json"),
      Nickname: "Bring home the bacon!",
      Img: image("images/Bergziegel_image.png"),
      BoxText: ("Role": "Fast Bomber", "First Flight": "1601", "Strengths": "Fastest Bomber"),
      BoxAnchor: "north-east",
    )[
    #lorem(100)
    ]


The FCVehicleSimple is for when you want to put multiple vehicles on a page.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Simple Vehicle.  Not always a full page. Image optional.
    ///
    /// - Vehicle (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the Vehicle stats.
    /// - Img (image): Image to go above the vehicle. (optional)
    /// - DescriptiveText (content)
    /// -> content
    #FCVehicleSimple(read("Sample Vehicle_stats.json"))[#lorem(120)]


FCVehicleFancy is a one or two page vehicle that looks nicer but takes up more
space.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Vehicle page.  Always on a new page. Image optional.
    /// If the Img is provided, it will take up two facing pages, otherwise only one, but a full page, unlike the Simple.
    ///
    /// - Vehicle (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the Vehicle stats.
    /// - Img (image | none): Image to go at the top of the first page. Set to none to remove.
    /// - TextVOffset (length): How far to push the text down the page. Want to do that inset text thing the book does? You can, the text can overlap with thte image.  Does nothing if no Img provided.
    /// - BoxText (dictionary): Pairs of values to go in the box over the image. Does nothing if no Img provided.
    /// - BoxAnchor (str): Which anchor of the image to put the box in?  Sample values are "north", "south-west", "center".

    /// - AfterContent (content): Goes after the stat block. Always present.
    /// -> content

    // Example
    #FCVehicleFancy(
      read("Sample Vehicle_stats.json"),
      Img: image("images/Wandelburg.png"),
      TextVOffset: 6.2in,
      BoxText: ("Role": "Fast Bomber", "First Flight": "1601", "Strengths": "Fastest Bomber"),
      BoxAnchor: "north-east",
    )[
    #lorem(100)
    ][
    #lorem(100)
    ]


Last of the vehicles, FCShip is for boats like Into the Drink.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Ship page.  Always on a new page. Image optional.
    ///
    /// - Ship (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the Ship stats.
    /// - Img (image | none): Image to go at the top of the page. Set to none to remove.
    /// - DescriptiveText (content): Goes below the name and above the stats table.
    /// - notes (content): Goes in the notes section.
    /// -> content

    // Example: No builder for Ships, so you'll have to put it in your own JSON, or just a dict, like this.
    #let ship_stats = (
      Name: "Macchi Frigate",
      Speed: 5,
      Handling: 15,
      Hardness: 9,
      Soak: 0,
      Strengths: "-",
      Weaknesses: "-",
      Weapons: (
        (Name: "x2 Light Howitzer", Fore: "x1", Left: "x2", Right: "x2", Rear: "x1"),
        (Name: "x6 Pom-Pom Gun", Fore: "x2", Left: "x3", Right: "x3", Rear: "x2", Up: "x6"),
        (Name: "x2 WMG", Left: "x1", Right: "x1"),
      ),
      DamageStates: ("", "-1 Speed", "-3 Guns", "-1 Speed", "-3 Guns", "Sinking"),
    )

    #FCShip(
      Img: image("images/Macchi Frigate.png"),
      Ship: ship_stats,
    )[
      #lorem(100)
    ][
      #lorem(5)
    ]


Additional functions include FCWeapon



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Weapon card. Image optional.
    ///
    /// - Weapon (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the Weapon stats.
    /// - Img (image | none): Image to go above the card. Set to none to remove.
    /// - DescriptiveText (content): Goes below the name and above the stats table.
    /// -> content

    //Example
    #FCWeapon(
      (Name: "Rifle/Carbine", Cells: (Hits: 1, Damage: 2, AP: 1, Range: "Extreme"), Price: "Scrip", Tags: "Manual"),
      Img: image("images/Rifle.png"),
    )[
    Note that you can set the text in the cell boxes to whatever you want.
    ]


KochFont:



    /// Sets the tex to the Koch Fette FC font for people who don't want to remember the font name.
    ///
    /// - body (content)
    /// - ..args: Any valid argument to the text function
    /// -> content

    // Example
    #KochFont(size: 18pt)[Vehicles]


and HiddenHeading, which is for adding to the table of contents without
actually putting words on the page.



    //If we don't want all our planes at the top level of the table of contents.  EX: if we want
    // - Intro
    // - Story
    // - Planes
    //   - First Plane
    // We break the page, and create a HiddenHeading, that doesn't show up in the document (Or a normal heading, if that's what you need)
    //Then we set the heading offset to one so everything after that is indented one level in the table of contents.
    #pagebreak()
    #HiddenHeading[= Vehicles]
    #set heading(offset: 1)


    New in Version 3.2.0, the FCPlaybook (+utilities), FCNPCShort, and FCAirshipShort

    //This creates pages like the playbook. Largely customizable, for say, chariots of steel versions.
    // - Name (str) The name of the Playbook
    // - Subhead (str) The text that goes with the name in the header
    // - Character (content) This is the entire left column
    // - Questions (content) This is the top section of the right column, for motivation and trust questions.
    // - Starting (content) Middle section of the right column. Starting Assets, Burdens, Planes, Vices, ect
    // - Stats (content) Bottom section of the right column. Just the four FCPStatTable calls (and a colbreak, probably)
    // - StatNames () Define the stats to draw circles for on the top part of the 2nd page
    // - Triggers (content) List of triggers, includes section, because not all playbooks use the same text there.
    // - Vents (content) List of Vents, customizable like Triggers
    // - Intimacy (content) Bottom section of the left column, for the intimacy move
    // - Moves (content) The entire right column of the second page
    //
    // Utilities for use with FCPlaybook
    // - FCPRule()  The full-column horizontal line

===  With ` raw `

You can also use [ ` raw ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/raw/) for
the conversion. This is useful if the notation uses a lot of backslashes.



    #import "@preview/ascii-ipa:2.0.0": praat

    // regular string
    #praat("\\'1\\cf\\hs\\cf\\:f\\'2\\ae\\sh\\:ftl\\ic")

    // raw
    #praat(`\'1\cf\hs\cf\:f\'2\ae\sh\:ftl\ic`)


Note: ` raw ` will not play nicely with notations that use ` ` ` a lot.

==  Brackets & Braces

You can easily mark your notation text as different types of brackets or
braces.

= *gridlock.md*

=  gridlock

0.2.0

Grid typesetting in Typst

Grid typesetting in Typst. Use this package if you want to line up your body
text across columns and pages.

==  Example

![An example image showing a two-column page with headings, a block quote, a
footnote, a figure, a display formula, and a bulleted list. All body text in
both columns lines
up.](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/gridlock/0.2.0/docs/assets/example-
lines.png)

==  Getting Started



    #import "@preview/gridlock:0.2.0": *

    #show: gridlock.with()

    #lock[= This is a heading]

    #lorem(30)

    #figure(
      placement: auto,
      caption: [a caption],
      rect()
    )

    #lorem(30)


==  Usage

Check out [ the manual
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/gridlock/0.2.0/docs/gridlock-
manual.pdf) for a detailed description.

To get started, import the package into your document:



    #import "@preview/gridlock:0.2.0": *


Set up the basic parameters:



    #show: gridlock.with(
      paper: "a4",
      margin: (y: 76.445pt),
      font-size: 11pt,
      line-height: 13pt
    )


You can now use the ` lock() ` function to align any block to the text grid.
Block quotes bulleted/numbered lists, and floating figures do _not_ need to be
wrapped in ` lock() ` . Their spacing is handled fully automatically.



    #lock[= Heading]

    #lorem(50)

    #lock(figure(
      rect(),
      caption: [An example figure aligned to the grid.]
    ))

    #lorem(50)

    #lock[$ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 $]

    #lorem(50)


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` gridlock `



    #import "@preview/gridlock:0.2.0"

= *natrix.md*

=  natrix

0.1.0

Natural and consistent matrix for typst.

![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/natrix/0.1.0/natrix.svg)

` natrix.nat ` is a drop-in replacement for ` mat ` with some additional
features. ` nat ` ensures that each row in your matrix should have the similar
height, unless one of them becomes too tall.

At this moment, it is recommended to use ` nat ` only in display equations,
but not in inline equations. This is because ` nat ` looks a little bit off
when used in inline equations.

==  Documentation

===  ` nat `

Every thing is the same as ` mat ` in typst.

This package also provides ` bnat ` , ` Bnat ` , ` vnat ` , ` Vnat ` ,

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` natrix `

template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/bamdone-
aiaa-0.1.1-small.webp)

=  bamdone-aiaa

0.1.1

An American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) template for
conferences.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=bamdone-aiaa&version=0.1.1)

This is a Typst template for a one-column paper from the proceedings of the
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. The paper is tightly
spaced, fits a lot of content and comes preconfigured for numeric citations
from BibLaTeX or Hayagriva files.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` bamdone-aiaa ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/bamdone-aiaa


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` aiaa ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` authors-and-affiliations ` : An array of author dictionaries and affiliation dictionaries. Author dictionaries must have a ` name ` key and can have the keys ` job ` , ` department ` , ` aiaa ` is optional. Affiliation dictionaries must have the keys ` institution ` , ` city ` , ` state ` , ` zip ` , and ` country ` .
  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or ` none ` . Appears at the top of the first column in boldface. Shall be ` content ` .
  - ` paper-size ` : Defaults to ` us-letter ` . Specify a [ paper size string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-paper) to change the page format.
  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the ` bibliography ` function or ` none ` . Specifying this will configure numeric, AIAA-style citations.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
paper.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` aiaa `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/bamdone-aiaa:0.1.0": aiaa

    #show: aiaa.with(
      title: [A typesetting system to untangle the scientific writing process],
      abstract: [
        These instructions give you guidelines for preparing papers for AIAA Technical Papers. Use this document as a template if you are using Typst. Otherwise, use this document as an instruction set. Define all symbols used in the abstract. Do not cite references in the abstract. The footnote on the first page should list the Job Title and AIAA Member Grade for each author, if known. Authors do not have to be AIAA members.

Parse, normalize and show publication frontmatter, including authors and
affiliations

_Beautiful scientific documents with structured metadata for publishers_

[ ![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/typst-docs-orange.svg)
](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/docs.pdf) [
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/LICENSE)

Pubmatter is a typst library for parsing, normalizing and showing scientific
publication frontmatter.

Utilities for loading, normalizing and working with authors, affiliations,
abstracts, keywords and other frontmatter information common in scientific
publications. Our goal is to introduce standardized ways of working with this
content to expose metadata to scientific publishers who are interested in
using typst in a standardized way. The specification for this ` pubmatter ` is
based on [ MyST Markdown ](https://mystmd.org/) and [ Quarto
](https://quarto.org/) , and can load their YAML files directly.

==  Examples

Pubmatter was used to create these documents, for loading the authors in a
standardized way and creting the common elements (authors, affiliations,
ORCIDs, DOIs, Open Access Links, copyright statements, etc.)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curvenote/pubmatter/main/images/agrogeo.png?raw=true)

==  Documentation

The full documentation can be found in [ docs.pdf
](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/docs.pdf) . To use `
pubmatter ` import it:



    #import "@preview/pubmatter:0.1.0"


The docs also use ` pubmatter ` , in a simplified way, you can see the [
docs.typ ](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/docs.typ) to see a
simple example of using various components to create a new document. Here is a
preview of the docs:

[
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curvenote/pubmatter/main/images/pubmatter.png?raw=true)
](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/docs.pdf)

===  Loading Frontmatter

The frontmatter can contain all information for an article, including title,
authors, affiliations, abstracts and keywords. These are then normalized into
a standardized format that can be used with a number of ` show ` functions
like ` show-authors ` . For example, we might have a YAML file that looks like
this:



    author: Rowan Cockett
    date: 2024/01/26


You can load that file with ` yaml ` , and pass it to the ` load ` function:



    #let fm = pubmatter.load(yaml("pubmatter.yml"))


This will give you a normalized data-structure that can be used with the `
show ` functions for showing various parts of a document.

You can also use a ` dictionary ` directly:



    #let fm = pubmatter.load((
      author: (
        (
          name: "Rowan Cockett",
          email: "rowan@curvenote.com",
          orcid: "0000-0002-7859-8394",
          affiliations: "Curvenote Inc.",
        ),
      ),
      date: datetime(year: 2024, month: 01, day: 26),
      doi: "10.1190/tle35080703.1",
    ))
    #pubmatter.show-author-block(fm)


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curvenote/pubmatter/main/images/author-
block.png?raw=true)

===  Theming

The theme including color and font choice can be set using the ` THEME `
state. For example, this document has the following theme set:



    #let theme = (color: red.darken(20%), font: "Noto Sans")
    #set page(header: pubmatter.show-page-header(theme: theme, fm), footer: pubmatter.show-page-footer(fm))
    #state("THEME").update(theme)


Note that for the ` header ` the theme must be passed in directly. This will
hopefully become easier in the future, however, there is a current bug that
removes the page header/footer if you set this above the ` set page ` . See [
https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2987
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pubmatter/0.1.0/#2987)
.

The ` font ` option only corresponds to the frontmatter content (abstracts,
title, header/footer etc.) allowing the body of your document to have a
different font choice.

===  Normalized Frontmatter Object

The frontmatter object has the following normalized structure:



    title: content
    subtitle: content
    short-title: string # alias: running-title, running-head
    # Authors Array
    # simple string provided for author is turned into ((name: string),)
    authors: # alias: author
      - name: string
        url: string # alias: website, homepage
        email: string
        phone: string
        fax: string
        orcid: string # alias: ORCID
        note: string
        corresponding: boolean # default: `true` when email set
        equal-contributor: boolean # alias: equalContributor, equal_contributor
        deceased: boolean
        roles: string[] # must be a contributor role
        affiliations: # alias: affiliation
          - id: string
            index: number
    # Affiliations Array
    affiliations: # alias: affiliation
      - string # simple string is turned into (name: string)
      - id: string
        index: number
        name: string
        institution: string # use either name or institution
    # Other publication metadata
    open-access: boolean
    license: # Can be set with a SPDX ID for creative commons
      id: string
      url: string
      name: string
    doi: string # must be only the ID, not the full URL
    date: datetime # validates from 'YYYY-MM-DD' if a string
    citation: content
    # Abstracts Array
    # content is turned into ((title: "Abstract", content: string),)
    abstracts: # alias: abstract
      - title: content
        content: content


Note that you will usually write the affiliations directly in line, in the
following example, we can see that the output is a normalized affiliation
object that is linked by the ` id ` of the affiliation (just the name if it is
a string!).



    #let fm = pubmatter.load((
      authors: (
        (
          name: "Rowan Cockett",
          affiliations: "Curvenote Inc.",
        ),
        (
          name: "Steve Purves",
          affiliations: ("Executable Books", "Curvenote Inc."),
        ),
      ),
    ))
    #raw(lang:"yaml", yaml.encode(fm))

0.1.0

Help the Typst Guys reach the helicopter pad and save Christmas!

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=icicle&version=0.1.0)

Help the Typst Guys reach the helicopter pad and save Christmas! Navigate them
with the WASD keys and solve puzzles with snowballs to make way for the Typst
Guys.

This small Christmas-themed game is playable in the Typst editor and best
enjoyed with the web app or ` typst watch ` . It was first released for the 24
Days to Christmas campaign in winter of 2023.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` icicle ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/icicle


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` game ` function, which accepts a positional
argument for the game input.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` game `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/icicle:0.1.0": game
    #show: game

    // Move with WASD.


You can also add your own levels by adding an array of level definition
strings in the ` game ` functionâs named ` levels ` argument. Each level
file must conform to the following format:

  - First, a line with two comma separated integers indicating the playerâs starting position.
  - Then, a matrix with the characters f (floor), x (wall), w (water), or g (goal).
  - Finally, a matrix with the characters b (snowball) or _ (nothing).

The three arguments must be separated by double newlines. Additionally, each
row in the matrices space-separates its values. Newlines terminate the rows.
Comments can be added with a double slash. Find an example for a valid level
string below:



    // The starting position
    0, 0

    // The back layer
    f f f w f f f
    f f f w f f f
    f f x w f f f
    f f f w f f f
    f f f w f x x
    x x x g x x x

    // The front layer.
    _ _ b _ _ _ _
    _ _ b _ _ _ _
    _ _ _ _ b _ _
    _ _ _ _ b _ _
    _ _ _ _ _ _ _
    _ _ _ _ _ _ _


Itâs best to put levels into separate files and load them with the ` read `
function.

= *unify.md*

=  unify

0.7.0

Format numbers, units, and ranges correctly.

Featured  Package

` unify ` is a [ Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) package simplifying
the typesetting of numbers, units, and ranges. It is the equivalent to
LaTeXâs ` siunitx ` , though not as mature.

==  Overview

` unify ` allows flexible numbers and units, and still mostly gets well
typeset results.



    #import "@preview/unify:0.7.0": num,qty,numrange,qtyrange

    $ num("-1.32865+-0.50273e-6") $
    $ qty("1.3+1.2-0.3e3", "erg/cm^2/s", space: "#h(2mm)") $
    $ numrange("1,1238e-2", "3,0868e5", thousandsep: "'") $
    $ qtyrange("1e3", "2e3", "meter per second squared", per: "/", delimiter: "\"to\"") $


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/unify/0.7.0/examples/overview.jpg)

Right now, physical, monetary, and binary units are supported. New issues or
pull requests for new units are welcome!

==  Multilingual support

The Unify package supports multiple languages. Currently, the supported
languages are English and Russian. The fallback is English. If you want to add
your language, you should add two files: ` prefixes-xx.csv ` and ` units-
xx.csv ` , and in the ` lib.typ ` file you should fix the ` lang-db ` state
for your files.

==  ` num `

` num ` uses string parsing in order to typeset numbers, including separators
between the thousands. They can have the following form:

  - ` float ` or ` integer ` number
  - either ( ` {} ` stands for a number)
    - symmetric uncertainties with ` +-{} `
    - asymmetric uncertainties with ` +{}-{} `
  - exponential notation ` e{} `

Parentheses are automatically set as necessary. Use ` thousandsep ` to change
the separator between the thousands, and ` multiplier ` to change the
multiplication symbol between the number and exponential.

==  ` unit `

` unit ` takes the unit in words or in symbolic notation as its first
argument. The value of ` space ` will be inserted between units if necessary.
Setting ` per ` to ` symbol ` will format the number with exponents (i.e. `
^(-1) ` ), ` fraction ` or ` / ` using fraction, and ` fraction-short ` or `
\\/ ` using in-line fractions.
Units in words have four possible parts:

  - ` per ` forms the inverse of the following unit.
  - A written-out prefix in the sense of SI (e.g. ` centi ` ). This is added before the unit.
  - The unit itself written out (e.g. ` gram ` ).
  - A postfix like ` squared ` . This is added after the unit and takes ` per ` into account.

The shorthand notation also has four parts:

  - ` / ` forms the inverse of the following unit.
  - A short prefix in the sense of SI (e.g. ` k ` ). This is added before the unit.
  - The short unit itself (e.g. ` g ` ).
  - An exponent like ` ^2 ` . This is added after the unit and takes ` / ` into account.

Note: Use ` u ` for micro.

The possible values of the three latter parts are loaded at runtime from `
prefixes.csv ` , ` units.csv ` , and ` postfixes.csv ` (in the library
directory). Your own units etc. can be permanently added in these files. At
runtime, they can be added using ` add-unit ` and ` add-prefix ` ,
respectively. The formats for the pre- and postfixes are:

pre-/postfix  |  shorthand  |  symbol
---|---|---
milli  |  m  |  upright(âmâ)

and for units:

unit  |  shorthand  |  symbol  |  space
---|---|---|---
meter  |  m  |  upright(âmâ)  |  true

The first column specifies the written-out word, the second one the shorthand.
These should be unique. The third column represents the string that will be
inserted as the unit symbol. For units, the last column describes whether
there should be space before the unit (possible values: ` true ` / ` false ` ,
` 1 ` , ` 0 ` ). This is mostly the cases for degrees and other angle units
(e.g. arcseconds).
If you think there are units not included that are of interest for other
users, you can create an issue or PR.

==  ` qty `

` qty ` allows a ` num ` as the first argument following the same rules. The
second argument is a unit. If ` rawunit ` is set to true, its value will be
passed on to the result (note that the string passed on will be passed to `
eval ` , so add escaped quotes ` \" ` if necessary). Otherwise, it follows the
rules of ` unit ` . The value of ` space ` will be inserted between units if
necessary, ` thousandsep ` between the thousands, and ` per ` switches between
exponents and fractions.

==  ` numrange `

` numrange ` takes two ` num ` s as the first two arguments. If they have the
same exponent, it is automatically factorized. The range symbol can be changed
with ` delimiter ` , and the space between the numbers and symbols with `
space ` .

==  ` qtyrange `

` qtyrange ` is just a combination of ` unit ` and ` range ` .

0.1.0

Easily write DnD 5e style campaign documents.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=wenyuan-campaign&version=0.1.0)

A template for writing RPG campaigns imitating the 5e theme. This was made as
a typst version of the $\LaTeX$ package [ DnD 5e LaTeX Template
](https://github.com/rpgtex/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template) , though it is not
functionally nor entirely visually similar.

Packages:

  - ` droplet:0.3.1 `

Fonts:

  - TeX Gyre Bonum
  - Scaly Sans
  - Scaly Sans Caps
  - Royal Initalen
  - äº¬è¯èå®ä½ KingHwa OldSong

_*Please note: in an effort to reduce the file size of the template, fonts
are included in MY repository only, not in the typst official one.* _ You may
find the fonts in my [ github repository in the fonts folder
](https://github.com/yanwenywan/typst-packages/tree/master/wenyuan-
campaign/0.1.0/template/fonts) , or download them yourself, or heck provide
your own fonts to your liking.



    typst init @preview/wenyuan-campaign:0.1.0


This will copy over all required fonts and comes prefilled with the standard
template so you can see how it works. To use this you need to either install
all the fonts locally or pass the folder into --font-path when compiling.

To initialise the style, do:



    #import "@preview/wenyuan-campaign:0.1.0": *

    #show: conf.with()


Very easy.

Optionally, you may set all the theme fonts from the configure function (the
defaults are shown):



    #import "@preview/wenyuan-campaign:0.1.0": *

    #show: conf.with(
        fontsize: 10pt,
        mainFont: ("TeX Gyre Bonum", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        titleFont: ("TeX Gyre Bonum", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        sansFont: ("Scaly Sans Remake", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        sansSmallcapsFont: ("Scaly Sans Caps", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        dropcapFont: "Royal Initialen"
    )

0.1.0

Wrap content in custom functions with just indentation

` wrap-indent ` is a package for wrapping content in custom functions with
just indentation. This lets you avoid using trailing square brackets to wrap
content, instead you just indent it!

This system works by re-purposing Typstâs existing [ term-list
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/terms/) syntax via a custom show rule
on ` terms.item ` . We give it our custom function within [ state
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/introspection/state/) via a new ` wrap-in()
` function.

==  Hereâs a minimal example!

![A minimal
example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/wrap-
indent/0.1.0/example_page1.png)



    #set page(height: auto, width: 3.5in, margin: 0.25in)

    #import "@preview/wrap-indent:0.1.0": wrap-in, allow-wrapping

    #show terms.item: allow-wrapping

    / First --:
      A normal term list

      with multiple paragraphs

    But this text is separated


    #line(length: 100%)


    #let custom-block(content) = rect(content,
      fill: orange.lighten(90%),
      stroke: 1.5pt + gradient.linear(..color.map.flare)
    )

    / #wrap-in(custom-block):
      A *custom block* using the `wrap-in` function

      with indented text \
      over multiple lines

    And this text is _still_ separated!


And in its own code block, hereâs the required initialization:



    #import "@preview/wrap-indent:0.1.0": wrap-in, allow-wrapping

    #show terms.item: allow-wrapping


==  And hereâs a more complicated example!

![A more complicated
example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/wrap-
indent/0.1.0/example_page2.png)



    #set page(height: auto, width: 4.1in, margin: 0.25in)

    #show heading: set text(size: 0.75em)
    #show heading: set block(below: 1em)
    #set heading(numbering: "1) ")

    = Normal function call:

    // A function for wrapping some text:
    #let custom-quote(body) = rect(
      body,
      width: 100%,
      fill: luma(95%),
      stroke: (left: 2pt + luma(30%))
    )

    #custom-quote[
      Some text in a _custom quote_ spread over multiple lines
      so it actually looks like it was typed in a document.
    ]
    This text is outside the quote box


    = Wrappped function call!

    / #wrap-in(custom-quote):
      Some text in a _custom quote_ spread over multiple lines
      so it actually looks like it was typed in a document.

    This text is _still_ outside the quote box!


    = Arbitrary functions should _just work#emoji.tm;_

    / #wrap-in(x => ellipse(align(center, x),
        stroke: 3pt + gradient.conic(..color.map.rainbow)
      )):
      Some text in a _rainbow ellipse_ spread
      over multiple lines so it actually looks
      like it was typed in a document.


    = One-liners look great!

    / #wrap-in(underline): Here's one line underlined


    = Let's do some math:

    #let named-thm(name) = (content) => {
      pad(left: 2em, par(hanging-indent: -2em)[
        *Theorem* (#name) #emph(content)
      ])
    }

    / #wrap-in(named-thm("Operational Soundness")):
      If $med tack e : tau$ and $e$ reduces to $e'$
      by zero or more steps and $"Irred"(e')$,
      then $e' in "Val"$ and $med tack e' : tau$.


    = In-line styling doesn't create blocks:

    / #wrap-in(highlight):
      This text is highlighted.
    This text isn't.

    Notice how there was *no* paragraph break between the
    two sentences? This is a useful result that makes
    `wrap-indent` really flexible!

    (if you want separate blocks, use `block` in your function)


    = Does it work with nesting?

    / #wrap-in(custom-quote):
      Testing...
      / #wrap-in(align.with(center)):
        / #wrap-in(rect):
          / #wrap-in(emph):
            Signs point to yes!


    = Final thoughts

    / Note --:
      Regular term lists still work!

    / Disclaimer --:
      You may run into issues with other term list
      show rules conflicting with this rule. \
      (although set rules should be unaffected)

      If you run into issues, _let me know!_ I'd love to hear
      about it to make this package as robust as possible.


    = And

    #let big-statement(content) = {
      align(center, text(
        underline(stroke: 1.5pt, content),
        size: 32pt,
        weight: "bold",
        style: "italic",
        fill: eastern,
      ))
    }

    / #wrap-in(big-statement):
      That's a wrap!

  - 0.1.0 Initial release

==  Basic usage

It can help improve readability with nested applications to a content value,
or make the diff cleaner.



    #compose_((
      text.with(blue),
      emph,
      strong,
      underline,
      strike,
    ))[This is a very long content with a lot of words]
    // Is equivalent to
    #text(
      blue,
      emph(
        strong(
          underline(
            strike[This is a very long content with a lot of words]
          )
        )
      )
    )


You can use it for show rules just like the example above.



    #show link: compose_.with((
      text.with(fill: blue),
      emph,
      underline,
    ))
    // These two are equivalent
    #show link: text.with(fill: blue)
    #show link: emph
    #show link: underline


This can also be useful when you need to destructure lists, as it allows
creating binds that are scoped by each lambda expression.



    #let two_and_one = pipe(
      (1, 2),
      (
        ((a, b)) => (a, b, -1), // becomes a list of length three
        ((a, b, _)) => (b, a), // discard the third element and swap
      ),
    )

0.1.1

Anatomy of a Font. Visualise metrics.

_Anatomy of a Font_ . Visualise metrics.

Import the ` anatomy ` package:



    #import "@preview/anatomy:0.1.1": metrics


==  Display Metrics

` metrics(72pt, "EB Garamond", display: "Typewriter") ` will be rendered as
follows:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E8D08F/packages/main/packages/preview/anatomy/0.1.1/img/export-1.svg)

Additionally, a closure using ` metrics ` dictionary as parameter can be used
to layout additional elements below:



    #metrics(54pt, "ä¸é»æé«",
      display: "é»å³æå­æ©",
      use: metrics => table(
        columns: 2,
        ..metrics.pairs().flatten().map(x => [ #x ])
      )
    )


It will generate:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E8D08F/packages/main/packages/preview/anatomy/0.1.1/img/export-2.svg)

==  Remark on Hybrid Typesetting

To typeset CJK text, adopting fontâs ascender/descender as ` top-edge ` / `
bottom-edge ` makes more sense in some cases. As for most CJK fonts, the
difference between ascender and descender heights will be exact 1em.

Tested with ` metrics(54pt, "Hiragino Mincho ProN", "ãã¬ã¿ã¤ãç«¯æ«") `
:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E8D08F/packages/main/packages/preview/anatomy/0.1.1/img/export-3.svg)

Since Typst will use metrics of the font which has the largest advance height
amongst the list provided in ` set text(font: ( ... )) ` to set up top and
bottom edges of a line, leading might not work as expected in hybrid
typesetting. This issue can be solved by passing the document to `
metrics(use: metrics => { ... }) ` like this:



    #show: doc => metrics(font.size, font.main,
      // Retrieve the metrics of the CJK font
      use: metrics => {
        set text(
          font.size,
          font: ( font.latin, font.main ),
          features: ( "pkna", ),
          // Use CJK fontâs ascender/descender as top/bottom edges
          top-edge: metrics.ascender,
          bottom-edge: metrics.descender,
          // ...
        )

        doc
      }
    )

= *idwtet.md*

=  idwtet

0.3.0

Package for uniform, correct and simplified typst code demonstration.

The name ` idwtet ` stands for âI Donât Wanna Type Everything Twiceâ. It
provides a ` typst-ex ` and a ` typst-ex-code ` codeblock, which _shows*and*
executes _ typst code.

It is meant for code demonstration, e.g. when publishing a package, and
provides some niceties:

  - the code should always be correct in the examples: As the example code is used for the code block, but also for evaluation, there is no need to write it twice
  - easy configuration with simple, uniform and good look

However, there are some limitations:

  - Every code block has its own local scope and the default behaviour is that variables are not reachable from outside. A similar restriction lies on import statements. That is why, there is the ` eval-scope ` argument, which captures variables and simulates global variables. Additionally, a ` typst ` codeblock is provided for a consistent look.
  - Locality can be displayed to the users by automatically wrapping code in ` typst-ex-code ` , but ` typst-ex ` does not provide such functionality. It might thus be difficult for users to understand code examples this way.
  - The page width has to be defined in absolute terms. It is quite nice, for a showcase, to take the least possible space, but tracking the widths of all boxes and then setting the page width accordingly is not (yet) possible.

==  Usage

Only one function is defined, ` init(body, bcolor: luma(210), inset: 5pt,
border: 2pt, radius: 2pt, content-font: "linux libertine", code-font-size:
9pt, content-font-size: 11pt, code-return-box: true, wrap-code: false, eval-
scope: (:), escape-bracket: "%") ` , which is supposed to be used with a show
rule.

Then raw codeblocks (with ` block=true ` ) of the languages ` typst ` , `
typst-ex ` , ` typst-code ` and ` typst-ex-code ` are modified. The main
feature of this package are ` typst-ex ` and ` typst-ex-code ` . The ` typst `
and ` typst-code ` blocks do not evaluate anything, but their design fits that
of the others.

The parameters of ` init ` are:

  - ` body ` : for usage with show rule, hence the whole document.
  - ` bcolor ` : the background- (and border-) color of the blocks
  - ` inset ` : inset param of code and content blocks, should be â¥ 2pt
  - ` border ` : border thickness
  - ` radius ` : block radius
  - ` content-font ` : The font used in the previewed content / result.
  - ` code-font-size ` : The fontsize used in the code blocks.
  - ` content-font-size ` : The fontsize used in the preview content / result.
  - ` code-return-box ` : If to show the code return type on ` typst-ex-code ` blocks.
  - ` wrap-code ` : If to wrap the code in ` #{ ` and ` } ` , to symbolize local scope.
  - ` eval-scope ` : A dictionary with the keys as the variable names and the values as another dictionary with keys ` value ` and ` code ` , both of these are optional. The former has the defined value, the latter the code recreate the variable, for usage in the code blocks.
  - ` escape-bracket ` : The text to wrap a variable with, to access the ` code ` part of a ` eval-scope ` variable.

==  Hiding code and replacements

There are currently two methods to change the code:

  - use the ` eval-scope ` argument from the ` init ` function. There is a ` code ` field in the dictionaries, which enables the usage of the key escaped in ` escape-bracket ` to be replaced in the codeblock code half and to be removed in the codeblock result half, as the value is given via scope. Take a look at the example below, where ` %ouset% ` is used this way.
  - use the ` ENDHIDDEN ` feature. When escaped in ` escape-bracket ` , everything above the statement is removed from the codeblock code half BUT everything (without the ` ENDHIDDEN ` statement) is evaluated. Take a look at the example in the examples folder.

==  Example



    #set page(margin: 0.5cm, width: 14cm, height: auto)
    #import "@preview/idwtet:0.1.0"
    #show: idwtet.init.with(eval-scope: (
      ouset: (
        value: {import "@preview/ouset:0.1.1": ouset; ouset},
        code: "#import \"@preview/ouset:0.1.1\": ouset"
      )
    ))

    == ouset package #text(gray)[(v0.1.1)]
    ```typst-ex
    %ouset%
    $
    "Expression 1" ouset(&, <==>, "Theorem 1") "Expression 2"\
                   ouset(&, ==>,, "Theorem 7") "Expression 3"
    $
    ```
    Or something like
    ```typst-ex-code
    let a = range(10)
    a
    ```


Further examples are given in the repo example folder.

= *down.md*

=  down

0.1.0

Pass down arguments of `sum`, `integral`, etc. to the next line, which can
generate shorthand to present reusable segments.

Pass down arguments of ` sum ` , ` integral ` , etc. to the next line, which
can generate shorthand to present reusable segments. While writing long step-
by-step equations, only certain parts of a line change. ` down ` leverages
Typstâs ` context ` (from version 0.11.0) to help relieve the pressure of
writing long and repetitive formulae.

Import the package:



    #import "@preview/down:0.1.0": *


==  Usage

Create new contexts by using camel-case commands, such as ` Limit(x, +0) ` .
Retrieve the contextual with ` cLimit ` .

  - ` Limit(x, c) ` and ` cLimit ` :



    $
    Lim(x, +0) x ln(sin x)
      = cLim ln(sin x) / x^(-1)
      = cLim x / (sin x) cos x
      = 0
    $


  - ` Sum(index, lower, upper) ` and ` cSum ` :



    $
    Sum(n, 0, oo) 1 / sqrt(n + 1)
      = Sum(#none, 0, #none) 1 / sqrt(n)
      = cSum 1 / n^(1 / 2)
    $


  - ` Integral(lower, upper, f, dif: [x]) ` , ` cIntegral(f) ` and ` cIntegrated(f) ` :



    $
    Integral(0, pi / 3, sqrt(1 + tan^2 x))
      = cIntegral(1 / (cos x))
      = cIntegrated(ln (cos x / 2 + sin x / 2) / (cos x / 2 - sin x / 2))
      = ln (2 + sqrt(3))
    $

*Quill* is a package for creating quantum circuit diagrams in [ Typst
](https://typst.app/) .

_Note, that this package is in beta and may still be undergoing breaking
changes. As new features like data types and scoped functions will be added to
Typst, this package will be adapted to profit from the new paradigms._

_Meanwhile, we suggest importing everything from the package in a local scope
to avoid polluting the global namespace (see example below)._

  - [ *Changelog* ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/quill/0.5.0/#changelog)

==  Basic usage

The function ` quantum-circuit() ` takes any number of positional gates and
works somewhat similarly to the built-int Typst functions ` table() ` or `
grid() ` . A variety of different gate and instruction commands are available
for adding elements and integers can be used to produce any number of empty
cells (filled with the current wire style). A new wire is started by adding a
` [\ ] ` item.



    #{
      import "@preview/quill:0.5.0": *

      quantum-circuit(
        lstick($|0âª$), $H$, ctrl(1), rstick($(|00âª+|11âª)/â2$, n: 2), [\ ],
        lstick($|0âª$), 1, targ(), 1
      )
    }


![Bell circuit](https://github.com/user-
attachments/assets/53d0c581-ab62-44e3-abf5-5497993d7aba)

Plain quantum gates â such as a Hadamard gate â can be written with the
shorthand notation ` $H$ ` instead of the more lengthy ` gate($H$) ` . The
latter offers more options, however.

Refer to the [ user guide ](https://github.com/Mc-
Zen/quill/releases/download/v0.5.0/quill-guide.pdf) for a full documentation
of this package. You can also look up the documentation of any function by
calling the help module, e.g., ` help("gate") ` in order to print the
signature and description of the ` gate ` command, just where you are
currently typing (powered by [ tidy ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/tidy) ).

==  Cheat Sheet

Instead of listing every featured gate (as is done in the [ user guide
](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/quill/releases/download/v0.5.0/quill-guide.pdf) ),
this gallery quickly showcases a large selection of possible gates and
decorations that can be added to any quantum circuit.

==  Tequila

_Tequila_ is a submodule that adds a completely different way of building
circuits.



    #import "@preview/quill:0.5.0" as quill: tequila as tq

    #quill.quantum-circuit(
      ..tq.build(
        tq.h(0),
        tq.cx(0, 1),
        tq.cx(0, 2),
      ),
      quill.gategroup(x: 2, y: 0, 3, 2)
    )


This is similar to how _QASM_ and _Qiskit_ work: gates are successively
applied to the circuit which is then layed out automatically by packing gates
as tightly as possible. We start by calling the ` tq.build() ` function and
filling it with quantum operations. This returns a collection of gates which
we expand into the circuit with the ` .. ` syntax. Now, we still have the
option to add annotations, groups, slices, or even more gates via manual
placement.

The syntax works analog to Qiskit. Available gates are ` x ` , ` y ` , ` z ` ,
` h ` , ` s ` , ` sdg ` , ` sx ` , ` sxdg ` , ` t ` , ` tdg ` , ` p ` , ` rx `
, ` ry ` , ` rz ` , ` u ` , ` cx ` , ` cz ` , and ` swap ` . With ` barrier `
, an invisible barrier can be inserted to prevent gates on different qubits to
be packed tightly. Finally, with ` tq.gate ` and ` tq.mqgate ` , a generic
gate can be created. These two accept the same styling arguments as the normal
` gate ` (or ` mqgate ` ).

Also like Qiskit, all qubit arguments support ranges, e.g., ` tq.h(range(5)) `
adds a Hadamard gate on the first five qubits and ` tq.cx((0, 1), (1, 2)) `
adds two CX gates: one from qubit 0 to 1 and one from qubit 1 to 2.

With Tequila, it is easy to build templates for quantum circuits and to
compose circuits of various building blocks. For this purpose, ` tq.build() `
and the built-in templates all feature optional ` x ` and ` y ` arguments to
allow placing a subcircuit at an arbitrary position of the circuit. As an
example, Tequila provides a ` tq.graph-state() ` template for quickly drawing
graph state preparation circuits.

The following example demonstrates how to compose multiple subcircuits.



    #import tequila as tq

    #quantum-circuit(
      ..tq.graph-state((0, 1), (1, 2)),
      ..tq.build(y: 3,
          tq.p($pi$, 0),
          tq.cx(0, (1, 2)),
        ),
      ..tq.graph-state(x: 6, y: 2, invert: true, (0, 1), (0, 2)),
      gategroup(x: 1, 3, 3),
      gategroup(x: 1, y: 3, 3, 3),
      gategroup(x: 6, y: 2, 3, 3),
      slice(x: 5)
    )

==  Tests

This package uses [ typst-test ](https://github.com/tingerrr/typst-test/) for
running [ tests ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/quill/tree/v0.5.0/tests/) .

==  Changelog

===  v0.5.0

  - Added support for multi-controlled gates with Tequila.
  - Switched to using ` context ` instead of the now deprecated ` style() ` for measurement. Note: Starting with this version, Typst 0.11.0 or higher is required.

===  v0.4.0

  - Alternative model for creating and composing circuits: [ Tequila ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/quill/0.5.0/#tequila) .

===  v0.3.0

  - New features
    - Enable manual placement of gates, ` gate($X$, x: 3, y: 1) ` , similar to built-in ` table() ` in addition to automatic placement. This works for most elements, not only gates.
    - Add parameter ` pad ` to ` lstick() ` and ` rstick() ` .
    - Add parameter ` fill-wires ` to ` quantum-circuit() ` . All wires are filled unto the end (determined by the longest wire) by default (breaking change â ï¸). This behavior can be reverted by setting ` fill-wires: false ` .
    - ` gategroup() ` ` slice() ` and ` annotate() ` can now be placed above or below the circuit with ` z: "above" ` and ` z: "below" ` .
    - ` help() ` command for quickly displaying the documentation of a given function, e.g., ` help("gate") ` . Powered by [ tidy ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/tidy) .
  - Improvements:
    - Complete rework of circuit layout implementation
      - allows transparent gates since wires are not drawn through gates anymore. The default fill is now ` auto ` and using ` none ` sets the background to transparent.
      - ` midstick ` is now transparent by default.
    - ` setwire() ` can now be used to override only partial wire settings, such as wire color ` setwire(1, stroke: blue) ` , width ` setwire(1, stroke: 1pt) ` or wire distance, all separately. Before, some settings were reset.
  - Fixes:
    - Fixed ` lstick ` / ` rstick ` when equation numbering is turned on.
  - Removed:
    - The already deprecated ` scale-factor ` (use ` scale ` instead)

===  v0.2.1

  - Improvements:
    - Add ` fill ` parameter to ` midstick() ` .
    - Add ` bend ` parameter to ` permute() ` .
    - Add ` separation ` parameter to ` permute() ` .
  - Fixes:
    - With Typst 0.11.0, ` scale() ` now takes into account outer alignment. This broke the positioning of centered/right-aligned circuits, e.g., ones put into a ` figure() ` .
    - Change wires to be drawn all through ` ctrl() ` , making it consistent to ` swap() ` and ` targ() ` .

===  v0.2.0

  - New features:
    - Add arbitrary labels to any ` gate ` (also derived gates such as ` meter ` , ` ctrl ` , â¦), ` gategroup ` or ` slice ` that can be anchored to any of the nine 2d alignments.
    - Add optional gate inputs and outputs for multi-qubit gates (see gallery).
    - Implicit gates (breaking change â ï¸): a content item automatically becomes a gate, so you can just type ` $H$ ` instead of ` gate($H$) ` (of course, the ` gate() ` function is still important in order to use the many available options).
  - Other breaking changes â ï¸:
    - ` slice() ` has no ` dx ` and ` dy ` parameters anymore. Instead, labels are handled through ` label ` exactly as in ` gate() ` . Also the ` wires ` parameter is replaced with ` n ` for consistency with other multi-qubit gates.
    - Swap order of row and column parameters in ` annotate() ` to make it consistent with built-in Typst functions.
  - Improvements:
    - Improve layout (allow row/column spacing and min lengths to be specified in em-lengths).
    - Automatic bounds computation, even for labels.
    - Improve meter (allow multi-qubit gate meters and respect global (per-circuit) gate padding).d
  - Fixes:
    - ` lstick ` / ` rstick ` braces broke with Typst 0.7.0.
    - ` lstick ` / ` rstick ` bounds.
  - Documentation
    - Add section on creating custom gates.
    - Add section on using labels.
    - Explain usage of ` slice() ` and ` gategroup() ` .

= *lasaveur.md*

=  lasaveur

0.1.3

Porting vim-latex's math shorthands to Typst. An accommendating vim syntax
file is provided in the repo.

This is a Typst package for speedy mathematical input, inspired by [ vim-latex
](https://github.com/vim-latex/vim-latex) . This project is named after my Vim
plugin [ vimtex-lasaveur ](https://github.com/yangwenbo99/vimtex-lasaveur) ,
which ports the operations in vim-latex to [ vimtex
](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) .

==  Usages in Typst

Either use the file released in âReleasesâ or import using the following
command:



    #import "@preview/lasaveur:0.1.3": *


This script generates a Typst library that defines shorthand commands for
various mathematical symbols and functions. Hereâs an overview of what it
provides and how a user can use it:

  1. Mathematical Functions:
     - Usage: ` f<key>(argument) `
     - Examples: ` fh(x) ` for hat, ` ft(x) ` for tilde, ` f2(x) ` for square root
  2. Font Styles:
     - Usage: ` f<key>(argument) `
     - Examples: ` fb(x) ` for bold, ` fbb(x) ` for blackboard bold, ` fca(x) ` for calligraphic
  3. Greek Letters:
     - Usage: ` k<key> `
     - Examples: ` ka ` for Î± (alpha), ` kb ` for Î² (beta), ` kG ` for Î (capital Gamma)
  4. Common Mathematical Symbols:
     - Usage: ` g<key> `
     - Examples: ` g8 ` for â (infinity), ` gU ` for âª (union), ` gI ` for â© (intersection)
  5. LaTeX-compatible Symbols:
     - Usage: Direct LaTeX command names
     - Examples: ` partial ` for â, ` infty ` for â, ` cdot ` for â
  6. Arrows:
     - Usage: ` ar.<key> `
     - Examples: ` ar.l ` for â, ` ar.r ` for â, ` ar.lr ` for â

Users can employ these shorthands in their Typst documents to quickly input
mathematical symbols and functions. The exact prefix for each category (like `
f ` for functions or ` k ` for Greek letters) can be customized using command-
line arguments when running the script.

For instance, in a Typst document, after importing the generated library, a
user could write:



    $fh(x) + ka + g8 + ar.r$


This would produce: xÌ + Î± + â + â

The script provides a wide range of symbols covering most common mathematical
notations, making it easier and faster to type complex mathematical
expressions in Typst â especially for users migrating from vim-latex.

==  Accompanying Vim Syntax File

The syntax file provides more advanced and correct concealing for both
Typstâs built-in math syntax and the lasaveur shorthands. Download the
syntax file from the âReleasesâ section and place it in your `
~/.vim/after/syntax/ ` directory. The ` syntax.vim ` file in the repo is
supposed to be used by the generation script and it _will not work_ if
directly sourced in Vim.

template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/mantys-0.1.4-small.webp)

=  mantys

0.1.4

Helpers to build manuals for Typst packages.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=mantys&version=0.1.4)

> *MAN* uals for *TY* p *S* t

Template for documenting [ typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) packages
and templates.

==  Usage

Just import the package at the beginning of your manual:



    #import "@preview/mantys:0.1.4": *


Mantys supports *Typst 0.11.0* and newer.

==  Writing basics

A basic template for a manual could look like this:



    #import "@local/mantys:0.1.4": *

    #import "your-package.typ"

    #show: mantys.with(
    	name:		"your-package-name",
    	title: 		[A title for the manual],
    	subtitle: 	[A subtitle for the manual],
    	info:		[A short descriptive text for the package.],
    	authors:	"Your Name",
    	url:		"https://github.com/repository/url",
    	version:	"0.0.1",
    	date:		"date-of-release",
    	abstract: 	[
    		A few paragraphs of text to describe the package.
    	],

    	example-imports: (your-package: your-package)
    )

    // end of preamble

    # About
    #lorem(50)

    # Usage
    #lorem(50)

    # Available commands
    #lorem(50)



Use ` #command(name, ..args)[description] ` to describe commands and `
#argument(name, ...)[description] ` for arguments:



    #command("headline", arg[color], arg(size:1.8em), sarg[other-args], barg[body])[
    	Renders a prominent headline using #doc("meta/heading").

    	#argument("color", type:"color")[
        The color of the headline will be used as the background of a #doc("layout/block") element containing the headline.
      ]
      #argument("size", default:1.8em)[
        The text size for the headline.
      ]
      #argument("sarg", is-sink:true)[
        Other options will get passed directly to #doc("meta/heading").
      ]
      #argument("body", type:"content")[
        The text for the headline.
      ]

      The headline is shown as a prominent colored block to highlight important news articles in the newsletter:

      #example[```
      #headline(blue, size: 2em, level: 3)[
        #lorem(8)
      ]
      ```]
    ]


The result might look something like this:

==  How to Compile

This project contains an example setup that splits individual chapters into
different files.
This can cause problems when using references etc.
These problems can be avoided by following these steps:

  - Make sure to always compile your ` main.typ ` file which includes all of your chapters for references to work correctly.
  - VSCode:

==  Acronyms

This template provides functions to reference acronyms in the text. To use
these functions, you need to define the acronyms in the ` acronyms ` attribute
of the template. The acronyms referenced with the functions below will be
linked to their definition in the list of acronyms.

===  Functions

This template provides the following functions to reference acronyms:

` acr ` : Reference an acronym in the text (e.g. ` acr("API") ` -> `
Application Programming Interface (API) ` or ` API ` )

` acrpl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in plural form (e.g. `
acrpl("API") ` -> ` Application Programming Interfaces (API) ` or ` APIs ` )

` acrs ` : Reference an acronym in the text in short form (e.g. ` acrs("API")
` -> ` API ` )

` acrspl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in short form in plural form
(e.g. ` acrpl("API") ` -> ` APIs ` )

` acrl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in long form (e.g. ` acrl("API") `
-> ` Application Programming Interface ` )

` acrlpl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in long form in plural form
(e.g. ` acrlpl("API") ` -> ` Application Programming Interfaces ` )

` acrf ` : Reference an acronym in the text in full form (e.g. ` acrf("API") `
-> ` Application Programming Interface (API) ` )

` acrfpl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in full form in plural form
(e.g. ` acrfpl("API") ` -> ` Application Programming Interfaces (API) ` )

===  Definition

To define acronyms use a dictionary and pass it to the acronyms attribute of
the template. The dictionary should contain the acronyms as keys and their
long forms as values.



    #let acronyms = (
      API: "Application Programming Interface",
      HTTP: "Hypertext Transfer Protocol",
      REST: "Representational State Transfer",
    )


To define the plural form of an acronym use a array as value with the first
element being the singular form and the second element being the plural form.
If you donât define the plural form, the template will automatically add an
âsâ to the singular form.



    #let acronyms = (
      API: ("Application Programming Interface", "Application Programming Interfaces"),
      HTTP: ("Hypertext Transfer Protocol", "Hypertext Transfer Protocols"),
      REST: ("Representational State Transfer", "Representational State Transfers"),
    )


==  Glossary

Similar to the acronyms, this template provides a function to reference
glossary terms in the text. To use the function, you need to define the
glossary terms in the ` glossary ` attribute of the template. The glossary
terms referenced with the function below will be linked to their definition in
the list of glossary terms.

===  Reference

` gls ` : Reference a glossary term in the text (e.g. ` gls("Vulnerability") `
-> link to the definition of âVulnerabilityâ in the glossary)

===  Definition

The definition works analogously to the acronyms. Define the glossary terms in
a dictionary and pass it to the glossary attribute of the template. The
dictionary should contain the glossary terms as keys and their definitions as
values.



    #let glossary = (
      Vulnerability: "A Vulnerability is a flaw in a computer system that weakens the overall security of the system.",
      Patch: "A patch is data that is intended to be used to modify an existing software resource such as a program or a file, often to fix bugs and security vulnerabilities.",
      Exploit: "An exploit is a method or piece of code that takes advantage of vulnerabilities in software, applications, networks, operating systems, or hardware, typically for malicious purposes.",
    )

Convenient Rust-like string formatting in Typst

A Typst library that brings convenient string formatting and interpolation
through the ` strfmt ` function. Its syntax is taken directly from Rustâs `
format! ` syntax, so feel free to read its page for more information ( [
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/ ](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/) );
however, this README should have enough information and examples for all
expected uses of the library. Only a few things arenât supported from the
Rust syntax, such as the ` p ` (pointer) format type, or the ` .* ` precision
specifier.

A few extras (beyond the Rust-like syntax) will be added over time, though
(feel free to drop suggestions at the repository: [
https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-oxifmt ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-
oxifmt) ). The first âextraâ so far is the ` fmt-decimal-separator:
"string" ` parameter, which lets you customize the decimal separator for
decimal numbers (floats) inserted into strings. E.g. ` strfmt("Result: {}",
5.8, fmt-decimal-separator: ",") ` will return the string ` "Result: 5,8" `
(comma instead of dot). See more below.

*Compatible with:* [ Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) v0.4.0+

==  Usage

You can use this library through Typstâs package manager (for Typst
v0.6.0+):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt


For older Typst versions, download the ` oxifmt.typ ` file either from
Releases or directly from the repository. Then, move it to your projectâs
folder, and write at the top of your Typst file(s):



    #import "oxifmt.typ": strfmt


Doing the above will give you access to the main function provided by this
library ( ` strfmt ` ), which accepts a format string, followed by zero or
more replacements to insert in that string (according to ` {...} ` formats
inserted in that string), an optional ` fmt-decimal-separator ` parameter, and
returns the formatted string, as described below.

Its syntax is almost identical to Rustâs ` format! ` (as specified here: [
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/ ](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/) ).
You can escape formats by duplicating braces ( ` {{ ` and ` }} ` become ` { `
and ` } ` ). Hereâs an example (see more examples in the file `
tests/strfmt-tests.typ ` ):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("I'm {}. I have {num} cars. I'm {0}. {} is {{cool}}.", "John", "Carl", num: 10)
    #assert.eq(s, "I'm John. I have 10 cars. I'm John. Carl is {cool}.")


Note that ` {} ` extracts positional arguments after the string sequentially
(the first ` {} ` extracts the first one, the second ` {} ` extracts the
second one, and so on), while ` {0} ` , ` {1} ` , etc. will always extract the
first, the second etc. positional arguments after the string. Additionally, `
{bananas} ` will extract the named argument âbananasâ.

===  Formatting options

You can use ` {:spec} ` to customize your output. See the Rust docs linked
above for more info, but a summary is below.

(You may also want to check out the examples at [ Examples
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oxifmt/0.2.1/#examples)
.)

  - Adding a ` ? ` at the end of ` spec ` (that is, writing e.g. ` {0:?} ` ) will call ` repr() ` to stringify your argument, instead of ` str() ` . Note that this only has an effect if your argument is a string, an integer, a float or a ` label() ` / ` <label> ` \- for all other types (such as booleans or elements), ` repr() ` is always called (as ` str() ` is unsupported for those).
    - For strings, ` ? ` (and thus ` repr() ` ) has the effect of printing them with double quotes. For floats, this ensures a ` .0 ` appears after it, even if it doesnât have decimal digits. For integers, this doesnât change anything. Finally, for labels, the ` <label> ` (with ` ? ` ) is printed as ` <label> ` instead of ` label ` .
    - *TIP:* Prefer to always use ` ? ` when youâre inserting something that isnât a string, number or label, in order to ensure consistent results even if the library eventually changes the non- ` ? ` representation.
  - After the ` : ` , add e.g. ` _<8 ` to align the string to the left, padding it with as many ` _ ` s as necessary for it to be at least ` 8 ` characters long (for example). Replace ` < ` by ` > ` for right alignment, or ` ^ ` for center alignment. (If the ` _ ` is omitted, it defaults to â â (aligns with spaces).)
    - If you prefer to specify the minimum width (the ` 8 ` there) as a separate argument to ` strfmt ` instead, you can specify ` argument$ ` in place of the width, which will extract it from the integer at ` argument ` . For example, ` _^3$ ` will center align the output with ` _ ` s, where the minimum width desired is specified by the fourth positional argument (index ` 3 ` ), as an integer. This means that a call such as ` strfmt("{:_^3$}", 1, 2, 3, 4) ` would produce ` "__1__" ` , as ` 3$ ` would evaluate to ` 4 ` (the value at the fourth positional argument/index ` 3 ` ). Similarly, ` named$ ` would take the width from the argument with name ` named ` , if it is an integer (otherwise, error).
  - *For numbers:*
    - Specify ` + ` after the ` : ` to ensure zero or positive numbers are prefixed with ` + ` before them (instead of having no sign). ` - ` is also accepted but ignored (negative numbers always specify their sign anyways).
    - Use something like ` :09 ` to add zeroes to the left of the number until it has at least 9 digits / characters.
      - The ` 9 ` here is also a width, so the same comment from before applies (you can add ` $ ` to take it from an argument to the ` strfmt ` function).
    - Use ` :.5 ` to ensure your float is represented with 5 decimal digits of precision (zeroes are added to the right if needed; otherwise, it is rounded, *not truncated* ).
      - Note that floating point inaccuracies can be sometimes observed here, which is an unfortunate current limitation.
      - Similarly to ` width ` , the precision can also be specified via an argument with the ` $ ` syntax: ` .5$ ` will take the precision from the integer at argument number 5 (the sixth one), while ` .test$ ` will take it from the argument named ` test ` .
    - *Integers only:* Add ` x ` (lowercase hex) or ` X ` (uppercase) at the end of the ` spec ` to convert the number to hexadecimal. Also, ` b ` will convert it to binary, while ` o ` will convert to octal.
      - Specify a hashtag, e.g. ` #x ` or ` #b ` , to prepend the corresponding base prefix to the base-converted number, e.g. ` 0xABC ` instead of ` ABC ` .
    - Add ` e ` or ` E ` at the end of the ` spec ` to ensure the number is represented in scientific notation (with ` e ` or ` E ` as the exponent separator, respectively).
    - For decimal numbers (floats), you can specify ` fmt-decimal-separator: "," ` to ` strfmt ` to have the decimal separator be a comma instead of a dot, for example.
      - To have this be the default, you can alias ` strfmt ` , such as using ` #let strfmt = strfmt.with(fmt-decimal-separator: ",") ` .
    - Number spec arguments (such as ` .5 ` ) are ignored when the argument is not a number, but e.g. a string, even if it looks like a number (such as ` "5" ` ).
  - Note that all spec arguments above *have to be specified in order* \- if you mix up the order, it wonât work properly!
    - Check the grammar below for the proper order, but, in summary: fill (character) with align ( ` < ` , ` > ` or ` ^ ` ) -> sign ( ` + ` or ` - ` ) -> ` # ` -> ` 0 ` (for 0 left-padding of numbers) -> width (e.g. ` 8 ` from ` 08 ` or ` 9 ` from ` -<9 ` ) -> ` .precision ` -> spec type ( ` ? ` , ` x ` , ` X ` , ` b ` , ` o ` , ` e ` , ` E ` )).

Some examples:



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s1 = strfmt("{0:?}, {test:+012e}, {1:-<#8x}", "hi", -74, test: 569.4)
    #assert.eq(s1, "\"hi\", +00005.694e2, -0x4a---")

    #let s2 = strfmt("{:_>+11.5}", 59.4)
    #assert.eq(s2, "__+59.40000")

    #let s3 = strfmt("Dict: {:!<10?}", (a: 5))
    #assert.eq(s3, "Dict: (a: 5)!!!!")


===  Examples

  - *Inserting labels, text and numbers into strings:*



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("First: {}, Second: {}, Fourth: {3}, Banana: {banana} (brackets: {{escaped}})", 1, 2.1, 3, label("four"), banana: "Banana!!")
    #assert.eq(s, "First: 1, Second: 2.1, Fourth: four, Banana: Banana!! (brackets: {escaped})")


  - *Forcing` repr() ` with ` {:?} ` * (which adds quotes around strings, and other things - basically represents a Typst value):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("The value is: {:?} | Also the label is {:?}", "something", label("label"))
    #assert.eq(s, "The value is: \"something\" | Also the label is <label>")


  - *Inserting other types than numbers and strings* (for now, they will always use ` repr() ` , even without ` {...:?} ` , although that is more explicit):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Values: {:?}, {1:?}, {stuff:?}", (test: 500), ("a", 5.1), stuff: [a])
    #assert.eq(s, "Values: (test: 500), (\"a\", 5.1), [a]")


  - *Padding to a certain width with characters:* Use ` {:x<8} ` , where ` x ` is the *character to pad with* (e.g. space or ` _ ` , but can be anything), ` < ` is the *alignment of the original text* relative to the padding (can be ` < ` for left aligned (padding goes to the right), ` > ` for right aligned (padded to its left) and ` ^ ` for center aligned (padded at both left and right)), and ` 8 ` is the *desired total width* (padding will add enough characters to reach this width; if the replacement string already has this width, no padding will be added):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Left5 {:-<5}, Right6 {:=>6}, Center10 {centered: ^10?}, Left3 {tleft:_<3}", "xx", 539, tleft: "okay", centered: [a])
    #assert.eq(s, "Left5 xx---, Right6 ===539, Center10     [a]    , Left3 okay")
    // note how 'okay' didn't suffer any padding at all (it already had at least the desired total width).


  - *Padding numbers with zeroes to the left:* Itâs a similar functionality to the above, however you write ` {:08} ` for 8 characters (for instance) - note that any characters in the numberâs representation matter for width (including sign, dot and decimal part):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Left-padded7 numbers: {:07} {:07} {:07} {3:07}", 123, -344, 44224059, 45.32)
    #assert.eq(s, "Left-padded7 numbers: 0000123 -000344 44224059 0045.32")


  - *Defining padding-to width using parameters, not literals:* If you want the desired replacement width (the ` 8 ` in ` {:08} ` or ` {: ^8} ` ) to be passed via parameter (instead of being hardcoded into the format string), you can specify ` parameter$ ` in place of the width, e.g. ` {:02$} ` to take it from the third positional parameter, or ` {:a>banana$} ` to take it from the parameter named ` banana ` \- note that the chosen parameter *must be an integer* (desired total width):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Padding depending on parameter: {0:02$} and {0:a>banana$}", 432, 0, 5, banana: 9)
    #assert.eq(s, "Padding depending on parameter: 00432 aaaaaa432")  // widths 5 and 9


  - *Displaying` + ` on positive numbers: * Just add a ` + ` at the âbeginningâ, i.e., before the ` #0 ` (if either is there), or after the custom fill and align (if itâs there and not ` 0 ` \- see [ Grammar ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oxifmt/0.2.1/#grammar) for the exact positioning), like so:



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Some numbers: {:+} {:+08}; With fill and align: {:_<+8}; Negative (no-op): {neg:+}", 123, 456, 4444, neg: -435)
    #assert.eq(s, "Some numbers: +123 +0000456; With fill and align: +4444___; Negative (no-op): -435")



  - *Converting numbers to bases 2, 8 and 16:* Use one of the following specifier types (i.e., characters which always go at the very end of the format): ` b ` (binary), ` o ` (octal), ` x ` (lowercase hexadecimal) or ` X ` (uppercase hexadecimal). You can also add a ` # ` between ` + ` and ` 0 ` (see the exact position at the [ Grammar ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oxifmt/0.2.1/#grammar) ) to display a *base prefix* before the number (i.e. ` 0b ` for binary, ` 0o ` for octal and ` 0x ` for hexadecimal):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Bases (10, 2, 8, 16(l), 16(U):) {0} {0:b} {0:o} {0:x} {0:X} | W/ prefixes and modifiers: {0:#b} {0:+#09o} {0:_>+#9X}", 124)
    #assert.eq(s, "Bases (10, 2, 8, 16(l), 16(U):) 124 1111100 174 7c 7C | W/ prefixes and modifiers: 0b1111100 +0o000174 ____+0x7C")


  - *Picking float precision (right-extending with zeroes):* Add, at the end of the format (just before the spec type (such as ` ? ` ), if thereâs any), either ` .precision ` (hardcoded, e.g. ` .8 ` for 8 decimal digits) or ` .parameter$ ` (taking the precision value from the specified parameter, like with ` width ` ):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("{0:.8} {0:.2$} {0:.potato$}", 1.234, 0, 2, potato: 5)
    #assert.eq(s, "1.23400000 1.23 1.23400")


  - *Scientific notation:* Use ` e ` (lowercase) or ` E ` (uppercase) as specifier types (can be combined with precision):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("{0:e} {0:E} {0:+.9e} | {1:e} | {2:.4E}", 124.2312, 50, -0.02)
    #assert.eq(s, "1.242312e2 1.242312E2 +1.242312000e2 | 5e1 | -2.0000E-2")


  - *Customizing the decimal separator on floats:* Just specify ` fmt-decimal-separator: "," ` (comma as an example):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("{0} {0:.6} {0:.5e}", 1.432, fmt-decimal-separator: ",")
    #assert.eq(s, "1,432 1,432000 1,43200e0")


===  Grammar

Hereâs the grammar specification for valid format ` spec ` s (in `
{name:spec} ` ), which is basically Rustâs format:



    format_spec := [[fill]align][sign]['#']['0'][width]['.' precision]type
    fill := character
    align := '<' | '^' | '>'
    sign := '+' | '-'
    width := count
    precision := count | '*'
    type := '' | '?' | 'x?' | 'X?' | identifier
    count := parameter | integer
    parameter := argument '$'


Note, however, that precision of type ` .* ` is not supported yet and will
raise an error.

==  Issues and Contributing

==  Changelog

===  v0.2.1

  - Fixed formatting of UTF-8 strings. Before, strings with multi-byte UTF-8 codepoints would cause formatting inconsistencies or even crashes. ( [ Issue #6 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-oxifmt/issues/6) )
  - Fixed an inconsistency in negative number formatting. Now, it will always print a regular hyphen (e.g. â-2â), which is consistent with Rustâs behavior; before, it would occasionally print a minus sign instead (as observed in a comment to [ Issue #4 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-oxifmt/issues/4) ).
  - Added compatibility with Typst 0.8.0âs new type system.

===  v0.2.0

  - The packageâs name is now ` oxifmt ` !
  - ` oxifmt:0.2.0 ` is now available through Typstâs Package Manager! You can now write ` #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.0": strfmt ` to use the library.
  - Greatly improved the README, adding a section for common examples.
  - Fixed negative numbers being formatted with two minus signs.
  - Fixed custom precision of floats not working when they are exact integers.

===  v0.1.0

  - Initial release, added ` strfmt ` .

=  zen-zine

0.1.0

Excellently type-set a fun little zine!

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=zen-zine&version=0.1.0)

Excellently type-set a cute little zine about your favorite topic!

Providing your eight pages in order will produce a US-Letter page with the
content in a layout ready to be folded into a zine! The content is wrapped
before movement so that padding and alignment are respected.

Here is the template and its preview:



    #import "@preview/zen-zine:0.1.0": zine

    #set document(author: "Tom", title: "Zen Zine Example")
    #set text(font: "Linux Libertine", lang: "en")

    #let my_eight_pages = (
      range(8).map(
        number => [
          #pad(2em, text(10em, align(center, str(number))))
        ]
      )
    )

    // provide your content pages in order and they
    // are placed into the zine template positions.
    // the content is wrapped before movement so that
    // padding and alignment are respected.
    #zine(
      // draw_border: true,
      // zine_page_margin: 5pt,
      contents: my_eight_pages
    )


![Image of
Template](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/zen-
zine/0.1.0/template/preview.png)

==  Improvement Ideas

Roughly in order of priority.

  - Write documentation and generate a manual
  - Deduce ` page ` properties so that user can change the page they wish to use.
    - Make sure the page is ` flipped ` and deduce the zine page width and height from the full page width and height (and the zine margin)
    - Iâm currently struggling with finding out the page properties (whatâs the ` #get ` equivalent to ` #set ` ?)
  - Add other zine sizes (there is a 16 page one I believe?)
  - Digital mode where zine pages are separate pages (of the same size) rather than âsub pagesâ of a printer page

==  Usage

Call ` minideck.config ` to get the functions you want to use:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide, title-slide, pause, uncover, only) = minideck.config()
    #show: template

    #title-slide[
      = Slides with `minideck`
      == Some examples
      John Doe

      #datetime.today().display()
    ]

    #slide[
      = Some title

      Some content

      #show: pause

      More content

      1. One
      2. Two
      #show: pause
      3. Three
    ]


This will show three subslides with progressively more content. (Note that the
default theme uses the font Libertinus Sans from the [ Libertinus
](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus) family, so you may want to install
it.)

Instead of ` #show: pause ` , you can use ` #uncover(2,3)[...] ` to make
content visible only on subslides 2 and 3, or ` #uncover(from: 2)[...] ` to
have it visible on subslide 2 and following.

The ` only ` function is similar to ` uncover ` , but instead of hiding the
content (without affecting the layout), it removes it.



    #slide[
      = `uncover` and `only`

      #uncover(1, from:3)[
        Content visible on subslides 1 and 3+
        (space reserved on 2).
      ]

      #only(2,3)[
        Content included on subslides 2 and 3
        (no space reserved on 1).
      ]

      Content always visible.
    ]


Contrary to ` pause ` , the ` uncover ` and ` only ` functions also work in
math mode:



    #slide[
      = Dynamic equation

      $
        f(x) &= x^2 + 2x + 1  \
             #uncover(2, $&= (x + 1)^2$)
      $
    ]


When mixing ` pause ` with ` uncover ` / ` only ` , the sequence of pauses
should be taken as reference for the meaning of subslide indices. For example
content after the first pause always appears on the second subslide, even if
itâs preceded by a call to ` #uncover(from: 3)[...] ` .

The package also works well with [ pinit
](https://typst.app/universe/package/pinit) :



    #import "@preview/pinit:0.1.4": *

    #slide[
      = Works well with `pinit`

      Pythagorean theorem:

      $ #pin(1)a^2#pin(2) + #pin(3)b^2#pin(4) = #pin(5)c^2#pin(6) $

      #show: pause

      $a^2$ and $b^2$ : squares of triangle legs

      #only(2, {
        pinit-highlight(1,2)
        pinit-highlight(3,4)
      })

      #show: pause

      $c^2$ : square of hypotenuse

      #pinit-highlight(5,6, fill: green.transparentize(80%))
      #pinit-point-from(6)[larger than $a^2$ and $b^2$]
    ]


===  Handout mode

minideck can make a handout version of the document, in which dynamic behavior
is disabled: the content of all subslides is shown together in a single slide.

To compile a handout version, pass ` --input handout=true ` in the command
line:



    typst compile --input handout=true myfile.typ


It is also possible to enable handout mode from within the document, as shown
in the next section.

===  Configuration

The behavior of the minideck functions depends on the settings passed to `
minideck.config ` . For example, handout mode can also be enabled like this:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide, pause) = minideck.config(handout: true)
    #show: template

    #slide[
      = Slide title

      Some text

      #show: pause

      More text
    ]


(The default value of ` handout ` is ` auto ` , in which case minideck checks
for a command line setting as in the previous section.)

` minideck.config ` accepts the following named arguments:

  - ` paper ` : a string for one of the paper size names recognized by [ ` page.paper ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-paper) , or one of the shorthands ` "16:9" ` or ` "4:3" ` . Default: ` "4:3" ` .
  - ` landscape ` : use the paper size in landscape orientation. Default: ` true ` .
  - ` width ` : page width as an absolute length. Takes precedence over ` paper ` and ` landscape ` .
  - ` height ` : page height as an absolute length. Takes precedence over ` paper ` and ` landscape ` .
  - ` handout ` : whether to make a document for handout, with content of all subslides shown together in a single slide.
  - ` theme ` : the theme (see below).
  - ` cetz ` : the CeTZ module (see below).
  - ` fletcher ` : the fletcher module (see below).

For example to make slides with 16:9 aspect ratio, use `
minideck.config(paper: "16:9") ` .

===  Themes

Use ` minideck.config(theme: ...) ` to select a theme. Currently there is only
one built-in: ` minideck.themes.simple ` . However you can also pass a theme
implemented by yourself or from a third-party package. See the [ theme
documentation
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/minideck/0.2.1/themes/README.md)
for how that works.

Themes are functions and can be configured using the standard [ ` with `
method ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/#definitions-
with) :

  - The ` simple ` theme has a ` variant ` setting with values âlightâ (default) and âdarkâ.

Hereâs an example:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide) = minideck.config(
      theme: minideck.themes.simple.with(variant: "dark"),
    )
    #show: template

    #slide[
      = Slide with dark theme

      Some text
    ]


Note that you can override part of a theme with show and set rules:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide) = minideck.config(
      theme: minideck.themes.simple.with(variant: "dark"),
    )
    #show: template

    #set page(footer: none) // get rid of the page number
    #show heading: it => text(style: "italic", it)
    #set text(red)

    #slide[
      = Slide with dark theme and red text

      Some text
    ]


===  Integration with CeTZ

You can use ` uncover ` and ` only ` (but not ` pause ` ) in CeTZ figures,
with the following extra steps:

  - Get CeTZ-specific functions ` cetz-uncover ` and ` cetz-only ` by passing the CeTZ module to ` minideck.config ` (see example below).

This ensures that minideck uses CeTZ functions from the correct version of
CeTZ.

  - Add a ` context ` keyword outside the ` canvas ` call.

This is required to access the minideck subslide state from within the canvas
without making the content opaque (CeTZ needs to inspect the canvas content to
make the drawing).

Example:



    #import "@preview/cetz:0.2.2" as cetz: *
    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide, only, cetz-uncover, cetz-only) = minideck.config(cetz: cetz)
    #show: template

    #slide[
      = In a CeTZ figure

      Above canvas
      #context canvas({
        import draw: *
        cetz-only(3, rect((0,-2), (14,4), stroke: 3pt))
        cetz-uncover(from: 2, rect((0,-2), (16,2), stroke: blue+3pt))
        content((8,0), box(stroke: red+3pt, inset: 1em)[
          A typst box #only(2)[on 2nd subslide]
        ])
      })
      Below canvas
    ]


===  Integration with fletcher

The same steps are required as for CeTZ integration (passing the fletcher
module to get fletcher-specific functions), plus an additional step:

  - Give explicitly the number of subslides to the ` slide ` function.

This is required because I could not find a reliable way to update a typst
state from within a fletcher diagram, so I cannot rely on the state to keep
track of the number of subslides.

Example:



    #import "@preview/fletcher:0.5.0" as fletcher: diagram, node, edge
    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"
    #let (template, slide, fletcher-uncover) = minideck.config(fletcher: fletcher)
    #show: template

    #slide(steps: 2)[
      = In a fletcher diagram

      #set align(center)

      Above diagram

      #context diagram(
        node-stroke: 1pt,
        node((0,0), [Start], corner-radius: 2pt, extrude: (0, 3)),
        edge("-|>"),
        node((1,0), align(center)[A]),
        fletcher-uncover(from: 2, edge("d,r,u,l", "-|>", [x], label-pos: 0.1))
      )

      Below diagram
    ]


==  Comparison with other slides packages

Performance: minideck is currently faster than [ Polylux
](https://typst.app/universe/package/polylux/) when using ` pause ` ,
especially for incremental compilation, but a bit slower than [ Touying
](https://typst.app/universe/package/touying) , according to my tests.

Features: Polylux and Touying have more themes and more features, for example
support for [ pdfpc ](https://pdfpc.github.io/) which provides speaker notes
and more. Minideck allows using ` uncover ` and ` only ` in CeTZ figures and
fletcher diagrams, which Polylux currently doesnât support.

Syntax: package configuration is simpler in minideck than Touying but a bit
more involved than in Polylux. The minideck ` pause ` is more cumbersome to
use: one must write ` #show: pause ` instead of ` #pause ` . On the other hand
minideckâs ` uncover ` and ` only ` can be used directly in equations
without requiring a special math environment as in Touying (I think).

Other: minideck sometimes has better error messages than Touying due to
implementation differences: the minideck stack trace points back to the
userâs code while Touying errors sometimes point only to an output page
number.

==  Limitations

  - ` pause ` , ` uncover ` and ` only ` work in enumerations but they require explicit enum indices ( ` 1. ... ` rather than ` + ... ` ) as they cause a reset of the list index.
  - Usage in a CeTZ canvas or fletcher diagram requires a ` context ` keyword in front of the ` canvas ` / ` diagram ` call (see above).
  - fletcher diagrams also require to specify the number of subslides explicitly (see above).
  - ` pause ` doesnât work in CeTZ figures, fletcher diagrams and math mode.
  - ` pause ` requires writing ` #show: pause ` and its effect is lost after the ` #show ` call goes out of scope. For example this means that one can use ` pause ` inside of a grid, but further ` pause ` calls after the grid (in the same slide) wonât work as intended.

==  Internals

The package uses states with the following keys:

` __minideck-subslide-count ` : an array of two integers for counting pauses
and keeping track of the subslide number automatically. The first value is the
number of subslides so far referenced in current slide. The second value is
the number of pauses seen so far in the current slide. Both values are kept in
one state so that an update function can update the number of subslides based
on the number of pauses, without requiring a context. This avoids problems
with layout convergence.

` __minideck-subslide-step ` : the current subslide being generated while
processing a slide.

= *ez-today.md*

=  ez-today

0.1.0

Simply displays the full current date.

Simply displays the current date with easy to use customization.

==  Included languages

German, English, French and Italian months can be used out of the box. If you
want to use a language that is not included, you can easily add it yourself.
This is shown in the customization section below.

==  Usage

The usage is very simple, because there is only the ` today() ` function.



    #import "@preview/ez-today:0.1.0"

    // To get the current date use this
    #ez-today.today()


==  Reference

===  ` today `

Prints the current date with given arguments.



    #let today(
      lang: "de",
      format: "d. M Y",
      custom-months: ()
    ) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` lang ` : [ ` str ` ] â Select one of the included languages (de, en, fr, it).
  - ` format ` : [ ` str ` ] â Specify the output format.
  - ` custom-months ` : [ ` array ` ] of [ ` str ` ] â Use custom names for each month. This array must have 12 entries. If this is used, the ` lang ` argument does nothing.

==  Customization

The default output prints the full current date with German months like this:



    #ez-today.today()   // 11. Oktober 2024


You can choose one of the included languages with the ` lang ` argument:



    #ez-today.today(lang: "en")   // 11. October 2024
    #ez-today.today(lang: "fr")   // 11. Octobre 2024
    #ez-today.today(lang: "it")   // 11. Ottobre 2024


You can also change the format of the output with the ` format ` argument.
Pass any string you want here, but know that the following characters will be
replaced with the following:

  - ` d ` â The current day as a decimal
  - ` m ` â The current month as a decimal ( ` lang ` argument does nothing)
  - ` M ` â The current month as a string with either the selected language or the custom array
  - ` y ` â The current year as a decimal with the last two numbers
  - ` Y ` â The current year as a decimal

Here are some examples:



    #ez-today.today(lang: "en", format: "M d Y")    // October 11 2024
    #ez-today.today(format: "m-d-y")                // 10-11-24
    #ez-today.today(format: "d/m")                  // 11/10
    #ez-today.today(format: "d.m.Y")                // 11.10.2024


Use the ` custom-months ` argument to give each month a custom name. You can
add a new language or use short terms for each month.



    // Defining some custom names
    #let my-months = ("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
    // Get current date with custom names
    #ez-today.today(custom-months: my-months, format: "M-y")    // Oct-24


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` ez-today `



    #import "@preview/ez-today:0.1.0"

==  Documentation

===  ` card `

Defines a card by updating the below ` counter ` and ` state ` (s), and
dropping a label.



    #let card(header, footer, question, answer) = [
      #cardnumber.step()
      #cardheader.update(header)
      #cardfooter.update(footer)
      #cardquestion.update(question)
      #cardanswer.update(answer)
      <card>
    ]


====  Arguments

  - ` header `
  - ` footer `
  - ` question `
  - ` answer `

===  card builders

*How they work*

  1. Find all locations of the ` <card> ` label
  2. Get the values of the ` cardnumber ` counter, and ` cardheader ` , ` cardfooter ` , ` cardquestion ` , ` cardanswer ` states at each ` <card> ` .
  3. Populates an array of questions and an array of answers using these values
     - The ` #a48up ` and ` #letter8up ` functions describe the layout of each card for each item in these arrays, and also rearrange the answers so that the layout makes sense when printed double sided.
  4. Loop over the arrays and dump each itemâs ` content ` onto the page.
     - in the case of ` #a48up ` and ` letter8up ` , each item is dumped into a 2-column table.

` cartao ` comes builtin with the following card building functions. Take a
look at the source for how they work, and use them as a guide to help you
build your own flashcards with different sizes/formats.

===  ` a48up `

Produces a 2x8 portrait card layout on a4 paper.

Designed to be printed double-sided on the perforated 8-up a4 card paper you
can find on [ Amazon
](https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=a4+perforated+card&crid=37RT2L4H5XSD0&sprefix=a4+perforated+ca%2Caps%2C648&ref=nb_sb_noss)

======  Usage

0.1.0

Easy, composable tabular data manipulation

TaDa provides a set of simple but powerful operations on rows of data. A full
manual is available online: [ https://github.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/blob/v0.1.0/docs/manual.pdf ](https://github.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/blob/v0.1.0/docs/manual.pdf)

Key features include:

  - *Arithmetic expressions* : Row-wise operations are as simple as string expressions with field names

  - *Aggregation* : Any function that operates on an array of values can perform row-wise or column-wise aggregation

  - *Data representation* : Handle displaying currencies, floats, integers, and more with ease and arbitrary customization

Note: This library is in early development. The API is subject to change
especially as typst adds more support for user-defined types. *Backwards
compatibility is not guaranteed!* Handling of field info, value types, and
more may change substantially with more user feedback.

==  Importing

TaDa can be imported as follows:

===  From the official packages repository (recommended):



    #import "@preview/tada:0.1.0"


===  From the source code (not recommended)

*Option 1:* You can clone the package directly into your project directory:



    # In your project directory
    git clone https://github.com/ntjess/typst-tada.git tada


Then import the functionality with



    #import "./tada/lib.typ"


*Option 2:* If Python is available on your system, use the provided
packaging script to install TaDa in typstâs ` local ` directory:



    # Anywhere on your system
      git clone https://github.com/ntjess/typst-tada.git
      cd typst-tada

      # Replace $XDG_CACHE_HOME with the appropriate directory based on
      # https://github.com/typst/packages#downloads
      python package.py ./typst.toml "$XDG_CACHE_HOME/typst/packages" \
        --namespace local



Now, TaDa is available under the local namespace:



    #import "@local/tada:0.1.0"


==  Creation

TaDa provides three main ways to construct tables â from columns, rows, or
records.

  - *Columns* are a dictionary of field names to column values. Alternatively, a 2D array of columns can be passed to ` from-columns ` , where ` values.at(0) ` is a column (belongs to one field).

  - *Records* are a 1D array of dictionaries where each dictionary is a row.

  - *Rows* are a 2D array where ` values.at(0) ` is a row (has one value for each field). Note that if ` rows ` are given without field names, they default to (0, 1, â¦$n$).



    #let column-data = (
      name: ("Bread", "Milk", "Eggs"),
      price: (1.25, 2.50, 1.50),
      quantity: (2, 1, 3),
    )
    #let record-data = (
      (name: "Bread", price: 1.25, quantity: 2),
      (name: "Milk", price: 2.50, quantity: 1),
      (name: "Eggs", price: 1.50, quantity: 3),
    )
    #let row-data = (
      ("Bread", 1.25, 2),
      ("Milk", 2.50, 1),
      ("Eggs", 1.50, 3),
    )

    #import tada: TableData
    #let td = TableData(data: column-data)
    // Equivalent to:
    #let td2 = tada.from-records(record-data)
    // _Not_ equivalent to (since field names are unknown):
    #let td3 = tada.from-rows(row-data)

    #to-tablex(td)
    #to-tablex(td2)
    #to-tablex(td3)


![Example 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-01.png)

==  Title formatting

You can pass any ` content ` as a fieldâs ` title ` . *Note* : if you pass
a string, it will be evaluated as markup.



    #let fmt(it) = {
      heading(outlined: false,
        upper(it.at(0))
        + it.slice(1).replace("_", " ")
      )
    }

    #let titles = (
      // As a function
      name: (title: fmt),
      // As a string
      quantity: (title: fmt("Qty")),
    )
    #let td = TableData(..td, field-info: titles)

    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-02.png)

==  Adapting default behavior

You can specify defaults for any field not explicitly populated by passing
information to ` field-defaults ` . Observe in the last example that ` price `
was not given a title. We can indicate it should be formatted the same as `
name ` by passing ` title: fmt ` to ` field-defaults ` . *Note* that any
field that is explicitly given a value will not be affected by ` field-
defaults ` (i.e., ` quantity ` will retain its string title âQtyâ)



    #let defaults = (title: fmt)
    #let td = TableData(..td, field-defaults: defaults)
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-03.png)

==  Using ` __index `

TaDa will automatically add an ` __index ` field to each row that is hidden by
default. If you want it displayed, update its information to set ` hide: false
` :



    // Use the helper function `update-fields` to update multiple fields
    // and/or attributes
    #import tada: update-fields
    #let td = update-fields(
      td, __index: (hide: false, title: "\#")
    )
    // You can also insert attributes directly:
    // #td.field-info.__index.insert("hide", false)
    // etc.
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-04.png)

==  Value formatting

===  ` type `

Type information can have attached metadata that specifies alignment, display
formats, and more. Available types and their metadata are:

  - *string* : (default-value: "", align: left)

  - *content* : (display: , align: left)

  - *float* : (align: right)

  - *integer* : (align: right)

  - *percent* : (display: , align: right)

  - *index* : (align: right)

While adding your own default types is not yet supported, you can simply
defined a dictionary of specifications and pass its keys to the field



    #let currency-info = (
      display: tada.display.format-usd, align: right
    )
    #td.field-info.insert("price", (type: "currency"))
    #let td = TableData(..td, type-info: ("currency": currency-info))
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-05.png)

==  Transposing

` transpose ` is supported, but keep in mind if columns have different types,
an error will be a frequent result. To avoid the error, explicitly pass `
ignore-types: true ` . You can choose whether to keep field names as an
additional column by passing a string to ` fields-name ` that is evaluated as
markup:



    #to-tablex(
      tada.transpose(
        td, ignore-types: true, fields-name: ""
      )
    )


![Example 6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-06.png)

===  ` display `

If your type is not available or you want to customize its display, pass a `
display ` function that formats the value, or a string that accesses ` value `
in its scope:



    #td.field-info.at("quantity").insert(
      "display",
      val => ("/", "One", "Two", "Three").at(val),
    )

    #let td = TableData(..td)
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-07.png)

===  ` align ` etc.

You can pass ` align ` and ` width ` to a given fieldâs metadata to
determine how content aligns in the cell and how much horizontal space it
takes up. In the future, more ` tablex ` setup arguments will be accepted.



    #let adjusted = update-fields(
      td, name: (align: center, width: 1.4in)
    )
    #to-tablex(adjusted)


![Example 8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-08.png)

==  Deeper ` tablex ` customization

TaDa uses ` tablex ` to display the table. So any argument that ` tablex `
accepts can be passed to TableData as well:



    #let mapper = (index, row) => {
      let fill = if index == 0 {rgb("#8888")} else {none}
      row.map(cell => (..cell, fill: fill))
    }
    #let td = TableData(
      ..td,
      tablex-kwargs: (
        map-rows: mapper, auto-vlines: false
      ),
    )
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-09.png)

==  Subselection

You can select a subset of fields or rows to display:



    #import tada: subset
    #to-tablex(
      subset(td, indexes: (0,2), fields: ("name", "price"))
    )


![Example 10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-10.png)

Note that ` indexes ` is based on the tableâs ` __index ` column, _not_
itâs positional index within the table:



    #let td2 = td
    #td2.data.insert("__index", (1, 2, 2))
    #to-tablex(
      subset(td2, indexes: 2, fields: ("__index", "name"))
    )


![Example 11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-11.png)

Rows can also be selected by whether they fulfill a field condition:



    #to-tablex(
      tada.filter(td, expression: "price < 1.5")
    )


![Example 12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-12.png)

==  Concatenation

Concatenating rows and columns are both supported operations, but only in the
simple sense of stacking the data. Currently, there is no ability to join on a
field or otherwise intelligently merge data.

  - ` axis: 0 ` places new rows below current rows

  - ` axis: 1 ` places new columns to the right of current columns

  - Unless you specify a fill value for missing values, the function will panic if the tables do not match exactly along their concatenation axis.

  - You cannot stack with ` axis: 1 ` unless every column has a unique field name.



    #import tada: stack

    #let td2 = TableData(
      data: (
        name: ("Cheese", "Butter"),
        price: (2.50, 1.75),
      )
    )
    #let td3 = TableData(
      data: (
        rating: (4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5),
      )
    )

    // This would fail without specifying the fill
    // since `quantity` is missing from `td2`
    #let stack-a = stack(td, td2, missing-fill: 0)
    #let stack-b = stack(stack-a, td3, axis: 1)
    #to-tablex(stack-b)


![Example 13](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-13.png)

==  Expressions

The easiest way to leverage TaDaâs flexibility is through expressions. They
can be strings that treat field names as variables, or functions that take
keyword-only arguments.

  - *Note* ! When passing functions, every field is passed as a named argument to the function. So, make sure to capture unused fields with ` ..rest ` (the name is unimportant) to avoid errors.



    #let make-dict(field, expression) = {
      let out = (:)
      out.insert(
        field,
        (expression: expression, type: "currency"),
      )
      out
    }

    #let td = update-fields(
      td, ..make-dict("total", "price * quantity" )
    )

    #let tax-expr(total: none, ..rest) = { total * 0.2 }
    #let taxed = update-fields(
      td, ..make-dict("tax", tax-expr),
    )

    #to-tablex(
      subset(taxed, fields: ("name", "total", "tax"))
    )


![Example 14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-14.png)

==  Chaining

It is inconvenient to require several temporary variables as above, or deep
function nesting, to perform multiple operations on a table. TaDa provides a `
chain ` function to make this easier. Furthermore, when you need to compute
several fields at once and donât need extra field information, you can use `
add-expressions ` as a shorthand:



    #import tada: chain, add-expressions
    #let totals = chain(td,
      add-expressions.with(
        total: "price * quantity",
        tax: "total * 0.2",
        after-tax: "total + tax",
      ),
      subset.with(
        fields: ("name", "total", "after-tax")
      ),
      // Add type information
      update-fields.with(
        after-tax: (type: "currency", title: fmt("w/ Tax")),
      ),
    )
    #to-tablex(totals)


![Example 15](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-15.png)

==  Sorting

You can sort by ascending/descending values of any field, or provide your own
transformation function to the ` key ` argument to customize behavior further:



    #import tada: sort-values
    #to-tablex(sort-values(
      td, by: "quantity", descending: true
    ))


![Example 16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-16.png)

==  Aggregation

Column-wise reduction is supported through ` agg ` , using either functions or
string expressions:



    #import tada: agg, item
    #let grand-total = chain(
      totals,
      agg.with(after-tax: array.sum),
      // use "item" to extract exactly one element
      item
    )
    // "Output" is a helper function just for these docs.
    // It is not necessary in your code.
    #output[
      *Grand total: #tada.display.format-usd(grand-total)*
    ]


![Example 17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-17.png)

It is also easy to aggregate several expressions at once:



    #let agg-exprs = (
      "# items": "quantity.sum()",
      "Longest name": "[#name.sorted(key: str.len).at(-1)]",
    )
    #let agg-td = tada.agg(td, ..agg-exprs)
    #to-tablex(agg-td)


![Example 18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-18.png)

Numeric Typst

==  Numty

===  Numeric Typst

A library for performing mathematical operations on n-dimensional matrices,
vectors/arrays, and numbers in Typst, with support for broadcasting and
handling NaN values. Numtyâs broadcasting rules and API are inspired by
NumPy.



    #import "numty.typ" as nt

    // Define vectors and matrices
    #let a = (1, 2, 3)
    #let b = 2
    #let m = ((1, 2), (1, 3))

    // Element-wise operations with broadcasting
    #nt.mult(a, b)  // Multiply vector 'a' by scalar 'b': (2, 4, 6)
    #nt.add(a, a)   // Add two vectors: (2, 4, 6)
    #nt.add(2, a)   // Add scalar '2' to each element of vector 'a': (3, 4, 5)
    #nt.add(m, 1)   // Add scalar '1' to each element of matrix 'm': ((2, 3), (2, 4))

    // Dot product of vectors
    #nt.dot(a, a)   // Dot product of vector 'a' with itself: 14

    // Handling NaN cases in mathematical functions
    #calc.sin((3, 4)) // Fails, as Typst does not support vector operations directly
    #nt.sin((3.4))    // Sine of each element in vector: (0.14411, 0.90929)

    // Generate equally spaced values and vectorized functions
    #let x = nt.linspace(0, 10, 3)  // Generate 3 equally spaced values between 0 and 10: (0, 5, 10)
    #let y = nt.sin(x)              // Apply sine function to each element: (0, -0.95, -0.54)

    // Logical operations
    #nt.eq(a, b)      // Compare each element in 'a' to 'b': (false, true, false)
    #nt.any(nt.eq(a, b)) // Check if any element in 'a' equals 'b': true
    #nt.all(nt.eq(a, b)) // Check if all elements in 'a' equal 'b': false

    // Handling special cases like division by zero
    #nt.div((1, 3), (2, 0))  // Element-wise division, with NaN for division by zero: (0.5, float.nan)

    // Matrix operations (element-wise)
    #nt.add(m, 1)  // Add scalar to matrix elements: ((2, 3), (2, 4))

    // matrix
    #nt.transpose(m)  // transposition
    #nt.matmul(m,m) //  matrix multipliation
    #nt.matmul(c(1,2), r(2,3)) //  colum vector times row vector multiplication.
    #np.trace(m) // trace
    #np.det(m) /2x2 determinant

    // printing
    #nt.print(m, " != " , (1,2))  // long dollar print, see in pdf
    #nt.p(m, " != " , (1,2))  //  short long print print, see in pdf


Since vesion 0.0.4 n-dim matrices are supported as well in most operations.

==  Supported Features:

===  Dimensions:

Numty uses standard typst list as a base type, most 1d operations like dot are
suported directly for them.

For matrix specific operations we use 2d arrays / nested arrays, that are also
the standard typst list, but nested like in: ((1,2), (1,1)).

For convenience you can create column or row vectors with the #nt.c and #nt.r
functions.



    #import "numty.typ" as nt
    #import "numty.typ": c, r

    #let a = (1,2,3)
    #let b = (3,2,1)
    #c(..a) // ((1,),(2,),(3,))
    #r(..b) // ((3,2,1),)
    #nt.matmul(c(..a), r(..b)) // column @ row



===  Logic Operations:



    #let a = (1,2,3)
    #let b = 2

    #nt.eq(a,b)  // (false, true, false)
    #nt.all(nt.eq(a,b))  // false
    #nt.any(nt.eq(a,b))  // true


===  Math operators:

All operators are element-wise, traditional matrix multiplication is not yet
supported.



    #nt.add((0,1,3), 1)  // (1,2,4)
    #nt.mult((1,3),(2,2)) // (2,6)
    #nt.div((1,3), (2,0)) // (0.5,float.nan)


===  Algebra with Nan handling:



    #nt.log((0,1,3)) //  (float.nan, 0 , 0.47...)
    #nt.sin((1,3)) //  (0.84.. , 0.14...)


===  Vector operations:

Basic vector operations



    #nt.dot((1,2),(2,4))  //  9
    #nt.normalize((1,4), l:1) // (1/5,4/5)


===  Others:

Functions for creating equally spaced indexes in linear and logspace, usefull
for log plots, to sample in acordance to the logarithmic space.



    #nt.linspace(0,10,3) // (0,5,10)
    #nt.logspace(1,3,3)
    #nt.geomspace(1,3,3)


===  Matrix



    #nt.matmul(m,m )              // matrix multiplication
    #nt.det(((1,3), (3,4)))       // only 2x2 supported for now
    #nt.trace(((1,3), (3,4)))     // trace of square matrix
    #nt.transpose(((1,3), (3,4))) // matrix transposition


===  Printing

Numty supports $ printing to the pdf of numerical matrices, both long and
short format.



    #nt.print((1,2),(4,2)))  // to display in the pdf
    #nt.p((1,2),(4,2)), " random string ")     // to display in the pdf


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` numty `

Time to kill? Search for words in a box of letters!

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=cereal-words&version=0.1.0)

Oh no, the Typst guys jumbled the letters! Bring order into this mess by
finding the hidden words.

This small game is playable in the Typst editor and best enjoyed with the web
app or ` typst watch ` . It was first released for the 24 Days to Christmas
campaign in winter of 2023.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` cereal-words ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/cereal-words


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` game ` function, which accepts a single positional
argument for the game input.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` game `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/cereal-words:0.1.0": game

==  Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on the
typst web app.



    #import "@preview/flyingcircus:3.2.0": *

    #show: FlyingCircus.with(
      Title: title,
      Author: author,
      CoverImg: image("images/cover.png"),
      Dedication: [It's Alive!!! MUAHAHAHA!],
    )

    #FCPlane(read("My Plane_stats.json"), Nickname:"My First Plane")


==  Usage

The first thing is the FlyingCircus style.



    #import "@preview/flyingcircus:3.2.0": *

    /// Defines the FlyingCircus template
    ///
    /// - Title (str): Title of the document. Goes in metadata and on title page.
    /// - Author (str): Author(s) of the document. Goes in metadata and on title page.
    /// - CoverImg (image): Image to make the first page of the document.
    /// - Description (str): Text to go with the title on the title page.
    /// - Dedication (str): Dedication to go down below the title on the title page.
    /// - body (content)
    /// -> content

    // Example
    #show: FlyingCircus.with(
      Title: title,
      Author: author,
      CoverImg: image("images/cover.png"),
      Dedication: [It's Alive!!! MUAHAHAHA!],
    )


Next is the FCPlane function for making plane pages.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Plane page.  Always on a new page. Image optional.
    ///
    /// - Plane (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the plane stats.
    /// - Nickname (str): Nickname to go under the aircraft name.
    /// - Img (image | none): Image to go at the top of the page. Set to none to remove.
    /// - BoxText (dictionary): Pairs of values to go in the box over the image. Does nothing if no Img provided.
    /// - BoxAnchor (str): Which anchor of the image to put the box in?  Sample values are "north", "south-west", "center".
    /// - DescriptiveText (content)
    /// -> content


    // Example
    #FCPlane(
      read("Basic Biplane_stats.json"),
      Nickname: "Bring home the bacon!",
      Img: image("images/Bergziegel_image.png"),
      BoxText: ("Role": "Fast Bomber", "First Flight": "1601", "Strengths": "Fastest Bomber"),
      BoxAnchor: "north-east",
    )[
    #lorem(100)
    ]


The FCVehicleSimple is for when you want to put multiple vehicles on a page.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Simple Vehicle.  Not always a full page. Image optional.
    ///
    /// - Vehicle (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the Vehicle stats.
    /// - Img (image): Image to go above the vehicle. (optional)
    /// - DescriptiveText (content)
    /// -> content
    #FCVehicleSimple(read("Sample Vehicle_stats.json"))[#lorem(120)]


FCVehicleFancy is a one or two page vehicle that looks nicer but takes up more
space.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Vehicle page.  Always on a new page. Image optional.
    /// If the Img is provided, it will take up two facing pages, otherwise only one, but a full page, unlike the Simple.
    ///
    /// - Vehicle (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the Vehicle stats.
    /// - Img (image | none): Image to go at the top of the first page. Set to none to remove.
    /// - TextVOffset (length): How far to push the text down the page. Want to do that inset text thing the book does? You can, the text can overlap with thte image.  Does nothing if no Img provided.
    /// - BoxText (dictionary): Pairs of values to go in the box over the image. Does nothing if no Img provided.
    /// - BoxAnchor (str): Which anchor of the image to put the box in?  Sample values are "north", "south-west", "center".
    /// - FirstPageContent (content): Goes on the first page. If no image is provided, it is not present.
    /// - AfterContent (content): Goes after the stat block. Always present.
    /// -> content

    // Example
    #FCVehicleFancy(
      read("Sample Vehicle_stats.json"),
      Img: image("images/Wandelburg.png"),
      TextVOffset: 6.2in,
      BoxText: ("Role": "Fast Bomber", "First Flight": "1601", "Strengths": "Fastest Bomber"),
      BoxAnchor: "north-east",
    )[
    #lorem(100)
    ][
    #lorem(100)
    ]


Last of the vehicles, FCShip is for boats like Into the Drink.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Ship page.  Always on a new page. Image optional.
    ///
    /// - Ship (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the Ship stats.
    /// - Img (image | none): Image to go at the top of the page. Set to none to remove.
    /// - DescriptiveText (content): Goes below the name and above the stats table.
    /// - notes (content): Goes in the notes section.
    /// -> content

    // Example: No builder for Ships, so you'll have to put it in your own JSON, or just a dict, like this.
    #let ship_stats = (
      Name: "Macchi Frigate",
      Speed: 5,
      Handling: 15,
      Hardness: 9,
      Soak: 0,
      Strengths: "-",

        (Name: "x6 Pom-Pom Gun", Fore: "x2", Left: "x3", Right: "x3", Rear: "x2", Up: "x6"),
        (Name: "x2 WMG", Left: "x1", Right: "x1"),
      ),
      DamageStates: ("", "-1 Speed", "-3 Guns", "-1 Speed", "-3 Guns", "Sinking"),
    )

    #FCShip(
      Img: image("images/Macchi Frigate.png"),
      Ship: ship_stats,
    )[
      #lorem(100)
    ][
      #lorem(5)
    ]


Additional functions include FCWeapon



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Weapon card. Image optional.

===  With ` raw `

You can also use [ ` raw ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/raw/) for
the conversion. This is useful if the notation uses a lot of backslashes.



    #import "@preview/ascii-ipa:2.0.0": praat

    // regular string
    #praat("\\'1\\cf\\hs\\cf\\:f\\'2\\ae\\sh\\:ftl\\ic")

    // raw
    #praat(`\'1\cf\hs\cf\:f\'2\ae\sh\:ftl\ic`)


Note: ` raw ` will not play nicely with notations that use ` ` ` a lot.

==  Brackets & Braces

You can easily mark your notation text as different types of brackets or
braces.

= *gridlock.md*

=  gridlock

0.2.0

Grid typesetting in Typst

Grid typesetting in Typst. Use this package if you want to line up your body
text across columns and pages.

==  Example

![An example image showing a two-column page with headings, a block quote, a
footnote, a figure, a display formula, and a bulleted list. All body text in
both columns lines
up.](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/gridlock/0.2.0/docs/assets/example-
lines.png)

==  Getting Started



    #import "@preview/gridlock:0.2.0": *

    #show: gridlock.with()

    #lock[= This is a heading]

    #lorem(30)

    #figure(
      placement: auto,
      caption: [a caption],
      rect()
    )

    #lorem(30)


==  Usage

Check out [ the manual
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/gridlock/0.2.0/docs/gridlock-
manual.pdf) for a detailed description.

To get started, import the package into your document:



    #import "@preview/gridlock:0.2.0": *


Set up the basic parameters:



    #show: gridlock.with(
      paper: "a4",
      margin: (y: 76.445pt),
      font-size: 11pt,
      line-height: 13pt
    )


You can now use the ` lock() ` function to align any block to the text grid.
Block quotes bulleted/numbered lists, and floating figures do _not_ need to be
wrapped in ` lock() ` . Their spacing is handled fully automatically.



    #lock[= Heading]

    #lorem(50)

    #lock(figure(
      rect(),
      caption: [An example figure aligned to the grid.]
    ))

    #lorem(50)

    #lock[$ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 $]

    #lorem(50)


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` gridlock `



    #import "@preview/gridlock:0.2.0"

= *natrix.md*

=  natrix

0.1.0

Natural and consistent matrix for typst.

![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/natrix/0.1.0/natrix.svg)

` natrix.nat ` is a drop-in replacement for ` mat ` with some additional
features. ` nat ` ensures that each row in your matrix should have the similar
height, unless one of them becomes too tall.

At this moment, it is recommended to use ` nat ` only in display equations,
but not in inline equations. This is because ` nat ` looks a little bit off
when used in inline equations.

==  Documentation

===  ` nat `

Every thing is the same as ` mat ` in typst.

This package also provides ` bnat ` , ` Bnat ` , ` vnat ` , ` Vnat ` ,

===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` natrix `

template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/bamdone-
aiaa-0.1.1-small.webp)

=  bamdone-aiaa

0.1.1

An American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) template for
conferences.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=bamdone-aiaa&version=0.1.1)

This is a Typst template for a one-column paper from the proceedings of the
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. The paper is tightly
spaced, fits a lot of content and comes preconfigured for numeric citations
from BibLaTeX or Hayagriva files.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` bamdone-aiaa ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/bamdone-aiaa


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` aiaa ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` authors-and-affiliations ` : An array of author dictionaries and affiliation dictionaries. Author dictionaries must have a ` name ` key and can have the keys ` job ` , ` department ` , ` aiaa ` is optional. Affiliation dictionaries must have the keys ` institution ` , ` city ` , ` state ` , ` zip ` , and ` country ` .
  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or ` none ` . Appears at the top of the first column in boldface. Shall be ` content ` .
  - ` paper-size ` : Defaults to ` us-letter ` . Specify a [ paper size string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-paper) to change the page format.
  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the ` bibliography ` function or ` none ` . Specifying this will configure numeric, AIAA-style citations.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
paper.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` aiaa `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/bamdone-aiaa:0.1.0": aiaa

    #show: aiaa.with(
      title: [A typesetting system to untangle the scientific writing process],

        These instructions give you guidelines for preparing papers for AIAA Technical Papers. Use this document as a template if you are using Typst. Otherwise, use this document as an instruction set. Define all symbols used in the abstract. Do not cite references in the abstract. The footnote on the first page should list the Job Title and AIAA Member Grade for each author, if known. Authors do not have to be AIAA members.

0.1.0

Parse, normalize and show publication frontmatter, including authors and
affiliations

_Beautiful scientific documents with structured metadata for publishers_

[ ![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/typst-docs-orange.svg)
](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/docs.pdf) [
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/LICENSE)

Pubmatter is a typst library for parsing, normalizing and showing scientific
publication frontmatter.

Utilities for loading, normalizing and working with authors, affiliations,
abstracts, keywords and other frontmatter information common in scientific
publications. Our goal is to introduce standardized ways of working with this
content to expose metadata to scientific publishers who are interested in
using typst in a standardized way. The specification for this ` pubmatter ` is
based on [ MyST Markdown ](https://mystmd.org/) and [ Quarto
](https://quarto.org/) , and can load their YAML files directly.

==  Examples

Pubmatter was used to create these documents, for loading the authors in a
standardized way and creting the common elements (authors, affiliations,
ORCIDs, DOIs, Open Access Links, copyright statements, etc.)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curvenote/pubmatter/main/images/scipy.png?raw=true)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curvenote/pubmatter/main/images/agrogeo.png?raw=true)

==  Documentation

The full documentation can be found in [ docs.pdf
](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/docs.pdf) . To use `
pubmatter ` import it:



    #import "@preview/pubmatter:0.1.0"


The docs also use ` pubmatter ` , in a simplified way, you can see the [
docs.typ ](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/docs.typ) to see a
simple example of using various components to create a new document. Here is a
preview of the docs:

[
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curvenote/pubmatter/main/images/pubmatter.png?raw=true)
](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/docs.pdf)

===  Loading Frontmatter

The frontmatter can contain all information for an article, including title,
authors, affiliations, abstracts and keywords. These are then normalized into
a standardized format that can be used with a number of ` show ` functions
like ` show-authors ` . For example, we might have a YAML file that looks like
this:



    author: Rowan Cockett
    date: 2024/01/26


You can load that file with ` yaml ` , and pass it to the ` load ` function:



    #let fm = pubmatter.load(yaml("pubmatter.yml"))


This will give you a normalized data-structure that can be used with the `
show ` functions for showing various parts of a document.

You can also use a ` dictionary ` directly:



    #let fm = pubmatter.load((
      author: (
        (
          name: "Rowan Cockett",
          email: "rowan@curvenote.com",
          orcid: "0000-0002-7859-8394",
          affiliations: "Curvenote Inc.",
        ),
      ),
      date: datetime(year: 2024, month: 01, day: 26),
      doi: "10.1190/tle35080703.1",
    ))
    #pubmatter.show-author-block(fm)


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curvenote/pubmatter/main/images/author-
block.png?raw=true)

===  Theming

The theme including color and font choice can be set using the ` THEME `
state. For example, this document has the following theme set:



    #let theme = (color: red.darken(20%), font: "Noto Sans")
    #set page(header: pubmatter.show-page-header(theme: theme, fm), footer: pubmatter.show-page-footer(fm))
    #state("THEME").update(theme)


Note that for the ` header ` the theme must be passed in directly. This will
hopefully become easier in the future, however, there is a current bug that
removes the page header/footer if you set this above the ` set page ` . See [
https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2987
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pubmatter/0.1.0/#2987)
.

The ` font ` option only corresponds to the frontmatter content (abstracts,
title, header/footer etc.) allowing the body of your document to have a
different font choice.

===  Normalized Frontmatter Object

The frontmatter object has the following normalized structure:



    title: content
    subtitle: content
    short-title: string # alias: running-title, running-head
    # Authors Array
    # simple string provided for author is turned into ((name: string),)
    authors: # alias: author
      - name: string
        url: string # alias: website, homepage
        email: string
        phone: string
        fax: string
        orcid: string # alias: ORCID
        note: string
        corresponding: boolean # default: `true` when email set
        equal-contributor: boolean # alias: equalContributor, equal_contributor
        deceased: boolean
        roles: string[] # must be a contributor role
        affiliations: # alias: affiliation
          - id: string
            index: number
    # Affiliations Array
    affiliations: # alias: affiliation
      - string # simple string is turned into (name: string)
      - id: string
        index: number
        name: string
        institution: string # use either name or institution
    # Other publication metadata
    open-access: boolean
    license: # Can be set with a SPDX ID for creative commons
      id: string
      url: string
      name: string
    doi: string # must be only the ID, not the full URL
    date: datetime # validates from 'YYYY-MM-DD' if a string
    citation: content
    # Abstracts Array
    # content is turned into ((title: "Abstract", content: string),)
    abstracts: # alias: abstract
      - title: content
        content: content


Note that you will usually write the affiliations directly in line, in the
following example, we can see that the output is a normalized affiliation
object that is linked by the ` id ` of the affiliation (just the name if it is
a string!).



    #let fm = pubmatter.load((
      authors: (
        (
          name: "Rowan Cockett",
          affiliations: "Curvenote Inc.",
        ),
        (
          name: "Steve Purves",
          affiliations: ("Executable Books", "Curvenote Inc."),
        ),
      ),
    ))
    #raw(lang:"yaml", yaml.encode(fm))

0.1.0

Help the Typst Guys reach the helicopter pad and save Christmas!

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=icicle&version=0.1.0)

Help the Typst Guys reach the helicopter pad and save Christmas! Navigate them
with the WASD keys and solve puzzles with snowballs to make way for the Typst
Guys.

This small Christmas-themed game is playable in the Typst editor and best
enjoyed with the web app or ` typst watch ` . It was first released for the 24
Days to Christmas campaign in winter of 2023.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` icicle ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/icicle


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` game ` function, which accepts a positional
argument for the game input.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` game `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/icicle:0.1.0": game
    #show: game

    // Move with WASD.


You can also add your own levels by adding an array of level definition
strings in the ` game ` functionâs named ` levels ` argument. Each level
file must conform to the following format:

  - First, a line with two comma separated integers indicating the playerâs starting position.
  - Then, a matrix with the characters f (floor), x (wall), w (water), or g (goal).
  - Finally, a matrix with the characters b (snowball) or _ (nothing).

The three arguments must be separated by double newlines. Additionally, each
row in the matrices space-separates its values. Newlines terminate the rows.
Comments can be added with a double slash. Find an example for a valid level
string below:



    // The starting position
    0, 0

    // The back layer
    f f f w f f f
    f f f w f f f
    f f x w f f f
    f f f w f f f
    f f f w f x x
    x x x g x x x

    // The front layer.
    _ _ b _ _ _ _
    _ _ b _ _ _ _
    _ _ _ _ b _ _
    _ _ _ _ b _ _
    _ _ _ _ _ _ _
    _ _ _ _ _ _ _


Itâs best to put levels into separate files and load them with the ` read `
function.

= *unify.md*

=  unify

0.7.0

Format numbers, units, and ranges correctly.

Featured  Package

` unify ` is a [ Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) package simplifying
the typesetting of numbers, units, and ranges. It is the equivalent to
LaTeXâs ` siunitx ` , though not as mature.

==  Overview

` unify ` allows flexible numbers and units, and still mostly gets well
typeset results.



    #import "@preview/unify:0.7.0": num,qty,numrange,qtyrange

    $ num("-1.32865+-0.50273e-6") $
    $ qty("1.3+1.2-0.3e3", "erg/cm^2/s", space: "#h(2mm)") $
    $ numrange("1,1238e-2", "3,0868e5", thousandsep: "'") $
    $ qtyrange("1e3", "2e3", "meter per second squared", per: "/", delimiter: "\"to\"") $


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/unify/0.7.0/examples/overview.jpg)

Right now, physical, monetary, and binary units are supported. New issues or
pull requests for new units are welcome!

==  Multilingual support

The Unify package supports multiple languages. Currently, the supported
languages are English and Russian. The fallback is English. If you want to add
your language, you should add two files: ` prefixes-xx.csv ` and ` units-
xx.csv ` , and in the ` lib.typ ` file you should fix the ` lang-db ` state
for your files.

==  ` num `

` num ` uses string parsing in order to typeset numbers, including separators
between the thousands. They can have the following form:

  - ` float ` or ` integer ` number
  - either ( ` {} ` stands for a number)
    - symmetric uncertainties with ` +-{} `
    - asymmetric uncertainties with ` +{}-{} `
  - exponential notation ` e{} `

Parentheses are automatically set as necessary. Use ` thousandsep ` to change
the separator between the thousands, and ` multiplier ` to change the
multiplication symbol between the number and exponential.

==  ` unit `

` unit ` takes the unit in words or in symbolic notation as its first
argument. The value of ` space ` will be inserted between units if necessary.
Setting ` per ` to ` symbol ` will format the number with exponents (i.e. `
^(-1) ` ), ` fraction ` or ` / ` using fraction, and ` fraction-short ` or `
\\/ ` using in-line fractions.
Units in words have four possible parts:

  - ` per ` forms the inverse of the following unit.
  - A written-out prefix in the sense of SI (e.g. ` centi ` ). This is added before the unit.
  - The unit itself written out (e.g. ` gram ` ).
  - A postfix like ` squared ` . This is added after the unit and takes ` per ` into account.

The shorthand notation also has four parts:

  - ` / ` forms the inverse of the following unit.
  - A short prefix in the sense of SI (e.g. ` k ` ). This is added before the unit.
  - The short unit itself (e.g. ` g ` ).
  - An exponent like ` ^2 ` . This is added after the unit and takes ` / ` into account.

Note: Use ` u ` for micro.

The possible values of the three latter parts are loaded at runtime from `
prefixes.csv ` , ` units.csv ` , and ` postfixes.csv ` (in the library
directory). Your own units etc. can be permanently added in these files. At
runtime, they can be added using ` add-unit ` and ` add-prefix ` ,
respectively. The formats for the pre- and postfixes are:

pre-/postfix  |  shorthand  |  symbol
---|---|---
milli  |  m  |  upright(âmâ)

and for units:

unit  |  shorthand  |  symbol  |  space
---|---|---|---
meter  |  m  |  upright(âmâ)  |  true

The first column specifies the written-out word, the second one the shorthand.
These should be unique. The third column represents the string that will be
inserted as the unit symbol. For units, the last column describes whether
there should be space before the unit (possible values: ` true ` / ` false ` ,
` 1 ` , ` 0 ` ). This is mostly the cases for degrees and other angle units
(e.g. arcseconds).
If you think there are units not included that are of interest for other
users, you can create an issue or PR.

==  ` qty `

` qty ` allows a ` num ` as the first argument following the same rules. The
second argument is a unit. If ` rawunit ` is set to true, its value will be
passed on to the result (note that the string passed on will be passed to `
eval ` , so add escaped quotes ` \" ` if necessary). Otherwise, it follows the
rules of ` unit ` . The value of ` space ` will be inserted between units if
necessary, ` thousandsep ` between the thousands, and ` per ` switches between
exponents and fractions.

==  ` numrange `

` numrange ` takes two ` num ` s as the first two arguments. If they have the
same exponent, it is automatically factorized. The range symbol can be changed
with ` delimiter ` , and the space between the numbers and symbols with `
space ` .

==  ` qtyrange `

` qtyrange ` is just a combination of ` unit ` and ` range ` .

=  wenyuan-campaign

0.1.0

Easily write DnD 5e style campaign documents.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=wenyuan-campaign&version=0.1.0)

A template for writing RPG campaigns imitating the 5e theme. This was made as
a typst version of the $\LaTeX$ package [ DnD 5e LaTeX Template
](https://github.com/rpgtex/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template) , though it is not
functionally nor entirely visually similar.

Packages:

  - ` droplet:0.3.1 `

Fonts:

  - TeX Gyre Bonum
  - Scaly Sans
  - Scaly Sans Caps
  - Royal Initalen
  - äº¬è¯èå®ä½ KingHwa OldSong

_*Please note: in an effort to reduce the file size of the template, fonts
are included in MY repository only, not in the typst official one.* _ You may
find the fonts in my [ github repository in the fonts folder
](https://github.com/yanwenywan/typst-packages/tree/master/wenyuan-
campaign/0.1.0/template/fonts) , or download them yourself, or heck provide
your own fonts to your liking.



    typst init @preview/wenyuan-campaign:0.1.0


This will copy over all required fonts and comes prefilled with the standard
template so you can see how it works. To use this you need to either install
all the fonts locally or pass the folder into --font-path when compiling.

To initialise the style, do:



    #import "@preview/wenyuan-campaign:0.1.0": *

    #show: conf.with()


Very easy.

Optionally, you may set all the theme fonts from the configure function (the
defaults are shown):



    #import "@preview/wenyuan-campaign:0.1.0": *

    #show: conf.with(
        fontsize: 10pt,
        mainFont: ("TeX Gyre Bonum", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        titleFont: ("TeX Gyre Bonum", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        sansFont: ("Scaly Sans Remake", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        sansSmallcapsFont: ("Scaly Sans Caps", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        dropcapFont: "Royal Initialen"
    )

This shouldnât affect homebrew created using these fonts (just like how a painting made with a CC-BY-SA art program isnât itself CC-BY-SA) but what do I know Iâm not a lawyer.* _
  - [ KingHwa_OldSong ](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/637491623) (äº¬è¯èå®ä½) is a traditional Chinese print font used for all CJK text (if present, mostly because I need it)

0.1.0

Wrap content in custom functions with just indentation

` wrap-indent ` is a package for wrapping content in custom functions with
just indentation. This lets you avoid using trailing square brackets to wrap
content, instead you just indent it!

This system works by re-purposing Typstâs existing [ term-list
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/terms/) syntax via a custom show rule
on ` terms.item ` . We give it our custom function within [ state
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/introspection/state/) via a new ` wrap-in()
` function.

==  Hereâs a minimal example!

![A minimal
example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/wrap-
indent/0.1.0/example_page1.png)



    #set page(height: auto, width: 3.5in, margin: 0.25in)

    #import "@preview/wrap-indent:0.1.0": wrap-in, allow-wrapping

    #show terms.item: allow-wrapping

    / First --:
      A normal term list

      with multiple paragraphs

    But this text is separated


    #line(length: 100%)


    #let custom-block(content) = rect(content,
      fill: orange.lighten(90%),
      stroke: 1.5pt + gradient.linear(..color.map.flare)
    )

    / #wrap-in(custom-block):
      A *custom block* using the `wrap-in` function

      with indented text \
      over multiple lines

    And this text is _still_ separated!


And in its own code block, hereâs the required initialization:



    #import "@preview/wrap-indent:0.1.0": wrap-in, allow-wrapping

    #show terms.item: allow-wrapping


==  And hereâs a more complicated example!

![A more complicated
example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/wrap-
indent/0.1.0/example_page2.png)



    #set page(height: auto, width: 4.1in, margin: 0.25in)

    #show heading: set text(size: 0.75em)
    #show heading: set block(below: 1em)
    #set heading(numbering: "1) ")

    = Normal function call:

    // A function for wrapping some text:
    #let custom-quote(body) = rect(
      body,
      width: 100%,
      fill: luma(95%),
      stroke: (left: 2pt + luma(30%))
    )

    #custom-quote[
      Some text in a _custom quote_ spread over multiple lines
      so it actually looks like it was typed in a document.
    ]
    This text is outside the quote box


    = Wrappped function call!

    / #wrap-in(custom-quote):
      Some text in a _custom quote_ spread over multiple lines
      so it actually looks like it was typed in a document.

    This text is _still_ outside the quote box!


    = Arbitrary functions should _just work#emoji.tm;_

    / #wrap-in(x => ellipse(align(center, x),
        stroke: 3pt + gradient.conic(..color.map.rainbow)
      )):
      Some text in a _rainbow ellipse_ spread
      over multiple lines so it actually looks
      like it was typed in a document.


    = One-liners look great!

    / #wrap-in(underline): Here's one line underlined


    = Let's do some math:

    #let named-thm(name) = (content) => {
      pad(left: 2em, par(hanging-indent: -2em)[
        *Theorem* (#name) #emph(content)
      ])
    }

    / #wrap-in(named-thm("Operational Soundness")):
      If $med tack e : tau$ and $e$ reduces to $e'$
      by zero or more steps and $"Irred"(e')$,
      then $e' in "Val"$ and $med tack e' : tau$.


    = In-line styling doesn't create blocks:

    / #wrap-in(highlight):
      This text is highlighted.
    This text isn't.

    Notice how there was *no* paragraph break between the
    two sentences? This is a useful result that makes
    `wrap-indent` really flexible!

    (if you want separate blocks, use `block` in your function)


    = Does it work with nesting?

    / #wrap-in(custom-quote):
      Testing...
      / #wrap-in(align.with(center)):
        / #wrap-in(rect):
          / #wrap-in(emph):
            Signs point to yes!


    = Final thoughts

    / Note --:
      Regular term lists still work!

    / Disclaimer --:
      You may run into issues with other term list
      show rules conflicting with this rule. \
      (although set rules should be unaffected)

      If you run into issues, _let me know!_ I'd love to hear
      about it to make this package as robust as possible.


    = And

    #let big-statement(content) = {
      align(center, text(
        underline(stroke: 1.5pt, content),
        size: 32pt,
        weight: "bold",
        style: "italic",
        fill: eastern,
      ))
    }

    / #wrap-in(big-statement):
      That's a wrap!

0.2.0

A helper library for chaining lambda abstractions

A helper library for chaining lambda abstractions, imitating the ` |> ` or ` .
` operator in some functional languages.

The function ` compose ` is the ` pipe ` function in the mathematical order.
Functions suffixed with underscore have their arguments flipped.

==  Changelog

  - 0.2.0 Redesigned interface to work with typstâs ` with ` keyword.
  - 0.1.0 Initial release

==  Basic usage

It can help improve readability with nested applications to a content value,
or make the diff cleaner.



    #compose_((
      text.with(blue),
      emph,
      strong,
      underline,
      strike,
    ))[This is a very long content with a lot of words]
    // Is equivalent to
    #text(
      blue,
      emph(
        strong(
          underline(
            strike[This is a very long content with a lot of words]
          )
        )
      )
    )


You can use it for show rules just like the example above.



    #show link: compose_.with((
      text.with(fill: blue),
      emph,
      underline,
    ))
    // These two are equivalent
    #show link: text.with(fill: blue)
    #show link: emph
    #show link: underline


This can also be useful when you need to destructure lists, as it allows
creating binds that are scoped by each lambda expression.



    #let two_and_one = pipe(
      (1, 2),
      (
        ((a, b)) => (a, b, -1), // becomes a list of length three
        ((a, b, _)) => (b, a), // discard the third element and swap
      ),
    )

0.1.1

Anatomy of a Font. Visualise metrics.

_Anatomy of a Font_ . Visualise metrics.

Import the ` anatomy ` package:



    #import "@preview/anatomy:0.1.1": metrics


==  Display Metrics

` metrics(72pt, "EB Garamond", display: "Typewriter") ` will be rendered as
follows:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E8D08F/packages/main/packages/preview/anatomy/0.1.1/img/export-1.svg)

Additionally, a closure using ` metrics ` dictionary as parameter can be used
to layout additional elements below:



    #metrics(54pt, "ä¸é»æé«",
      display: "é»å³æå­æ©",
      use: metrics => table(
        columns: 2,
        ..metrics.pairs().flatten().map(x => [ #x ])
      )
    )


It will generate:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E8D08F/packages/main/packages/preview/anatomy/0.1.1/img/export-2.svg)

==  Remark on Hybrid Typesetting

To typeset CJK text, adopting fontâs ascender/descender as ` top-edge ` / `
bottom-edge ` makes more sense in some cases. As for most CJK fonts, the
difference between ascender and descender heights will be exact 1em.

Tested with ` metrics(54pt, "Hiragino Mincho ProN", "ãã¬ã¿ã¤ãç«¯æ«") `
:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E8D08F/packages/main/packages/preview/anatomy/0.1.1/img/export-3.svg)

Since Typst will use metrics of the font which has the largest advance height
amongst the list provided in ` set text(font: ( ... )) ` to set up top and
bottom edges of a line, leading might not work as expected in hybrid
typesetting. This issue can be solved by passing the document to `
metrics(use: metrics => { ... }) ` like this:



    #show: doc => metrics(font.size, font.main,
      // Retrieve the metrics of the CJK font
      use: metrics => {
        set text(
          font.size,
          font: ( font.latin, font.main ),
          features: ( "pkna", ),
          // Use CJK fontâs ascender/descender as top/bottom edges
          top-edge: metrics.ascender,
          bottom-edge: metrics.descender,
          // ...
        )

        doc
      }
    )

= *idwtet.md*

=  idwtet

0.3.0

Package for uniform, correct and simplified typst code demonstration.

The name ` idwtet ` stands for âI Donât Wanna Type Everything Twiceâ. It
provides a ` typst-ex ` and a ` typst-ex-code ` codeblock, which _shows*and*
executes _ typst code.

It is meant for code demonstration, e.g. when publishing a package, and
provides some niceties:

  - the code should always be correct in the examples: As the example code is used for the code block, but also for evaluation, there is no need to write it twice
  - easy configuration with simple, uniform and good look

However, there are some limitations:

  - Every code block has its own local scope and the default behaviour is that variables are not reachable from outside. A similar restriction lies on import statements. That is why, there is the ` eval-scope ` argument, which captures variables and simulates global variables. Additionally, a ` typst ` codeblock is provided for a consistent look.
  - Locality can be displayed to the users by automatically wrapping code in ` typst-ex-code ` , but ` typst-ex ` does not provide such functionality. It might thus be difficult for users to understand code examples this way.
  - The page width has to be defined in absolute terms. It is quite nice, for a showcase, to take the least possible space, but tracking the widths of all boxes and then setting the page width accordingly is not (yet) possible.

==  Usage

Only one function is defined, ` init(body, bcolor: luma(210), inset: 5pt,
border: 2pt, radius: 2pt, content-font: "linux libertine", code-font-size:
9pt, content-font-size: 11pt, code-return-box: true, wrap-code: false, eval-
scope: (:), escape-bracket: "%") ` , which is supposed to be used with a show
rule.

Then raw codeblocks (with ` block=true ` ) of the languages ` typst ` , `
typst-ex ` , ` typst-code ` and ` typst-ex-code ` are modified. The main
feature of this package are ` typst-ex ` and ` typst-ex-code ` . The ` typst `
and ` typst-code ` blocks do not evaluate anything, but their design fits that
of the others.

The parameters of ` init ` are:

  - ` body ` : for usage with show rule, hence the whole document.
  - ` bcolor ` : the background- (and border-) color of the blocks
  - ` inset ` : inset param of code and content blocks, should be â¥ 2pt
  - ` border ` : border thickness
  - ` radius ` : block radius
  - ` content-font ` : The font used in the previewed content / result.
  - ` code-font-size ` : The fontsize used in the code blocks.
  - ` content-font-size ` : The fontsize used in the preview content / result.
  - ` code-return-box ` : If to show the code return type on ` typst-ex-code ` blocks.
  - ` wrap-code ` : If to wrap the code in ` #{ ` and ` } ` , to symbolize local scope.
  - ` eval-scope ` : A dictionary with the keys as the variable names and the values as another dictionary with keys ` value ` and ` code ` , both of these are optional. The former has the defined value, the latter the code recreate the variable, for usage in the code blocks.
  - ` escape-bracket ` : The text to wrap a variable with, to access the ` code ` part of a ` eval-scope ` variable.

==  Hiding code and replacements

There are currently two methods to change the code:

  - use the ` eval-scope ` argument from the ` init ` function. There is a ` code ` field in the dictionaries, which enables the usage of the key escaped in ` escape-bracket ` to be replaced in the codeblock code half and to be removed in the codeblock result half, as the value is given via scope. Take a look at the example below, where ` %ouset% ` is used this way.
  - use the ` ENDHIDDEN ` feature. When escaped in ` escape-bracket ` , everything above the statement is removed from the codeblock code half BUT everything (without the ` ENDHIDDEN ` statement) is evaluated. Take a look at the example in the examples folder.

==  Example



    #set page(margin: 0.5cm, width: 14cm, height: auto)
    #import "@preview/idwtet:0.1.0"
    #show: idwtet.init.with(eval-scope: (
      ouset: (
        value: {import "@preview/ouset:0.1.1": ouset; ouset},
        code: "#import \"@preview/ouset:0.1.1\": ouset"
      )
    ))

    == ouset package #text(gray)[(v0.1.1)]
    ```typst-ex
    %ouset%
    $
    "Expression 1" ouset(&, <==>, "Theorem 1") "Expression 2"\
                   ouset(&, ==>,, "Theorem 7") "Expression 3"
    $
    ```
    Or something like
    ```typst-ex-code
    let a = range(10)
    a
    ```


Further examples are given in the repo example folder.

= *down.md*

=  down

0.1.0

Pass down arguments of `sum`, `integral`, etc. to the next line, which can
generate shorthand to present reusable segments.

Pass down arguments of ` sum ` , ` integral ` , etc. to the next line, which
can generate shorthand to present reusable segments. While writing long step-
by-step equations, only certain parts of a line change. ` down ` leverages
Typstâs ` context ` (from version 0.11.0) to help relieve the pressure of
writing long and repetitive formulae.

Import the package:



    #import "@preview/down:0.1.0": *


==  Usage

Create new contexts by using camel-case commands, such as ` Limit(x, +0) ` .
Retrieve the contextual with ` cLimit ` .

  - ` Limit(x, c) ` and ` cLimit ` :



    $
    Lim(x, +0) x ln(sin x)
      = cLim ln(sin x) / x^(-1)
      = cLim x / (sin x) cos x
      = 0
    $

*Quill* is a package for creating quantum circuit diagrams in [ Typst
](https://typst.app/) .

_Note, that this package is in beta and may still be undergoing breaking
changes. As new features like data types and scoped functions will be added to
Typst, this package will be adapted to profit from the new paradigms._

_Meanwhile, we suggest importing everything from the package in a local scope
to avoid polluting the global namespace (see example below)._

  - [ *Cheat sheet* ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/quill/0.5.0/#cheat-sheet) _gallery for quickly viewing all kinds of gates_

  - [ *Changelog* ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/quill/0.5.0/#changelog)

==  Basic usage

The function ` quantum-circuit() ` takes any number of positional gates and
works somewhat similarly to the built-int Typst functions ` table() ` or `
grid() ` . A variety of different gate and instruction commands are available
for adding elements and integers can be used to produce any number of empty
cells (filled with the current wire style). A new wire is started by adding a
` [\ ] ` item.



    #{
      import "@preview/quill:0.5.0": *

      quantum-circuit(
        lstick($|0âª$), $H$, ctrl(1), rstick($(|00âª+|11âª)/â2$, n: 2), [\ ],
        lstick($|0âª$), 1, targ(), 1
      )
    }


![Bell circuit](https://github.com/user-
attachments/assets/53d0c581-ab62-44e3-abf5-5497993d7aba)

Plain quantum gates â such as a Hadamard gate â can be written with the
shorthand notation ` $H$ ` instead of the more lengthy ` gate($H$) ` . The
latter offers more options, however.

Refer to the [ user guide ](https://github.com/Mc-
Zen/quill/releases/download/v0.5.0/quill-guide.pdf) for a full documentation
of this package. You can also look up the documentation of any function by
calling the help module, e.g., ` help("gate") ` in order to print the
signature and description of the ` gate ` command, just where you are
currently typing (powered by [ tidy ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/tidy) ).

==  Cheat Sheet

Instead of listing every featured gate (as is done in the [ user guide
](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/quill/releases/download/v0.5.0/quill-guide.pdf) ),
this gallery quickly showcases a large selection of possible gates and
decorations that can be added to any quantum circuit.

==  Tequila

_Tequila_ is a submodule that adds a completely different way of building
circuits.



    #import "@preview/quill:0.5.0" as quill: tequila as tq

    #quill.quantum-circuit(
      ..tq.build(
        tq.h(0),
        tq.cx(0, 1),
        tq.cx(0, 2),
      ),
      quill.gategroup(x: 2, y: 0, 3, 2)
    )


This is similar to how _QASM_ and _Qiskit_ work: gates are successively
applied to the circuit which is then layed out automatically by packing gates
as tightly as possible. We start by calling the ` tq.build() ` function and
filling it with quantum operations. This returns a collection of gates which
we expand into the circuit with the ` .. ` syntax. Now, we still have the
option to add annotations, groups, slices, or even more gates via manual
placement.

The syntax works analog to Qiskit. Available gates are ` x ` , ` y ` , ` z ` ,
` h ` , ` s ` , ` sdg ` , ` sx ` , ` sxdg ` , ` t ` , ` tdg ` , ` p ` , ` rx `
, ` ry ` , ` rz ` , ` u ` , ` cx ` , ` cz ` , and ` swap ` . With ` barrier `
, an invisible barrier can be inserted to prevent gates on different qubits to
be packed tightly. Finally, with ` tq.gate ` and ` tq.mqgate ` , a generic
gate can be created. These two accept the same styling arguments as the normal
` gate ` (or ` mqgate ` ).

Also like Qiskit, all qubit arguments support ranges, e.g., ` tq.h(range(5)) `
adds a Hadamard gate on the first five qubits and ` tq.cx((0, 1), (1, 2)) `
adds two CX gates: one from qubit 0 to 1 and one from qubit 1 to 2.

With Tequila, it is easy to build templates for quantum circuits and to
compose circuits of various building blocks. For this purpose, ` tq.build() `
and the built-in templates all feature optional ` x ` and ` y ` arguments to
allow placing a subcircuit at an arbitrary position of the circuit. As an
example, Tequila provides a ` tq.graph-state() ` template for quickly drawing
graph state preparation circuits.

The following example demonstrates how to compose multiple subcircuits.



    #import tequila as tq

    #quantum-circuit(
      ..tq.graph-state((0, 1), (1, 2)),
      ..tq.build(y: 3,
          tq.p($pi$, 0),
          tq.cx(0, (1, 2)),
        ),
      ..tq.graph-state(x: 6, y: 2, invert: true, (0, 1), (0, 2)),
      gategroup(x: 1, 3, 3),
      gategroup(x: 1, y: 3, 3, 3),
      gategroup(x: 6, y: 2, 3, 3),
      slice(x: 5)
    )

==  Tests

This package uses [ typst-test ](https://github.com/tingerrr/typst-test/) for
running [ tests ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/quill/tree/v0.5.0/tests/) .

==  Changelog

===  v0.5.0

  - Added support for multi-controlled gates with Tequila.
  - Switched to using ` context ` instead of the now deprecated ` style() ` for measurement. Note: Starting with this version, Typst 0.11.0 or higher is required.

===  v0.4.0

  - Alternative model for creating and composing circuits: [ Tequila ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/quill/0.5.0/#tequila) .

===  v0.3.0

  - New features
    - Enable manual placement of gates, ` gate($X$, x: 3, y: 1) ` , similar to built-in ` table() ` in addition to automatic placement. This works for most elements, not only gates.
    - Add parameter ` pad ` to ` lstick() ` and ` rstick() ` .
    - Add parameter ` fill-wires ` to ` quantum-circuit() ` . All wires are filled unto the end (determined by the longest wire) by default (breaking change â ï¸). This behavior can be reverted by setting ` fill-wires: false ` .
    - ` gategroup() ` ` slice() ` and ` annotate() ` can now be placed above or below the circuit with ` z: "above" ` and ` z: "below" ` .
    - ` help() ` command for quickly displaying the documentation of a given function, e.g., ` help("gate") ` . Powered by [ tidy ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/tidy) .
  - Improvements:
    - Complete rework of circuit layout implementation
      - allows transparent gates since wires are not drawn through gates anymore. The default fill is now ` auto ` and using ` none ` sets the background to transparent.
      - ` midstick ` is now transparent by default.
    - ` setwire() ` can now be used to override only partial wire settings, such as wire color ` setwire(1, stroke: blue) ` , width ` setwire(1, stroke: 1pt) ` or wire distance, all separately. Before, some settings were reset.
  - Fixes:
    - Fixed ` lstick ` / ` rstick ` when equation numbering is turned on.
  - Removed:
    - The already deprecated ` scale-factor ` (use ` scale ` instead)

===  v0.2.1

  - Improvements:
    - Add ` fill ` parameter to ` midstick() ` .
    - Add ` bend ` parameter to ` permute() ` .
    - Add ` separation ` parameter to ` permute() ` .
  - Fixes:
    - With Typst 0.11.0, ` scale() ` now takes into account outer alignment. This broke the positioning of centered/right-aligned circuits, e.g., ones put into a ` figure() ` .
    - Change wires to be drawn all through ` ctrl() ` , making it consistent to ` swap() ` and ` targ() ` .

===  v0.2.0

  - New features:
    - Add arbitrary labels to any ` gate ` (also derived gates such as ` meter ` , ` ctrl ` , â¦), ` gategroup ` or ` slice ` that can be anchored to any of the nine 2d alignments.
    - Add optional gate inputs and outputs for multi-qubit gates (see gallery).
    - Implicit gates (breaking change â ï¸): a content item automatically becomes a gate, so you can just type ` $H$ ` instead of ` gate($H$) ` (of course, the ` gate() ` function is still important in order to use the many available options).
  - Other breaking changes â ï¸:
    - ` slice() ` has no ` dx ` and ` dy ` parameters anymore. Instead, labels are handled through ` label ` exactly as in ` gate() ` . Also the ` wires ` parameter is replaced with ` n ` for consistency with other multi-qubit gates.
    - Swap order of row and column parameters in ` annotate() ` to make it consistent with built-in Typst functions.
  - Improvements:
    - Improve layout (allow row/column spacing and min lengths to be specified in em-lengths).
    - Automatic bounds computation, even for labels.
    - Improve meter (allow multi-qubit gate meters and respect global (per-circuit) gate padding).d
  - Fixes:
    - ` lstick ` / ` rstick ` braces broke with Typst 0.7.0.
    - ` lstick ` / ` rstick ` bounds.
  - Documentation
    - Add section on creating custom gates.
    - Add section on using labels.
    - Explain usage of ` slice() ` and ` gategroup() ` .

= *lasaveur.md*

=  lasaveur

0.1.3

Porting vim-latex's math shorthands to Typst. An accommendating vim syntax
file is provided in the repo.

This is a Typst package for speedy mathematical input, inspired by [ vim-latex
](https://github.com/vim-latex/vim-latex) . This project is named after my Vim
plugin [ vimtex-lasaveur ](https://github.com/yangwenbo99/vimtex-lasaveur) ,
which ports the operations in vim-latex to [ vimtex
](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) .

==  Usages in Typst

Either use the file released in âReleasesâ or import using the following
command:



    #import "@preview/lasaveur:0.1.3": *


This script generates a Typst library that defines shorthand commands for
various mathematical symbols and functions. Hereâs an overview of what it
provides and how a user can use it:

  1. Mathematical Functions:
     - Usage: ` f<key>(argument) `
     - Examples: ` fh(x) ` for hat, ` ft(x) ` for tilde, ` f2(x) ` for square root
  2. Font Styles:
     - Usage: ` f<key>(argument) `
     - Examples: ` fb(x) ` for bold, ` fbb(x) ` for blackboard bold, ` fca(x) ` for calligraphic
  3. Greek Letters:
     - Usage: ` k<key> `
     - Examples: ` ka ` for Î± (alpha), ` kb ` for Î² (beta), ` kG ` for Î (capital Gamma)
  4. Common Mathematical Symbols:
     - Usage: ` g<key> `
     - Examples: ` g8 ` for â (infinity), ` gU ` for âª (union), ` gI ` for â© (intersection)
  5. LaTeX-compatible Symbols:
     - Usage: Direct LaTeX command names
     - Examples: ` partial ` for â, ` infty ` for â, ` cdot ` for â
  6. Arrows:
     - Usage: ` ar.<key> `
     - Examples: ` ar.l ` for â, ` ar.r ` for â, ` ar.lr ` for â

Users can employ these shorthands in their Typst documents to quickly input
mathematical symbols and functions. The exact prefix for each category (like `
f ` for functions or ` k ` for Greek letters) can be customized using command-
line arguments when running the script.

For instance, in a Typst document, after importing the generated library, a
user could write:



    $fh(x) + ka + g8 + ar.r$


This would produce: xÌ + Î± + â + â

The script provides a wide range of symbols covering most common mathematical
notations, making it easier and faster to type complex mathematical
expressions in Typst â especially for users migrating from vim-latex.

==  Accompanying Vim Syntax File

The syntax file provides more advanced and correct concealing for both
Typstâs built-in math syntax and the lasaveur shorthands. Download the
syntax file from the âReleasesâ section and place it in your `
~/.vim/after/syntax/ ` directory. The ` syntax.vim ` file in the repo is
supposed to be used by the generation script and it _will not work_ if
directly sourced in Vim.

The label(s) of affiliation(s) must be those claimed in the argument ` affiliations ` . Once the email or address exists, the author(s) will be labelled as the corresponding author(s), and their address will show in footnotes. Function ` author-meta() ` is useful in creating information for each author. Default: ` ("Author Name": author-meta("affiliation-label")) ` .
  - ` affiliations ` : A dictionary of affiliation. Dictionary keys are affiliationsâ labels. These labels show be constent with those used in authorsâ meta data. Dictionary values are addresses of every affiliation. Default: ` ("affiliation-label": "Affiliation address") ` .
  - ` abstract ` : The paperâs abstract. Default: ` [] ` .
  - ` keywords ` : The paperâs keywords. Default: ` [] ` .
  - ` bib ` : The bibliography. Accept value from the built-in ` bibliography ` function. Default: ` none ` .
  - ` template ` : Templates for the following parts. Please see below for more informations
    - ` title: (title) => {} ` : how to show the title of this article.
    - ` author-info: (authors, affiliations) => {} ` : how to show each authorâs information.
    - ` abstract: (abstract, keywords) => {} ` : how to show the abstract and keywords.
    - ` bibliography: (bib) => {} ` : how to show the bibliography.
    - ` body: (body) => {} ` : how to show main text.

===  ` author-meta `

Arguments:

  - ` ..affiliation ` : Capture the positioned arguments as label(s) of affiliation(s). Mandatory.
  - ` email ` : The email address of the author. Default: ` none ` .
  - ` alias ` : The display name of the author. Default: ` none ` .
  - ` address ` : The address of the author. Default: ` none ` .
  - ` cofirst ` : Whether the author is the co-first author. Default: ` false ` .

0.1.4

Helpers to build manuals for Typst packages.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=mantys&version=0.1.4)

> *MAN* uals for *TY* p *S* t

Template for documenting [ typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) packages
and templates.

==  Usage

Just import the package at the beginning of your manual:



    #import "@preview/mantys:0.1.4": *


Mantys supports *Typst 0.11.0* and newer.

==  Writing basics

A basic template for a manual could look like this:



    #import "@local/mantys:0.1.4": *

    #import "your-package.typ"

    #show: mantys.with(
    	name:		"your-package-name",
    	title: 		[A title for the manual],
    	subtitle: 	[A subtitle for the manual],
    	info:		[A short descriptive text for the package.],
    	authors:	"Your Name",
    	url:		"https://github.com/repository/url",
    	version:	"0.0.1",
    	date:		"date-of-release",
    	abstract: 	[
    		A few paragraphs of text to describe the package.
    	],

    	example-imports: (your-package: your-package)
    )

    // end of preamble

    # About
    #lorem(50)

    # Usage
    #lorem(50)

    # Available commands
    #lorem(50)



Use ` #command(name, ..args)[description] ` to describe commands and `
#argument(name, ...)[description] ` for arguments:



    #command("headline", arg[color], arg(size:1.8em), sarg[other-args], barg[body])[
    	Renders a prominent headline using #doc("meta/heading").

    	#argument("color", type:"color")[
        The color of the headline will be used as the background of a #doc("layout/block") element containing the headline.
      ]
      #argument("size", default:1.8em)[
        The text size for the headline.
      ]
      #argument("sarg", is-sink:true)[
        Other options will get passed directly to #doc("meta/heading").
      ]
      #argument("body", type:"content")[
        The text for the headline.
      ]

      The headline is shown as a prominent colored block to highlight important news articles in the newsletter:

      #example[```
      #headline(blue, size: 2em, level: 3)[
        #lorem(8)
      ]
      ```]
    ]


The result might look something like this:

==  How to Compile

This project contains an example setup that splits individual chapters into
different files.
This can cause problems when using references etc.
These problems can be avoided by following these steps:

  - Make sure to always compile your ` main.typ ` file which includes all of your chapters for references to work correctly.
  - VSCode:
    - Install the [ Tinymist Typst ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extension.
    - Make sure to start the ` PDF ` or ` Live Preview ` only from within your ` main.typ ` file.
    - If problems occur it usually helps to close the preview and restart it from your ` main.typ ` file.

==  Examples

Examples can be found inside of the [ examples

==  Acronyms

This template provides functions to reference acronyms in the text. To use
these functions, you need to define the acronyms in the ` acronyms ` attribute
of the template. The acronyms referenced with the functions below will be
linked to their definition in the list of acronyms.

===  Functions

This template provides the following functions to reference acronyms:

` acr ` : Reference an acronym in the text (e.g. ` acr("API") ` -> `
Application Programming Interface (API) ` or ` API ` )

` acrpl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in plural form (e.g. `
acrpl("API") ` -> ` Application Programming Interfaces (API) ` or ` APIs ` )

` acrs ` : Reference an acronym in the text in short form (e.g. ` acrs("API")
` -> ` API ` )

` acrspl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in short form in plural form
(e.g. ` acrpl("API") ` -> ` APIs ` )

` acrl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in long form (e.g. ` acrl("API") `
-> ` Application Programming Interface ` )

` acrlpl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in long form in plural form
(e.g. ` acrlpl("API") ` -> ` Application Programming Interfaces ` )

` acrf ` : Reference an acronym in the text in full form (e.g. ` acrf("API") `
-> ` Application Programming Interface (API) ` )

` acrfpl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in full form in plural form
(e.g. ` acrfpl("API") ` -> ` Application Programming Interfaces (API) ` )

===  Definition

To define acronyms use a dictionary and pass it to the acronyms attribute of
the template. The dictionary should contain the acronyms as keys and their
long forms as values.



    #let acronyms = (
      API: "Application Programming Interface",
      HTTP: "Hypertext Transfer Protocol",
      REST: "Representational State Transfer",
    )


To define the plural form of an acronym use a array as value with the first
element being the singular form and the second element being the plural form.
If you donât define the plural form, the template will automatically add an
âsâ to the singular form.



    #let acronyms = (
      API: ("Application Programming Interface", "Application Programming Interfaces"),
      HTTP: ("Hypertext Transfer Protocol", "Hypertext Transfer Protocols"),
      REST: ("Representational State Transfer", "Representational State Transfers"),
    )


==  Glossary

Similar to the acronyms, this template provides a function to reference
glossary terms in the text. To use the function, you need to define the
glossary terms in the ` glossary ` attribute of the template. The glossary
terms referenced with the function below will be linked to their definition in
the list of glossary terms.

===  Reference

` gls ` : Reference a glossary term in the text (e.g. ` gls("Vulnerability") `
-> link to the definition of âVulnerabilityâ in the glossary)

===  Definition

The definition works analogously to the acronyms. Define the glossary terms in
a dictionary and pass it to the glossary attribute of the template. The
dictionary should contain the glossary terms as keys and their definitions as
values.



    #let glossary = (
      Vulnerability: "A Vulnerability is a flaw in a computer system that weakens the overall security of the system.",
      Patch: "A patch is data that is intended to be used to modify an existing software resource such as a program or a file, often to fix bugs and security vulnerabilities.",
      Exploit: "An exploit is a method or piece of code that takes advantage of vulnerabilities in software, applications, networks, operating systems, or hardware, typically for malicious purposes.",
    )

Convenient Rust-like string formatting in Typst

A Typst library that brings convenient string formatting and interpolation
through the ` strfmt ` function. Its syntax is taken directly from Rustâs `
format! ` syntax, so feel free to read its page for more information ( [
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/ ](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/) );
however, this README should have enough information and examples for all
expected uses of the library. Only a few things arenât supported from the
Rust syntax, such as the ` p ` (pointer) format type, or the ` .* ` precision
specifier.

A few extras (beyond the Rust-like syntax) will be added over time, though
(feel free to drop suggestions at the repository: [
https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-oxifmt ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-
oxifmt) ). The first âextraâ so far is the ` fmt-decimal-separator:
"string" ` parameter, which lets you customize the decimal separator for
decimal numbers (floats) inserted into strings. E.g. ` strfmt("Result: {}",
5.8, fmt-decimal-separator: ",") ` will return the string ` "Result: 5,8" `
(comma instead of dot). See more below.

*Compatible with:* [ Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) v0.4.0+

==  Usage

You can use this library through Typstâs package manager (for Typst
v0.6.0+):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt


For older Typst versions, download the ` oxifmt.typ ` file either from
Releases or directly from the repository. Then, move it to your projectâs
folder, and write at the top of your Typst file(s):



    #import "oxifmt.typ": strfmt


Doing the above will give you access to the main function provided by this
library ( ` strfmt ` ), which accepts a format string, followed by zero or
more replacements to insert in that string (according to ` {...} ` formats
inserted in that string), an optional ` fmt-decimal-separator ` parameter, and
returns the formatted string, as described below.

Its syntax is almost identical to Rustâs ` format! ` (as specified here: [
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/ ](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/) ).
You can escape formats by duplicating braces ( ` {{ ` and ` }} ` become ` { `
and ` } ` ). Hereâs an example (see more examples in the file `
tests/strfmt-tests.typ ` ):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("I'm {}. I have {num} cars. I'm {0}. {} is {{cool}}.", "John", "Carl", num: 10)
    #assert.eq(s, "I'm John. I have 10 cars. I'm John. Carl is {cool}.")


Note that ` {} ` extracts positional arguments after the string sequentially
(the first ` {} ` extracts the first one, the second ` {} ` extracts the
second one, and so on), while ` {0} ` , ` {1} ` , etc. will always extract the
first, the second etc. positional arguments after the string. Additionally, `
{bananas} ` will extract the named argument âbananasâ.

===  Formatting options

You can use ` {:spec} ` to customize your output. See the Rust docs linked
above for more info, but a summary is below.

(You may also want to check out the examples at [ Examples
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oxifmt/0.2.1/#examples)
.)

  - Adding a ` ? ` at the end of ` spec ` (that is, writing e.g. ` {0:?} ` ) will call ` repr() ` to stringify your argument, instead of ` str() ` . Note that this only has an effect if your argument is a string, an integer, a float or a ` label() ` / ` <label> ` \- for all other types (such as booleans or elements), ` repr() ` is always called (as ` str() ` is unsupported for those).
    - For strings, ` ? ` (and thus ` repr() ` ) has the effect of printing them with double quotes. For floats, this ensures a ` .0 ` appears after it, even if it doesnât have decimal digits. For integers, this doesnât change anything. Finally, for labels, the ` <label> ` (with ` ? ` ) is printed as ` <label> ` instead of ` label ` .
    - *TIP:* Prefer to always use ` ? ` when youâre inserting something that isnât a string, number or label, in order to ensure consistent results even if the library eventually changes the non- ` ? ` representation.
  - After the ` : ` , add e.g. ` _<8 ` to align the string to the left, padding it with as many ` _ ` s as necessary for it to be at least ` 8 ` characters long (for example). Replace ` < ` by ` > ` for right alignment, or ` ^ ` for center alignment. (If the ` _ ` is omitted, it defaults to â â (aligns with spaces).)
    - If you prefer to specify the minimum width (the ` 8 ` there) as a separate argument to ` strfmt ` instead, you can specify ` argument$ ` in place of the width, which will extract it from the integer at ` argument ` . For example, ` _^3$ ` will center align the output with ` _ ` s, where the minimum width desired is specified by the fourth positional argument (index ` 3 ` ), as an integer. This means that a call such as ` strfmt("{:_^3$}", 1, 2, 3, 4) ` would produce ` "__1__" ` , as ` 3$ ` would evaluate to ` 4 ` (the value at the fourth positional argument/index ` 3 ` ). Similarly, ` named$ ` would take the width from the argument with name ` named ` , if it is an integer (otherwise, error).
  - *For numbers:*
    - Specify ` + ` after the ` : ` to ensure zero or positive numbers are prefixed with ` + ` before them (instead of having no sign). ` - ` is also accepted but ignored (negative numbers always specify their sign anyways).
    - Use something like ` :09 ` to add zeroes to the left of the number until it has at least 9 digits / characters.
      - The ` 9 ` here is also a width, so the same comment from before applies (you can add ` $ ` to take it from an argument to the ` strfmt ` function).
    - Use ` :.5 ` to ensure your float is represented with 5 decimal digits of precision (zeroes are added to the right if needed; otherwise, it is rounded, *not truncated* ).
      - Note that floating point inaccuracies can be sometimes observed here, which is an unfortunate current limitation.
      - Similarly to ` width ` , the precision can also be specified via an argument with the ` $ ` syntax: ` .5$ ` will take the precision from the integer at argument number 5 (the sixth one), while ` .test$ ` will take it from the argument named ` test ` .
    - *Integers only:* Add ` x ` (lowercase hex) or ` X ` (uppercase) at the end of the ` spec ` to convert the number to hexadecimal. Also, ` b ` will convert it to binary, while ` o ` will convert to octal.
      - Specify a hashtag, e.g. ` #x ` or ` #b ` , to prepend the corresponding base prefix to the base-converted number, e.g. ` 0xABC ` instead of ` ABC ` .
    - Add ` e ` or ` E ` at the end of the ` spec ` to ensure the number is represented in scientific notation (with ` e ` or ` E ` as the exponent separator, respectively).
    - For decimal numbers (floats), you can specify ` fmt-decimal-separator: "," ` to ` strfmt ` to have the decimal separator be a comma instead of a dot, for example.
      - To have this be the default, you can alias ` strfmt ` , such as using ` #let strfmt = strfmt.with(fmt-decimal-separator: ",") ` .
    - Number spec arguments (such as ` .5 ` ) are ignored when the argument is not a number, but e.g. a string, even if it looks like a number (such as ` "5" ` ).
  - Note that all spec arguments above *have to be specified in order* \- if you mix up the order, it wonât work properly!
    - Check the grammar below for the proper order, but, in summary: fill (character) with align ( ` < ` , ` > ` or ` ^ ` ) -> sign ( ` + ` or ` - ` ) -> ` # ` -> ` 0 ` (for 0 left-padding of numbers) -> width (e.g. ` 8 ` from ` 08 ` or ` 9 ` from ` -<9 ` ) -> ` .precision ` -> spec type ( ` ? ` , ` x ` , ` X ` , ` b ` , ` o ` , ` e ` , ` E ` )).

Some examples:



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s1 = strfmt("{0:?}, {test:+012e}, {1:-<#8x}", "hi", -74, test: 569.4)
    #assert.eq(s1, "\"hi\", +00005.694e2, -0x4a---")

    #let s2 = strfmt("{:_>+11.5}", 59.4)
    #assert.eq(s2, "__+59.40000")

    #let s3 = strfmt("Dict: {:!<10?}", (a: 5))
    #assert.eq(s3, "Dict: (a: 5)!!!!")


===  Examples

  - *Inserting labels, text and numbers into strings:*



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("First: {}, Second: {}, Fourth: {3}, Banana: {banana} (brackets: {{escaped}})", 1, 2.1, 3, label("four"), banana: "Banana!!")
    #assert.eq(s, "First: 1, Second: 2.1, Fourth: four, Banana: Banana!! (brackets: {escaped})")


  - *Forcing` repr() ` with ` {:?} ` * (which adds quotes around strings, and other things - basically represents a Typst value):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("The value is: {:?} | Also the label is {:?}", "something", label("label"))
    #assert.eq(s, "The value is: \"something\" | Also the label is <label>")


  - *Inserting other types than numbers and strings* (for now, they will always use ` repr() ` , even without ` {...:?} ` , although that is more explicit):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Values: {:?}, {1:?}, {stuff:?}", (test: 500), ("a", 5.1), stuff: [a])
    #assert.eq(s, "Values: (test: 500), (\"a\", 5.1), [a]")


  - *Padding to a certain width with characters:* Use ` {:x<8} ` , where ` x ` is the *character to pad with* (e.g. space or ` _ ` , but can be anything), ` < ` is the *alignment of the original text* relative to the padding (can be ` < ` for left aligned (padding goes to the right), ` > ` for right aligned (padded to its left) and ` ^ ` for center aligned (padded at both left and right)), and ` 8 ` is the *desired total width* (padding will add enough characters to reach this width; if the replacement string already has this width, no padding will be added):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Left5 {:-<5}, Right6 {:=>6}, Center10 {centered: ^10?}, Left3 {tleft:_<3}", "xx", 539, tleft: "okay", centered: [a])
    #assert.eq(s, "Left5 xx---, Right6 ===539, Center10     [a]    , Left3 okay")
    // note how 'okay' didn't suffer any padding at all (it already had at least the desired total width).


  - *Padding numbers with zeroes to the left:* Itâs a similar functionality to the above, however you write ` {:08} ` for 8 characters (for instance) - note that any characters in the numberâs representation matter for width (including sign, dot and decimal part):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Left-padded7 numbers: {:07} {:07} {:07} {3:07}", 123, -344, 44224059, 45.32)
    #assert.eq(s, "Left-padded7 numbers: 0000123 -000344 44224059 0045.32")


  - *Defining padding-to width using parameters, not literals:* If you want the desired replacement width (the ` 8 ` in ` {:08} ` or ` {: ^8} ` ) to be passed via parameter (instead of being hardcoded into the format string), you can specify ` parameter$ ` in place of the width, e.g. ` {:02$} ` to take it from the third positional parameter, or ` {:a>banana$} ` to take it from the parameter named ` banana ` \- note that the chosen parameter *must be an integer* (desired total width):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Padding depending on parameter: {0:02$} and {0:a>banana$}", 432, 0, 5, banana: 9)
    #assert.eq(s, "Padding depending on parameter: 00432 aaaaaa432")  // widths 5 and 9


  - *Displaying` + ` on positive numbers: * Just add a ` + ` at the âbeginningâ, i.e., before the ` #0 ` (if either is there), or after the custom fill and align (if itâs there and not ` 0 ` \- see [ Grammar ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oxifmt/0.2.1/#grammar) for the exact positioning), like so:



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Some numbers: {:+} {:+08}; With fill and align: {:_<+8}; Negative (no-op): {neg:+}", 123, 456, 4444, neg: -435)
    #assert.eq(s, "Some numbers: +123 +0000456; With fill and align: +4444___; Negative (no-op): -435")



  - *Converting numbers to bases 2, 8 and 16:* Use one of the following specifier types (i.e., characters which always go at the very end of the format): ` b ` (binary), ` o ` (octal), ` x ` (lowercase hexadecimal) or ` X ` (uppercase hexadecimal). You can also add a ` # ` between ` + ` and ` 0 ` (see the exact position at the [ Grammar ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oxifmt/0.2.1/#grammar) ) to display a *base prefix* before the number (i.e. ` 0b ` for binary, ` 0o ` for octal and ` 0x ` for hexadecimal):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Bases (10, 2, 8, 16(l), 16(U):) {0} {0:b} {0:o} {0:x} {0:X} | W/ prefixes and modifiers: {0:#b} {0:+#09o} {0:_>+#9X}", 124)
    #assert.eq(s, "Bases (10, 2, 8, 16(l), 16(U):) 124 1111100 174 7c 7C | W/ prefixes and modifiers: 0b1111100 +0o000174 ____+0x7C")


  - *Picking float precision (right-extending with zeroes):* Add, at the end of the format (just before the spec type (such as ` ? ` ), if thereâs any), either ` .precision ` (hardcoded, e.g. ` .8 ` for 8 decimal digits) or ` .parameter$ ` (taking the precision value from the specified parameter, like with ` width ` ):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("{0:.8} {0:.2$} {0:.potato$}", 1.234, 0, 2, potato: 5)
    #assert.eq(s, "1.23400000 1.23 1.23400")


  - *Scientific notation:* Use ` e ` (lowercase) or ` E ` (uppercase) as specifier types (can be combined with precision):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("{0:e} {0:E} {0:+.9e} | {1:e} | {2:.4E}", 124.2312, 50, -0.02)
    #assert.eq(s, "1.242312e2 1.242312E2 +1.242312000e2 | 5e1 | -2.0000E-2")


  - *Customizing the decimal separator on floats:* Just specify ` fmt-decimal-separator: "," ` (comma as an example):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("{0} {0:.6} {0:.5e}", 1.432, fmt-decimal-separator: ",")
    #assert.eq(s, "1,432 1,432000 1,43200e0")


===  Grammar

Hereâs the grammar specification for valid format ` spec ` s (in `
{name:spec} ` ), which is basically Rustâs format:



    format_spec := [[fill]align][sign]['#']['0'][width]['.' precision]type
    fill := character
    align := '<' | '^' | '>'
    sign := '+' | '-'
    width := count
    precision := count | '*'
    type := '' | '?' | 'x?' | 'X?' | identifier
    count := parameter | integer
    parameter := argument '$'


Note, however, that precision of type ` .* ` is not supported yet and will
raise an error.

(please ensure youâre using a supported Typst version).

==  Changelog

===  v0.2.1

  - Fixed formatting of UTF-8 strings. Before, strings with multi-byte UTF-8 codepoints would cause formatting inconsistencies or even crashes. ( [ Issue #6 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-oxifmt/issues/6) )
  - Fixed an inconsistency in negative number formatting. Now, it will always print a regular hyphen (e.g. â-2â), which is consistent with Rustâs behavior; before, it would occasionally print a minus sign instead (as observed in a comment to [ Issue #4 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-oxifmt/issues/4) ).
  - Added compatibility with Typst 0.8.0âs new type system.

===  v0.2.0

  - The packageâs name is now ` oxifmt ` !
  - ` oxifmt:0.2.0 ` is now available through Typstâs Package Manager! You can now write ` #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.0": strfmt ` to use the library.
  - Greatly improved the README, adding a section for common examples.
  - Fixed negative numbers being formatted with two minus signs.
  - Fixed custom precision of floats not working when they are exact integers.

===  v0.1.0

  - Initial release, added ` strfmt ` .

0.1.0

Excellently type-set a fun little zine!

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=zen-zine&version=0.1.0)

Excellently type-set a cute little zine about your favorite topic!

Providing your eight pages in order will produce a US-Letter page with the
content in a layout ready to be folded into a zine! The content is wrapped
before movement so that padding and alignment are respected.

Here is the template and its preview:



    #import "@preview/zen-zine:0.1.0": zine

    #set document(author: "Tom", title: "Zen Zine Example")
    #set text(font: "Linux Libertine", lang: "en")

    #let my_eight_pages = (
      range(8).map(
        number => [
          #pad(2em, text(10em, align(center, str(number))))
        ]
      )
    )

    // provide your content pages in order and they
    // are placed into the zine template positions.
    // the content is wrapped before movement so that
    // padding and alignment are respected.
    #zine(
      // draw_border: true,
      // zine_page_margin: 5pt,

    )


![Image of

==  Improvement Ideas

Roughly in order of priority.

  - Write documentation and generate a manual
  - Deduce ` page ` properties so that user can change the page they wish to use.
    - Make sure the page is ` flipped ` and deduce the zine page width and height from the full page width and height (and the zine margin)
    - Iâm currently struggling with finding out the page properties (whatâs the ` #get ` equivalent to ` #set ` ?)
  - Add other zine sizes (there is a 16 page one I believe?)
  - Digital mode where zine pages are separate pages (of the same size) rather than âsub pagesâ of a printer page

=  minideck

0.2.1

Simple dynamic slides.

A small package for dynamic slides in typst.

minideck provides basic functionality for dynamic slides ( ` pause ` , `
uncover ` , â¦), integration with [ fletcher
](https://typst.app/universe/package/fletcher) and [ CetZ
](https://typst.app/universe/package/cetz/) , and some minimal infrastructure
for theming.

==  Usage

Call ` minideck.config ` to get the functions you want to use:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide, title-slide, pause, uncover, only) = minideck.config()
    #show: template

    #title-slide[
      = Slides with `minideck`
      == Some examples
      John Doe

      #datetime.today().display()
    ]

    #slide[
      = Some title

      Some content

      #show: pause

      More content

      1. One
      2. Two
      #show: pause
      3. Three
    ]


This will show three subslides with progressively more content. (Note that the
default theme uses the font Libertinus Sans from the [ Libertinus
](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus) family, so you may want to install
it.)

Instead of ` #show: pause ` , you can use ` #uncover(2,3)[...] ` to make
content visible only on subslides 2 and 3, or ` #uncover(from: 2)[...] ` to
have it visible on subslide 2 and following.

The ` only ` function is similar to ` uncover ` , but instead of hiding the
content (without affecting the layout), it removes it.



    #slide[
      = `uncover` and `only`

      #uncover(1, from:3)[
        Content visible on subslides 1 and 3+
        (space reserved on 2).
      ]

      #only(2,3)[
        Content included on subslides 2 and 3
        (no space reserved on 1).
      ]

      Content always visible.
    ]


Contrary to ` pause ` , the ` uncover ` and ` only ` functions also work in
math mode:



    #slide[
      = Dynamic equation

      $
        f(x) &= x^2 + 2x + 1  \
             #uncover(2, $&= (x + 1)^2$)
      $
    ]


When mixing ` pause ` with ` uncover ` / ` only ` , the sequence of pauses
should be taken as reference for the meaning of subslide indices. For example
content after the first pause always appears on the second subslide, even if
itâs preceded by a call to ` #uncover(from: 3)[...] ` .

The package also works well with [ pinit
](https://typst.app/universe/package/pinit) :



    #import "@preview/pinit:0.1.4": *

    #slide[
      = Works well with `pinit`

      Pythagorean theorem:

      $ #pin(1)a^2#pin(2) + #pin(3)b^2#pin(4) = #pin(5)c^2#pin(6) $

      #show: pause

      $a^2$ and $b^2$ : squares of triangle legs

      #only(2, {
        pinit-highlight(1,2)
        pinit-highlight(3,4)
      })

      #show: pause

      $c^2$ : square of hypotenuse

      #pinit-highlight(5,6, fill: green.transparentize(80%))
      #pinit-point-from(6)[larger than $a^2$ and $b^2$]
    ]


===  Handout mode

minideck can make a handout version of the document, in which dynamic behavior
is disabled: the content of all subslides is shown together in a single slide.

To compile a handout version, pass ` --input handout=true ` in the command
line:



    typst compile --input handout=true myfile.typ


It is also possible to enable handout mode from within the document, as shown
in the next section.

===  Configuration

The behavior of the minideck functions depends on the settings passed to `
minideck.config ` . For example, handout mode can also be enabled like this:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide, pause) = minideck.config(handout: true)
    #show: template

    #slide[
      = Slide title

      Some text

      #show: pause

      More text
    ]


(The default value of ` handout ` is ` auto ` , in which case minideck checks
for a command line setting as in the previous section.)

` minideck.config ` accepts the following named arguments:

  - ` paper ` : a string for one of the paper size names recognized by [ ` page.paper ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-paper) , or one of the shorthands ` "16:9" ` or ` "4:3" ` . Default: ` "4:3" ` .
  - ` landscape ` : use the paper size in landscape orientation. Default: ` true ` .
  - ` width ` : page width as an absolute length. Takes precedence over ` paper ` and ` landscape ` .
  - ` height ` : page height as an absolute length. Takes precedence over ` paper ` and ` landscape ` .
  - ` handout ` : whether to make a document for handout, with content of all subslides shown together in a single slide.
  - ` theme ` : the theme (see below).
  - ` cetz ` : the CeTZ module (see below).
  - ` fletcher ` : the fletcher module (see below).

For example to make slides with 16:9 aspect ratio, use `
minideck.config(paper: "16:9") ` .

===  Themes

Use ` minideck.config(theme: ...) ` to select a theme. Currently there is only
one built-in: ` minideck.themes.simple ` . However you can also pass a theme
implemented by yourself or from a third-party package. See the [ theme
documentation
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/minideck/0.2.1/themes/README.md)
for how that works.

Themes are functions and can be configured using the standard [ ` with `
method ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/#definitions-
with) :

  - The ` simple ` theme has a ` variant ` setting with values âlightâ (default) and âdarkâ.

Hereâs an example:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide) = minideck.config(
      theme: minideck.themes.simple.with(variant: "dark"),
    )
    #show: template

    #slide[
      = Slide with dark theme

      Some text
    ]


Note that you can override part of a theme with show and set rules:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide) = minideck.config(
      theme: minideck.themes.simple.with(variant: "dark"),
    )
    #show: template

    #set page(footer: none) // get rid of the page number
    #show heading: it => text(style: "italic", it)
    #set text(red)

    #slide[
      = Slide with dark theme and red text

      Some text
    ]


===  Integration with CeTZ

You can use ` uncover ` and ` only ` (but not ` pause ` ) in CeTZ figures,
with the following extra steps:

  - Get CeTZ-specific functions ` cetz-uncover ` and ` cetz-only ` by passing the CeTZ module to ` minideck.config ` (see example below).

This ensures that minideck uses CeTZ functions from the correct version of
CeTZ.

  - Add a ` context ` keyword outside the ` canvas ` call.

This is required to access the minideck subslide state from within the canvas
without making the content opaque (CeTZ needs to inspect the canvas content to
make the drawing).

Example:



    #import "@preview/cetz:0.2.2" as cetz: *
    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide, only, cetz-uncover, cetz-only) = minideck.config(cetz: cetz)
    #show: template

    #slide[
      = In a CeTZ figure

      Above canvas
      #context canvas({
        import draw: *
        cetz-only(3, rect((0,-2), (14,4), stroke: 3pt))
        cetz-uncover(from: 2, rect((0,-2), (16,2), stroke: blue+3pt))
        content((8,0), box(stroke: red+3pt, inset: 1em)[
          A typst box #only(2)[on 2nd subslide]
        ])
      })
      Below canvas
    ]


===  Integration with fletcher

The same steps are required as for CeTZ integration (passing the fletcher
module to get fletcher-specific functions), plus an additional step:

  - Give explicitly the number of subslides to the ` slide ` function.

This is required because I could not find a reliable way to update a typst
state from within a fletcher diagram, so I cannot rely on the state to keep
track of the number of subslides.

Example:



    #import "@preview/fletcher:0.5.0" as fletcher: diagram, node, edge
    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"
    #let (template, slide, fletcher-uncover) = minideck.config(fletcher: fletcher)
    #show: template

    #slide(steps: 2)[
      = In a fletcher diagram

      #set align(center)

      Above diagram

      #context diagram(
        node-stroke: 1pt,
        node((0,0), [Start], corner-radius: 2pt, extrude: (0, 3)),
        edge("-|>"),
        node((1,0), align(center)[A]),
        fletcher-uncover(from: 2, edge("d,r,u,l", "-|>", [x], label-pos: 0.1))
      )

      Below diagram
    ]


==  Comparison with other slides packages

Performance: minideck is currently faster than [ Polylux
](https://typst.app/universe/package/polylux/) when using ` pause ` ,
especially for incremental compilation, but a bit slower than [ Touying
](https://typst.app/universe/package/touying) , according to my tests.

Features: Polylux and Touying have more themes and more features, for example
support for [ pdfpc ](https://pdfpc.github.io/) which provides speaker notes
and more. Minideck allows using ` uncover ` and ` only ` in CeTZ figures and
fletcher diagrams, which Polylux currently doesnât support.

Syntax: package configuration is simpler in minideck than Touying but a bit
more involved than in Polylux. The minideck ` pause ` is more cumbersome to
use: one must write ` #show: pause ` instead of ` #pause ` . On the other hand
minideckâs ` uncover ` and ` only ` can be used directly in equations
without requiring a special math environment as in Touying (I think).

Other: minideck sometimes has better error messages than Touying due to
implementation differences: the minideck stack trace points back to the
userâs code while Touying errors sometimes point only to an output page
number.

==  Limitations

  - ` pause ` , ` uncover ` and ` only ` work in enumerations but they require explicit enum indices ( ` 1. ... ` rather than ` + ... ` ) as they cause a reset of the list index.
  - Usage in a CeTZ canvas or fletcher diagram requires a ` context ` keyword in front of the ` canvas ` / ` diagram ` call (see above).
  - fletcher diagrams also require to specify the number of subslides explicitly (see above).
  - ` pause ` doesnât work in CeTZ figures, fletcher diagrams and math mode.
  - ` pause ` requires writing ` #show: pause ` and its effect is lost after the ` #show ` call goes out of scope. For example this means that one can use ` pause ` inside of a grid, but further ` pause ` calls after the grid (in the same slide) wonât work as intended.

==  Internals

The package uses states with the following keys:

` __minideck-subslide-count ` : an array of two integers for counting pauses
and keeping track of the subslide number automatically. The first value is the
number of subslides so far referenced in current slide. The second value is
the number of pauses seen so far in the current slide. Both values are kept in
one state so that an update function can update the number of subslides based
on the number of pauses, without requiring a context. This avoids problems
with layout convergence.

` __minideck-subslide-step ` : the current subslide being generated while
processing a slide.

= *ez-today.md*

=  ez-today

0.1.0

Simply displays the full current date.

Simply displays the current date with easy to use customization.

==  Included languages

German, English, French and Italian months can be used out of the box. If you
want to use a language that is not included, you can easily add it yourself.
This is shown in the customization section below.

==  Usage

The usage is very simple, because there is only the ` today() ` function.



    #import "@preview/ez-today:0.1.0"

    // To get the current date use this
    #ez-today.today()


==  Reference

===  ` today `

Prints the current date with given arguments.



    #let today(
      lang: "de",
      format: "d. M Y",
      custom-months: ()
    ) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` lang ` : [ ` str ` ] â Select one of the included languages (de, en, fr, it).
  - ` format ` : [ ` str ` ] â Specify the output format.
  - ` custom-months ` : [ ` array ` ] of [ ` str ` ] â Use custom names for each month. This array must have 12 entries. If this is used, the ` lang ` argument does nothing.

==  Customization

The default output prints the full current date with German months like this:



    #ez-today.today()   // 11. Oktober 2024


You can choose one of the included languages with the ` lang ` argument:



    #ez-today.today(lang: "en")   // 11. October 2024
    #ez-today.today(lang: "fr")   // 11. Octobre 2024
    #ez-today.today(lang: "it")   // 11. Ottobre 2024


You can also change the format of the output with the ` format ` argument.
Pass any string you want here, but know that the following characters will be
replaced with the following:

  - ` d ` â The current day as a decimal
  - ` m ` â The current month as a decimal ( ` lang ` argument does nothing)
  - ` M ` â The current month as a string with either the selected language or the custom array
  - ` y ` â The current year as a decimal with the last two numbers
  - ` Y ` â The current year as a decimal

Here are some examples:



    #ez-today.today(lang: "en", format: "M d Y")    // October 11 2024
    #ez-today.today(format: "m-d-y")                // 10-11-24
    #ez-today.today(format: "d/m")                  // 11/10
    #ez-today.today(format: "d.m.Y")                // 11.10.2024


Use the ` custom-months ` argument to give each month a custom name. You can
add a new language or use short terms for each month.



    // Defining some custom names
    #let my-months = ("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
    // Get current date with custom names
    #ez-today.today(custom-months: my-months, format: "M-y")    // Oct-24


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` ez-today `



    #import "@preview/ez-today:0.1.0"

  2. Get the values of the ` cardnumber ` counter, and ` cardheader ` , ` cardfooter ` , ` cardquestion ` , ` cardanswer ` states at each ` <card> ` .
  3. Populates an array of questions and an array of answers using these values
     - The ` #a48up ` and ` #letter8up ` functions describe the layout of each card for each item in these arrays, and also rearrange the answers so that the layout makes sense when printed double sided.
  4. Loop over the arrays and dump each itemâs ` content ` onto the page.
     - in the case of ` #a48up ` and ` letter8up ` , each item is dumped into a 2-column table.

` cartao ` comes builtin with the following card building functions. Take a
look at the source for how they work, and use them as a guide to help you
build your own flashcards with different sizes/formats.

0.1.0

Easy, composable tabular data manipulation

TaDa provides a set of simple but powerful operations on rows of data. A full
manual is available online: [ https://github.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/blob/v0.1.0/docs/manual.pdf ](https://github.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/blob/v0.1.0/docs/manual.pdf)

Key features include:

  - *Arithmetic expressions* : Row-wise operations are as simple as string expressions with field names

  - *Aggregation* : Any function that operates on an array of values can perform row-wise or column-wise aggregation

  - *Data representation* : Handle displaying currencies, floats, integers, and more with ease and arbitrary customization

Note: This library is in early development. The API is subject to change
especially as typst adds more support for user-defined types. *Backwards
compatibility is not guaranteed!* Handling of field info, value types, and
more may change substantially with more user feedback.

==  Importing

TaDa can be imported as follows:

===  From the official packages repository (recommended):



    #import "@preview/tada:0.1.0"


===  From the source code (not recommended)

*Option 1:* You can clone the package directly into your project directory:



    # In your project directory
    git clone https://github.com/ntjess/typst-tada.git tada


Then import the functionality with



    #import "./tada/lib.typ"


*Option 2:* If Python is available on your system, use the provided
packaging script to install TaDa in typstâs ` local ` directory:



    # Anywhere on your system
      git clone https://github.com/ntjess/typst-tada.git
      cd typst-tada

      # Replace $XDG_CACHE_HOME with the appropriate directory based on
      # https://github.com/typst/packages#downloads
      python package.py ./typst.toml "$XDG_CACHE_HOME/typst/packages" \
        --namespace local



Now, TaDa is available under the local namespace:



    #import "@local/tada:0.1.0"


==  Creation

TaDa provides three main ways to construct tables â from columns, rows, or
records.

  - *Columns* are a dictionary of field names to column values. Alternatively, a 2D array of columns can be passed to ` from-columns ` , where ` values.at(0) ` is a column (belongs to one field).

  - *Records* are a 1D array of dictionaries where each dictionary is a row.

  - *Rows* are a 2D array where ` values.at(0) ` is a row (has one value for each field). Note that if ` rows ` are given without field names, they default to (0, 1, â¦$n$).



    #let column-data = (
      name: ("Bread", "Milk", "Eggs"),
      price: (1.25, 2.50, 1.50),
      quantity: (2, 1, 3),
    )
    #let record-data = (
      (name: "Bread", price: 1.25, quantity: 2),
      (name: "Milk", price: 2.50, quantity: 1),
      (name: "Eggs", price: 1.50, quantity: 3),
    )
    #let row-data = (
      ("Bread", 1.25, 2),
      ("Milk", 2.50, 1),
      ("Eggs", 1.50, 3),
    )

    #import tada: TableData
    #let td = TableData(data: column-data)
    // Equivalent to:
    #let td2 = tada.from-records(record-data)
    // _Not_ equivalent to (since field names are unknown):
    #let td3 = tada.from-rows(row-data)

    #to-tablex(td)
    #to-tablex(td2)
    #to-tablex(td3)


![Example 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-01.png)

==  Title formatting

You can pass any ` content ` as a fieldâs ` title ` . *Note* : if you pass
a string, it will be evaluated as markup.



    #let fmt(it) = {
      heading(outlined: false,
        upper(it.at(0))
        + it.slice(1).replace("_", " ")
      )
    }

    #let titles = (
      // As a function
      name: (title: fmt),
      // As a string
      quantity: (title: fmt("Qty")),
    )
    #let td = TableData(..td, field-info: titles)

    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-02.png)

==  Adapting default behavior

You can specify defaults for any field not explicitly populated by passing
information to ` field-defaults ` . Observe in the last example that ` price `
was not given a title. We can indicate it should be formatted the same as `
name ` by passing ` title: fmt ` to ` field-defaults ` . *Note* that any
field that is explicitly given a value will not be affected by ` field-
defaults ` (i.e., ` quantity ` will retain its string title âQtyâ)



    #let defaults = (title: fmt)
    #let td = TableData(..td, field-defaults: defaults)
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-03.png)

==  Using ` __index `

TaDa will automatically add an ` __index ` field to each row that is hidden by
default. If you want it displayed, update its information to set ` hide: false
` :



    // Use the helper function `update-fields` to update multiple fields
    // and/or attributes
    #import tada: update-fields
    #let td = update-fields(
      td, __index: (hide: false, title: "\#")
    )
    // You can also insert attributes directly:
    // #td.field-info.__index.insert("hide", false)
    // etc.
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-04.png)

==  Value formatting

===  ` type `

Type information can have attached metadata that specifies alignment, display
formats, and more. Available types and their metadata are:

  - *string* : (default-value: "", align: left)

  - *content* : (display: , align: left)

  - *float* : (align: right)

  - *integer* : (align: right)

  - *percent* : (display: , align: right)

  - *index* : (align: right)

While adding your own default types is not yet supported, you can simply
defined a dictionary of specifications and pass its keys to the field



    #let currency-info = (
      display: tada.display.format-usd, align: right
    )
    #td.field-info.insert("price", (type: "currency"))
    #let td = TableData(..td, type-info: ("currency": currency-info))
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-05.png)

==  Transposing

` transpose ` is supported, but keep in mind if columns have different types,
an error will be a frequent result. To avoid the error, explicitly pass `
ignore-types: true ` . You can choose whether to keep field names as an
additional column by passing a string to ` fields-name ` that is evaluated as
markup:



    #to-tablex(
      tada.transpose(
        td, ignore-types: true, fields-name: ""
      )
    )


![Example 6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-06.png)

===  ` display `

If your type is not available or you want to customize its display, pass a `
display ` function that formats the value, or a string that accesses ` value `
in its scope:



    #td.field-info.at("quantity").insert(
      "display",
      val => ("/", "One", "Two", "Three").at(val),
    )

    #let td = TableData(..td)
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-07.png)

===  ` align ` etc.

You can pass ` align ` and ` width ` to a given fieldâs metadata to
determine how content aligns in the cell and how much horizontal space it
takes up. In the future, more ` tablex ` setup arguments will be accepted.



    #let adjusted = update-fields(
      td, name: (align: center, width: 1.4in)
    )
    #to-tablex(adjusted)


![Example 8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-08.png)

==  Deeper ` tablex ` customization

TaDa uses ` tablex ` to display the table. So any argument that ` tablex `
accepts can be passed to TableData as well:



    #let mapper = (index, row) => {
      let fill = if index == 0 {rgb("#8888")} else {none}
      row.map(cell => (..cell, fill: fill))
    }
    #let td = TableData(
      ..td,
      tablex-kwargs: (
        map-rows: mapper, auto-vlines: false
      ),
    )
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-09.png)

==  Subselection

You can select a subset of fields or rows to display:



    #import tada: subset
    #to-tablex(
      subset(td, indexes: (0,2), fields: ("name", "price"))
    )


![Example 10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-10.png)

Note that ` indexes ` is based on the tableâs ` __index ` column, _not_
itâs positional index within the table:



    #let td2 = td
    #td2.data.insert("__index", (1, 2, 2))
    #to-tablex(
      subset(td2, indexes: 2, fields: ("__index", "name"))
    )


![Example 11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-11.png)

Rows can also be selected by whether they fulfill a field condition:



    #to-tablex(
      tada.filter(td, expression: "price < 1.5")
    )


![Example 12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-12.png)

==  Concatenation

Concatenating rows and columns are both supported operations, but only in the
simple sense of stacking the data. Currently, there is no ability to join on a
field or otherwise intelligently merge data.

  - ` axis: 0 ` places new rows below current rows

  - ` axis: 1 ` places new columns to the right of current columns

  - Unless you specify a fill value for missing values, the function will panic if the tables do not match exactly along their concatenation axis.

  - You cannot stack with ` axis: 1 ` unless every column has a unique field name.



    #import tada: stack

    #let td2 = TableData(
      data: (
        name: ("Cheese", "Butter"),
        price: (2.50, 1.75),
      )
    )
    #let td3 = TableData(
      data: (
        rating: (4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5),
      )
    )

    // This would fail without specifying the fill
    // since `quantity` is missing from `td2`
    #let stack-a = stack(td, td2, missing-fill: 0)
    #let stack-b = stack(stack-a, td3, axis: 1)
    #to-tablex(stack-b)


![Example 13](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-13.png)

==  Expressions

The easiest way to leverage TaDaâs flexibility is through expressions. They
can be strings that treat field names as variables, or functions that take
keyword-only arguments.

  - *Note* ! When passing functions, every field is passed as a named argument to the function. So, make sure to capture unused fields with ` ..rest ` (the name is unimportant) to avoid errors.



    #let make-dict(field, expression) = {
      let out = (:)
      out.insert(
        field,
        (expression: expression, type: "currency"),
      )
      out
    }

    #let td = update-fields(
      td, ..make-dict("total", "price * quantity" )
    )

    #let tax-expr(total: none, ..rest) = { total * 0.2 }
    #let taxed = update-fields(
      td, ..make-dict("tax", tax-expr),
    )

    #to-tablex(
      subset(taxed, fields: ("name", "total", "tax"))
    )


![Example 14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-14.png)

==  Chaining

It is inconvenient to require several temporary variables as above, or deep
function nesting, to perform multiple operations on a table. TaDa provides a `
chain ` function to make this easier. Furthermore, when you need to compute
several fields at once and donât need extra field information, you can use `
add-expressions ` as a shorthand:



    #import tada: chain, add-expressions
    #let totals = chain(td,
      add-expressions.with(
        total: "price * quantity",
        tax: "total * 0.2",
        after-tax: "total + tax",
      ),
      subset.with(
        fields: ("name", "total", "after-tax")
      ),
      // Add type information
      update-fields.with(
        after-tax: (type: "currency", title: fmt("w/ Tax")),
      ),
    )
    #to-tablex(totals)


![Example 15](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-15.png)

==  Sorting

You can sort by ascending/descending values of any field, or provide your own
transformation function to the ` key ` argument to customize behavior further:



    #import tada: sort-values
    #to-tablex(sort-values(
      td, by: "quantity", descending: true
    ))


![Example 16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-16.png)

==  Aggregation

Column-wise reduction is supported through ` agg ` , using either functions or
string expressions:



    #import tada: agg, item
    #let grand-total = chain(
      totals,
      agg.with(after-tax: array.sum),
      // use "item" to extract exactly one element
      item
    )
    // "Output" is a helper function just for these docs.
    // It is not necessary in your code.
    #output[
      *Grand total: #tada.display.format-usd(grand-total)*
    ]


![Example 17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-17.png)

It is also easy to aggregate several expressions at once:



    #let agg-exprs = (
      "# items": "quantity.sum()",
      "Longest name": "[#name.sorted(key: str.len).at(-1)]",
    )
    #let agg-td = tada.agg(td, ..agg-exprs)
    #to-tablex(agg-td)

tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-18.png)

0.0.5

Numeric Typst

==  Numty

===  Numeric Typst

A library for performing mathematical operations on n-dimensional matrices,
vectors/arrays, and numbers in Typst, with support for broadcasting and
handling NaN values. Numtyâs broadcasting rules and API are inspired by
NumPy.



    #import "numty.typ" as nt

    // Define vectors and matrices
    #let a = (1, 2, 3)
    #let b = 2
    #let m = ((1, 2), (1, 3))

    // Element-wise operations with broadcasting
    #nt.mult(a, b)  // Multiply vector 'a' by scalar 'b': (2, 4, 6)
    #nt.add(a, a)   // Add two vectors: (2, 4, 6)
    #nt.add(2, a)   // Add scalar '2' to each element of vector 'a': (3, 4, 5)
    #nt.add(m, 1)   // Add scalar '1' to each element of matrix 'm': ((2, 3), (2, 4))

    // Dot product of vectors
    #nt.dot(a, a)   // Dot product of vector 'a' with itself: 14

    // Handling NaN cases in mathematical functions
    #calc.sin((3, 4)) // Fails, as Typst does not support vector operations directly
    #nt.sin((3.4))    // Sine of each element in vector: (0.14411, 0.90929)

    // Generate equally spaced values and vectorized functions
    #let x = nt.linspace(0, 10, 3)  // Generate 3 equally spaced values between 0 and 10: (0, 5, 10)
    #let y = nt.sin(x)              // Apply sine function to each element: (0, -0.95, -0.54)

    // Logical operations
    #nt.eq(a, b)      // Compare each element in 'a' to 'b': (false, true, false)
    #nt.any(nt.eq(a, b)) // Check if any element in 'a' equals 'b': true
    #nt.all(nt.eq(a, b)) // Check if all elements in 'a' equal 'b': false

    // Handling special cases like division by zero
    #nt.div((1, 3), (2, 0))  // Element-wise division, with NaN for division by zero: (0.5, float.nan)

    // Matrix operations (element-wise)
    #nt.add(m, 1)  // Add scalar to matrix elements: ((2, 3), (2, 4))

    // matrix
    #nt.transpose(m)  // transposition
    #nt.matmul(m,m) //  matrix multipliation
    #nt.matmul(c(1,2), r(2,3)) //  colum vector times row vector multiplication.
    #np.trace(m) // trace
    #np.det(m) /2x2 determinant

    // printing
    #nt.print(m, " != " , (1,2))  // long dollar print, see in pdf
    #nt.p(m, " != " , (1,2))  //  short long print print, see in pdf


Since vesion 0.0.4 n-dim matrices are supported as well in most operations.

==  Supported Features:

===  Dimensions:

Numty uses standard typst list as a base type, most 1d operations like dot are
suported directly for them.

For matrix specific operations we use 2d arrays / nested arrays, that are also
the standard typst list, but nested like in: ((1,2), (1,1)).

For convenience you can create column or row vectors with the #nt.c and #nt.r
functions.



    #import "numty.typ" as nt
    #import "numty.typ": c, r

    #let a = (1,2,3)
    #let b = (3,2,1)
    #c(..a) // ((1,),(2,),(3,))
    #r(..b) // ((3,2,1),)
    #nt.matmul(c(..a), r(..b)) // column @ row



===  Logic Operations:



    #let a = (1,2,3)
    #let b = 2

    #nt.eq(a,b)  // (false, true, false)
    #nt.all(nt.eq(a,b))  // false
    #nt.any(nt.eq(a,b))  // true


===  Math operators:

All operators are element-wise, traditional matrix multiplication is not yet
supported.



    #nt.add((0,1,3), 1)  // (1,2,4)
    #nt.mult((1,3),(2,2)) // (2,6)
    #nt.div((1,3), (2,0)) // (0.5,float.nan)


===  Algebra with Nan handling:



    #nt.log((0,1,3)) //  (float.nan, 0 , 0.47...)
    #nt.sin((1,3)) //  (0.84.. , 0.14...)


===  Vector operations:

Basic vector operations



    #nt.dot((1,2),(2,4))  //  9
    #nt.normalize((1,4), l:1) // (1/5,4/5)


===  Others:

Functions for creating equally spaced indexes in linear and logspace, usefull
for log plots, to sample in acordance to the logarithmic space.



    #nt.linspace(0,10,3) // (0,5,10)
    #nt.logspace(1,3,3)
    #nt.geomspace(1,3,3)


===  Matrix



    #nt.matmul(m,m )              // matrix multiplication
    #nt.det(((1,3), (3,4)))       // only 2x2 supported for now
    #nt.trace(((1,3), (3,4)))     // trace of square matrix
    #nt.transpose(((1,3), (3,4))) // matrix transposition


===  Printing

Numty supports $ printing to the pdf of numerical matrices, both long and
short format.



    #nt.print((1,2),(4,2)))  // to display in the pdf
    #nt.p((1,2),(4,2)), " random string ")     // to display in the pdf


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` numty `



    #import "@preview/numty:0.0.5"

Time to kill? Search for words in a box of letters!

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=cereal-words&version=0.1.0)

Oh no, the Typst guys jumbled the letters! Bring order into this mess by
finding the hidden words.

This small game is playable in the Typst editor and best enjoyed with the web
app or ` typst watch ` . It was first released for the 24 Days to Christmas
campaign in winter of 2023.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` cereal-words ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/cereal-words


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` game ` function, which accepts a single positional
argument for the game input.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` game `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/cereal-words:0.1.0": game
    #show: game

    // Type the words here

3.2.0

For creating homebrew documents with the same fancy style as the Flying Circus
book? Provides simple commands to generate a whole aircraft stat page,
vehicle, or even ship.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=flyingcircus&version=3.2.0)

Version 3.2.0

Do you want your homebrew to have the same fancy style as the Flying Circus
book? Do you want a simple command to generate a whole aircraft stat page,
vehicle, or even ship? Iâll bet you do! Take a look at the Flying Circus
Aircraft Catalog Template.

==  Acknowledgments and Useful Links

Download the fonts from [ HERE ](https://github.com/Tetragramm/flying-circus-
typst-template/archive/refs/heads/Fonts.zip) . Install them on your computer,
upload them to the Typst web-app (anywhere in the project is fine) or use the
Typst command line option --font-path to include them.

Based on the style and work (with the permission of) Erika Chappell for the [
Flying Circus RPG ](https://opensketch.itch.io/flying-circus) .

Integrates with the [ Plane Builder
](https://tetragramm.github.io/PlaneBuilder/index.html) . Just click the
Catalog JSON button at the bottom to save what you need for this template.

Same with the [ Vehicle Builder
](https://tetragramm.github.io/VehicleBuilder/) .

Or check out the [ Discord server ](https://discord.gg/HKdyUuvmcb) .

==  Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on the
typst web app.



    #import "@preview/flyingcircus:3.2.0": *

    #show: FlyingCircus.with(
      Title: title,
      Author: author,
      CoverImg: image("images/cover.png"),
      Dedication: [It's Alive!!! MUAHAHAHA!],
    )

    #FCPlane(read("My Plane_stats.json"), Nickname:"My First Plane")


==  Usage

The first thing is the FlyingCircus style.



    #import "@preview/flyingcircus:3.2.0": *

    /// Defines the FlyingCircus template
    ///
    /// - Title (str): Title of the document. Goes in metadata and on title page.
    /// - Author (str): Author(s) of the document. Goes in metadata and on title page.
    /// - CoverImg (image): Image to make the first page of the document.
    /// - Description (str): Text to go with the title on the title page.
    /// - Dedication (str): Dedication to go down below the title on the title page.
    /// - body (content)
    /// -> content

    // Example
    #show: FlyingCircus.with(
      Title: title,
      Author: author,
      CoverImg: image("images/cover.png"),
      Dedication: [It's Alive!!! MUAHAHAHA!],
    )


Next is the FCPlane function for making plane pages.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Plane page.  Always on a new page. Image optional.
    ///
    /// - Plane (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the plane stats.
    /// - Nickname (str): Nickname to go under the aircraft name.
    /// - Img (image | none): Image to go at the top of the page. Set to none to remove.
    /// - BoxText (dictionary): Pairs of values to go in the box over the image. Does nothing if no Img provided.
    /// - BoxAnchor (str): Which anchor of the image to put the box in?  Sample values are "north", "south-west", "center".
    /// - DescriptiveText (content)
    /// -> content


    // Example
    #FCPlane(
      read("Basic Biplane_stats.json"),
      Nickname: "Bring home the bacon!",
      Img: image("images/Bergziegel_image.png"),
      BoxText: ("Role": "Fast Bomber", "First Flight": "1601", "Strengths": "Fastest Bomber"),
      BoxAnchor: "north-east",
    )[
    #lorem(100)
    ]


The FCVehicleSimple is for when you want to put multiple vehicles on a page.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Simple Vehicle.  Not always a full page. Image optional.
    ///
    /// - Vehicle (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the Vehicle stats.
    /// - Img (image): Image to go above the vehicle. (optional)
    /// - DescriptiveText (content)
    /// -> content
    #FCVehicleSimple(read("Sample Vehicle_stats.json"))[#lorem(120)]


FCVehicleFancy is a one or two page vehicle that looks nicer but takes up more
space.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Vehicle page.  Always on a new page. Image optional.
    /// If the Img is provided, it will take up two facing pages, otherwise only one, but a full page, unlike the Simple.
    ///
    /// - Vehicle (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the Vehicle stats.
    /// - Img (image | none): Image to go at the top of the first page. Set to none to remove.
    /// - TextVOffset (length): How far to push the text down the page. Want to do that inset text thing the book does? You can, the text can overlap with thte image.  Does nothing if no Img provided.
    /// - BoxText (dictionary): Pairs of values to go in the box over the image. Does nothing if no Img provided.
    /// - BoxAnchor (str): Which anchor of the image to put the box in?  Sample values are "north", "south-west", "center".
    /// - FirstPageContent (content): Goes on the first page. If no image is provided, it is not present.
    /// - AfterContent (content): Goes after the stat block. Always present.
    /// -> content

    // Example
    #FCVehicleFancy(
      read("Sample Vehicle_stats.json"),
      Img: image("images/Wandelburg.png"),
      TextVOffset: 6.2in,
      BoxText: ("Role": "Fast Bomber", "First Flight": "1601", "Strengths": "Fastest Bomber"),
      BoxAnchor: "north-east",
    )[
    #lorem(100)
    ][
    #lorem(100)
    ]


Last of the vehicles, FCShip is for boats like Into the Drink.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Ship page.  Always on a new page. Image optional.

    #figure(
      placement: auto,
      caption: [a caption],
      rect()
    )

    #lorem(30)


==  Usage

Check out [ the manual
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/gridlock/0.2.0/docs/gridlock-
manual.pdf) for a detailed description.

To get started, import the package into your document:



    #import "@preview/gridlock:0.2.0": *


Set up the basic parameters:



    #show: gridlock.with(
      paper: "a4",
      margin: (y: 76.445pt),
      font-size: 11pt,
      line-height: 13pt
    )


You can now use the ` lock() ` function to align any block to the text grid.
Block quotes bulleted/numbered lists, and floating figures do _not_ need to be
wrapped in ` lock() ` . Their spacing is handled fully automatically.



    #lock[= Heading]

    #lorem(50)

    #lock(figure(
      rect(),
      caption: [An example figure aligned to the grid.]
    ))

    #lorem(50)

    #lock[$ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 $]

    #lorem(50)


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` gridlock `



    #import "@preview/gridlock:0.2.0"

=  natrix

0.1.0

Natural and consistent matrix for typst.

![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/natrix/0.1.0/natrix.svg)

` natrix.nat ` is a drop-in replacement for ` mat ` with some additional
features. ` nat ` ensures that each row in your matrix should have the similar
height, unless one of them becomes too tall.

At this moment, it is recommended to use ` nat ` only in display equations,
but not in inline equations. This is because ` nat ` looks a little bit off
when used in inline equations.

==  Documentation

===  ` nat `

Every thing is the same as ` mat ` in typst.

This package also provides ` bnat ` , ` Bnat ` , ` vnat ` , ` Vnat ` ,

===  How to add

=  bamdone-aiaa

0.1.1

An American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) template for
conferences.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=bamdone-aiaa&version=0.1.1)

This is a Typst template for a one-column paper from the proceedings of the
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. The paper is tightly
spaced, fits a lot of content and comes preconfigured for numeric citations
from BibLaTeX or Hayagriva files.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` bamdone-aiaa ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/bamdone-aiaa


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` aiaa ` function with the following named
arguments:

  - ` title ` : The paperâs title as content.
  - ` authors-and-affiliations ` : An array of author dictionaries and affiliation dictionaries. Author dictionaries must have a ` name ` key and can have the keys ` job ` , ` department ` , ` aiaa ` is optional. Affiliation dictionaries must have the keys ` institution ` , ` city ` , ` state ` , ` zip ` , and ` country ` .
  - ` abstract ` : The content of a brief summary of the paper or ` none ` . Appears at the top of the first column in boldface. Shall be ` content ` .
  - ` paper-size ` : Defaults to ` us-letter ` . Specify a [ paper size string ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-paper) to change the page format.
  - ` bibliography ` : The result of a call to the ` bibliography ` function or ` none ` . Specifying this will configure numeric, AIAA-style citations.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
paper.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` aiaa `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/bamdone-aiaa:0.1.0": aiaa

    #show: aiaa.with(
      title: [A typesetting system to untangle the scientific writing process],

        These instructions give you guidelines for preparing papers for AIAA Technical Papers. Use this document as a template if you are using Typst. Otherwise, use this document as an instruction set. Define all symbols used in the abstract. Do not cite references in the abstract.

Parse, normalize and show publication frontmatter, including authors and
affiliations

_Beautiful scientific documents with structured metadata for publishers_

Pubmatter is a typst library for parsing, normalizing and showing scientific
publication frontmatter.

Utilities for loading, normalizing and working with authors, affiliations,
abstracts, keywords and other frontmatter information common in scientific
publications. Our goal is to introduce standardized ways of working with this
content to expose metadata to scientific publishers who are interested in
using typst in a standardized way. The specification for this ` pubmatter ` is
based on [ MyST Markdown ](https://mystmd.org/) and [ Quarto
](https://quarto.org/) , and can load their YAML files directly.

Pubmatter was used to create these documents, for loading the authors in a
standardized way and creting the common elements (authors, affiliations,
ORCIDs, DOIs, Open Access Links, copyright statements, etc.)

==  Documentation

The full documentation can be found in [ docs.pdf
](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/docs.pdf) . To use `
pubmatter ` import it:



    #import "@preview/pubmatter:0.1.0"


The docs also use ` pubmatter ` , in a simplified way, you can see the [
docs.typ ](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/docs.typ) to see a
simple example of using various components to create a new document. Here is a
preview of the docs:

](https://github.com/curvenote/pubmatter/blob/main/docs.pdf)

===  Loading Frontmatter

The frontmatter can contain all information for an article, including title,
authors, affiliations, abstracts and keywords. These are then normalized into
a standardized format that can be used with a number of ` show ` functions
like ` show-authors ` . For example, we might have a YAML file that looks like
this:



    author: Rowan Cockett
    date: 2024/01/26


You can load that file with ` yaml ` , and pass it to the ` load ` function:



    #let fm = pubmatter.load(yaml("pubmatter.yml"))


This will give you a normalized data-structure that can be used with the `
show ` functions for showing various parts of a document.

You can also use a ` dictionary ` directly:



    #let fm = pubmatter.load((
      author: (
        (
          name: "Rowan Cockett",
          email: "rowan@curvenote.com",
          orcid: "0000-0002-7859-8394",
          affiliations: "Curvenote Inc.",
        ),
      ),
      date: datetime(year: 2024, month: 01, day: 26),
      doi: "10.1190/tle35080703.1",
    ))
    #pubmatter.show-author-block(fm)


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curvenote/pubmatter/main/images/author-
block.png?raw=true)

===  Theming

The theme including color and font choice can be set using the ` THEME `
state. For example, this document has the following theme set:



    #let theme = (color: red.darken(20%), font: "Noto Sans")
    #set page(header: pubmatter.show-page-header(theme: theme, fm), footer: pubmatter.show-page-footer(fm))
    #state("THEME").update(theme)


Note that for the ` header ` the theme must be passed in directly. This will
hopefully become easier in the future, however, there is a current bug that
removes the page header/footer if you set this above the ` set page ` . See [
https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2987
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/pubmatter/0.1.0/#2987)
.

The ` font ` option only corresponds to the frontmatter content (abstracts,
title, header/footer etc.) allowing the body of your document to have a
different font choice.

===  Normalized Frontmatter Object

The frontmatter object has the following normalized structure:



    title: content
    subtitle: content
    short-title: string # alias: running-title, running-head
    # Authors Array
    # simple string provided for author is turned into ((name: string),)
    authors: # alias: author
      - name: string
        url: string # alias: website, homepage
        email: string
        phone: string
        fax: string
        orcid: string # alias: ORCID
        note: string
        corresponding: boolean # default: `true` when email set
        equal-contributor: boolean # alias: equalContributor, equal_contributor
        deceased: boolean
        roles: string[] # must be a contributor role
        affiliations: # alias: affiliation
          - id: string
            index: number
    # Affiliations Array
    affiliations: # alias: affiliation
      - string # simple string is turned into (name: string)
      - id: string
        index: number
        name: string
        institution: string # use either name or institution
    # Other publication metadata
    open-access: boolean
    license: # Can be set with a SPDX ID for creative commons
      id: string
      url: string
      name: string
    doi: string # must be only the ID, not the full URL
    date: datetime # validates from 'YYYY-MM-DD' if a string
    citation: content
    # Abstracts Array
    # content is turned into ((title: "Abstract", content: string),)
    abstracts: # alias: abstract
      - title: content
        content: content


Note that you will usually write the affiliations directly in line, in the
following example, we can see that the output is a normalized affiliation
object that is linked by the ` id ` of the affiliation (just the name if it is
a string!).



    #let fm = pubmatter.load((
      authors: (
        (
          name: "Rowan Cockett",
          affiliations: "Curvenote Inc.",
        ),
        (
          name: "Steve Purves",
          affiliations: ("Executable Books", "Curvenote Inc."),
        ),
      ),
    ))
    #raw(lang:"yaml", yaml.encode(fm))

=  icicle

0.1.0

Help the Typst Guys reach the helicopter pad and save Christmas!

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=icicle&version=0.1.0)

Help the Typst Guys reach the helicopter pad and save Christmas! Navigate them
with the WASD keys and solve puzzles with snowballs to make way for the Typst
Guys.

This small Christmas-themed game is playable in the Typst editor and best
enjoyed with the web app or ` typst watch ` . It was first released for the 24
Days to Christmas campaign in winter of 2023.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` icicle ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/icicle


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` game ` function, which accepts a positional
argument for the game input.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` game `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/icicle:0.1.0": game
    #show: game

    // Move with WASD.


You can also add your own levels by adding an array of level definition
strings in the ` game ` functionâs named ` levels ` argument. Each level
file must conform to the following format:

  - First, a line with two comma separated integers indicating the playerâs starting position.
  - Then, a matrix with the characters f (floor), x (wall), w (water), or g (goal).
  - Finally, a matrix with the characters b (snowball) or _ (nothing).

The three arguments must be separated by double newlines. Additionally, each
row in the matrices space-separates its values. Newlines terminate the rows.
Comments can be added with a double slash. Find an example for a valid level
string below:



    // The starting position
    0, 0

    // The back layer
    f f f w f f f
    f f f w f f f
    f f x w f f f
    f f f w f f f
    f f f w f x x
    x x x g x x x

    // The front layer.
    _ _ b _ _ _ _
    _ _ b _ _ _ _
    _ _ _ _ b _ _
    _ _ _ _ b _ _
    _ _ _ _ _ _ _
    _ _ _ _ _ _ _


Itâs best to put levels into separate files and load them with the ` read `
function.

= *unify.md*

=  unify

0.7.0

Format numbers, units, and ranges correctly.

Featured  Package

` unify ` is a [ Typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) package simplifying
the typesetting of numbers, units, and ranges. It is the equivalent to
LaTeXâs ` siunitx ` , though not as mature.

==  Overview

` unify ` allows flexible numbers and units, and still mostly gets well
typeset results.



    #import "@preview/unify:0.7.0": num,qty,numrange,qtyrange

    $ num("-1.32865+-0.50273e-6") $
    $ qty("1.3+1.2-0.3e3", "erg/cm^2/s", space: "#h(2mm)") $
    $ numrange("1,1238e-2", "3,0868e5", thousandsep: "'") $
    $ qtyrange("1e3", "2e3", "meter per second squared", per: "/", delimiter: "\"to\"") $


![](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/unify/0.7.0/examples/overview.jpg)

Right now, physical, monetary, and binary units are supported. New issues or
pull requests for new units are welcome!

==  Multilingual support

The Unify package supports multiple languages. Currently, the supported
languages are English and Russian. The fallback is English. If you want to add
your language, you should add two files: ` prefixes-xx.csv ` and ` units-
xx.csv ` , and in the ` lib.typ ` file you should fix the ` lang-db ` state
for your files.

==  ` num `

` num ` uses string parsing in order to typeset numbers, including separators
between the thousands. They can have the following form:

  - ` float ` or ` integer ` number
  - either ( ` {} ` stands for a number)
    - symmetric uncertainties with ` +-{} `
    - asymmetric uncertainties with ` +{}-{} `
  - exponential notation ` e{} `

Parentheses are automatically set as necessary. Use ` thousandsep ` to change
the separator between the thousands, and ` multiplier ` to change the
multiplication symbol between the number and exponential.

==  ` unit `

` unit ` takes the unit in words or in symbolic notation as its first
argument. The value of ` space ` will be inserted between units if necessary.
Setting ` per ` to ` symbol ` will format the number with exponents (i.e. `
^(-1) ` ), ` fraction ` or ` / ` using fraction, and ` fraction-short ` or `
\\/ ` using in-line fractions.
Units in words have four possible parts:

  - ` per ` forms the inverse of the following unit.
  - A written-out prefix in the sense of SI (e.g. ` centi ` ). This is added before the unit.
  - The unit itself written out (e.g. ` gram ` ).
  - A postfix like ` squared ` . This is added after the unit and takes ` per ` into account.

The shorthand notation also has four parts:

  - ` / ` forms the inverse of the following unit.
  - A short prefix in the sense of SI (e.g. ` k ` ). This is added before the unit.
  - The short unit itself (e.g. ` g ` ).
  - An exponent like ` ^2 ` . This is added after the unit and takes ` / ` into account.

Note: Use ` u ` for micro.

The possible values of the three latter parts are loaded at runtime from `
prefixes.csv ` , ` units.csv ` , and ` postfixes.csv ` (in the library
directory). Your own units etc. can be permanently added in these files. At
runtime, they can be added using ` add-unit ` and ` add-prefix ` ,
respectively. The formats for the pre- and postfixes are:

pre-/postfix  |  shorthand  |  symbol
---|---|---
milli  |  m  |  upright(âmâ)

and for units:

unit  |  shorthand  |  symbol  |  space
---|---|---|---
meter  |  m  |  upright(âmâ)  |  true

The first column specifies the written-out word, the second one the shorthand.
These should be unique. The third column represents the string that will be
inserted as the unit symbol. For units, the last column describes whether
there should be space before the unit (possible values: ` true ` / ` false ` ,
` 1 ` , ` 0 ` ). This is mostly the cases for degrees and other angle units
(e.g. arcseconds).
If you think there are units not included that are of interest for other
users, you can create an issue or PR.

==  ` qty `

` qty ` allows a ` num ` as the first argument following the same rules. The
second argument is a unit. If ` rawunit ` is set to true, its value will be
passed on to the result (note that the string passed on will be passed to `
eval ` , so add escaped quotes ` \" ` if necessary). Otherwise, it follows the
rules of ` unit ` . The value of ` space ` will be inserted between units if
necessary, ` thousandsep ` between the thousands, and ` per ` switches between
exponents and fractions.

==  ` numrange `

` numrange ` takes two ` num ` s as the first two arguments. If they have the
same exponent, it is automatically factorized. The range symbol can be changed
with ` delimiter ` , and the space between the numbers and symbols with `
space ` .

==  ` qtyrange `

` qtyrange ` is just a combination of ` unit ` and ` range ` .

This will copy over all required fonts and comes prefilled with the standard
template so you can see how it works. To use this you need to either install
all the fonts locally or pass the folder into --font-path when compiling.

To initialise the style, do:



    #import "@preview/wenyuan-campaign:0.1.0": *

    #show: conf.with()


Very easy.

Optionally, you may set all the theme fonts from the configure function (the
defaults are shown):



    #import "@preview/wenyuan-campaign:0.1.0": *

    #show: conf.with(
        fontsize: 10pt,
        mainFont: ("TeX Gyre Bonum", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        titleFont: ("TeX Gyre Bonum", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        sansFont: ("Scaly Sans Remake", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        sansSmallcapsFont: ("Scaly Sans Caps", "KingHwa_OldSong"),
        dropcapFont: "Royal Initialen"
    )

This shouldnât affect homebrew created using these fonts (just like how a painting made with a CC-BY-SA art program isnât itself CC-BY-SA) but what do I know Iâm not a lawyer.* _
  - [ KingHwa_OldSong ](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/637491623) (äº¬è¯èå®ä½) is a traditional Chinese print font used for all CJK text (if present, mostly because I need it)

0.1.0

Wrap content in custom functions with just indentation

` wrap-indent ` is a package for wrapping content in custom functions with
just indentation. This lets you avoid using trailing square brackets to wrap
content, instead you just indent it!

This system works by re-purposing Typstâs existing [ term-list
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/terms/) syntax via a custom show rule
on ` terms.item ` . We give it our custom function within [ state
](https://typst.app/docs/reference/introspection/state/) via a new ` wrap-in()
` function.

==  Hereâs a minimal example!

![A minimal
example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/wrap-
indent/0.1.0/example_page1.png)



    #set page(height: auto, width: 3.5in, margin: 0.25in)

    #import "@preview/wrap-indent:0.1.0": wrap-in, allow-wrapping

    #show terms.item: allow-wrapping

    / First --:
      A normal term list

      with multiple paragraphs

    But this text is separated


    #line(length: 100%)


    #let custom-block(content) = rect(content,
      fill: orange.lighten(90%),
      stroke: 1.5pt + gradient.linear(..color.map.flare)
    )

    / #wrap-in(custom-block):
      A _custom block_ using the `wrap-in` function

      with indented text \
      over multiple lines

    And this text is _still_ separated!


And in its own code block, hereâs the required initialization:



    #import "@preview/wrap-indent:0.1.0": wrap-in, allow-wrapping

    #show terms.item: allow-wrapping


==  And hereâs a more complicated example!

![A more complicated
example](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/wrap-
indent/0.1.0/example_page2.png)



    #set page(height: auto, width: 4.1in, margin: 0.25in)

    #show heading: set text(size: 0.75em)
    #show heading: set block(below: 1em)
    #set heading(numbering: "1) ")

    = Normal function call:

    // A function for wrapping some text:
    #let custom-quote(body) = rect(
    #let custom-quote(body) = rect(
      body,
      width: 100%,
      fill: luma(95%),
      stroke: (left: 2pt + luma(30%))
    )

    #custom-quote[
      Some text in a _custom quote_ spread over multiple lines
      so it actually looks like it was typed in a document.
    ]
    This text is outside the quote box


    = Wrappped function call!

    / #wrap-in(custom-quote):
      Some text in a _custom quote_ spread over multiple lines
      so it actually looks like it was typed in a document.

    This text is _still_ outside the quote box!


    = Arbitrary functions should _just work#emoji.tm;_

    / #wrap-in(x => ellipse(align(center, x),
        stroke: 3pt + gradient.conic(..color.map.rainbow)
      )):
      Some text in a _rainbow ellipse_ spread
      over multiple lines so it actually looks
      like it was typed in a document.


    = One-liners look great!

    / #wrap-in(underline): Here's one line underlined


    = Let's do some math:

    #let named-thm(name) = (content) => {
      pad(left: 2em, par(hanging-indent: -2em)[
        *Theorem* (#name) #emph(content)
      ])
    }

    / #wrap-in(named-thm("Operational Soundness")):
      If $med tack e : tau$ and $e$ reduces to $e'$
      by zero or more steps and $"Irred"(e')$,
      then $e' in "Val"$ and $med tack e' : tau$.


    = In-line styling doesn't create blocks:

    / #wrap-in(highlight):
      This text is highlighted.
    This text isn't.

    Notice how there was _no_ paragraph break between the
    two sentences? This is a useful result that makes
    `wrap-indent` really flexible!

    (if you want separate blocks, use `block` in your function)


    = Does it work with nesting?

    / #wrap-in(custom-quote):
      Testing...
      / #wrap-in(align.with(center)):
        / #wrap-in(rect):
          / #wrap-in(emph):
            Signs point to yes!


    = Final thoughts

    / Note --:
      Regular term lists still work!

    / Disclaimer --:
      You may run into issues with other term list
      show rules conflicting with this rule. \
      (although set rules should be unaffected)

      If you run into issues, _let me know!_ I'd love to hear
      about it to make this package as robust as possible.


    = And

    #let big-statement(content) = {
      align(center, text(
        underline(stroke: 1.5pt, content),
        size: 32pt,
        weight: "bold",
        style: "italic",
        fill: eastern,
      ))
    }

    / #wrap-in(big-statement):
      That's a wrap!

0.2.0

A helper library for chaining lambda abstractions

A helper library for chaining lambda abstractions, imitating the ` |> ` or ` .
` operator in some functional languages.

The function ` compose ` is the ` pipe ` function in the mathematical order.
Functions suffixed with underscore have their arguments flipped.

==  Changelog

  - 0.2.0 Redesigned interface to work with typstâs ` with ` keyword.
  - 0.1.0 Initial release

==  Basic usage

It can help improve readability with nested applications to a content value,
or make the diff cleaner.



    #compose_((
      text.with(blue),
      emph,
      strong,
      underline,
      strike,
    ))[This is a very long content with a lot of words]
    // Is equivalent to
    #text(
      blue,
      emph(
        strong(
          underline(
            strike[This is a very long content with a lot of words]
          )
        )
      )
    )


You can use it for show rules just like the example above.



    #show link: compose_.with((
      text.with(fill: blue),
      emph,
      underline,
    ))
    // These two are equivalent
    #show link: text.with(fill: blue)
    #show link: emph
    #show link: underline


This can also be useful when you need to destructure lists, as it allows
creating binds that are scoped by each lambda expression.



    #let two_and_one = pipe(
      (1, 2),
      (
        ((a, b)) => (a, b, -1), // becomes a list of length three
        ((a, b, _)) => (b, a), // discard the third element and swap
      ),
    )


===  How to add

0.1.1

Anatomy of a Font. Visualise metrics.

_Anatomy of a Font_ . Visualise metrics.

Import the ` anatomy ` package:



    #import "@preview/anatomy:0.1.1": metrics


==  Display Metrics

` metrics(72pt, "EB Garamond", display: "Typewriter") ` will be rendered as
follows:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E8D08F/packages/main/packages/preview/anatomy/0.1.1/img/export-1.svg)

Additionally, a closure using ` metrics ` dictionary as parameter can be used
to layout additional elements below:



    #metrics(54pt, "ä¸é»æé«",
      display: "é»å³æå­æ©",
      use: metrics => table(
        columns: 2,
        ..metrics.pairs().flatten().map(x => [ #x ])
      )
    )


It will generate:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E8D08F/packages/main/packages/preview/anatomy/0.1.1/img/export-2.svg)

==  Remark on Hybrid Typesetting

To typeset CJK text, adopting fontâs ascender/descender as ` top-edge ` / `
bottom-edge ` makes more sense in some cases. As for most CJK fonts, the
difference between ascender and descender heights will be exact 1em.

Tested with ` metrics(54pt, "Hiragino Mincho ProN", "ãã¬ã¿ã¤ãç«¯æ«") `
:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E8D08F/packages/main/packages/preview/anatomy/0.1.1/img/export-3.svg)

Since Typst will use metrics of the font which has the largest advance height
amongst the list provided in ` set text(font: ( ... )) ` to set up top and
bottom edges of a line, leading might not work as expected in hybrid
typesetting. This issue can be solved by passing the document to `
metrics(use: metrics => { ... }) ` like this:



    #show: doc => metrics(font.size, font.main,
      // Retrieve the metrics of the CJK font
      use: metrics => {
        set text(
          font.size,
          font: ( font.latin, font.main ),
          features: ( "pkna", ),
          // Use CJK fontâs ascender/descender as top/bottom edges
          top-edge: metrics.ascender,
          bottom-edge: metrics.descender,
          // ...
        )

        doc
      }
    )

= *idwtet.md*

=  idwtet

0.3.0

Package for uniform, correct and simplified typst code demonstration.

The name ` idwtet ` stands for âI Donât Wanna Type Everything Twiceâ. It
provides a ` typst-ex ` and a ` typst-ex-code ` codeblock, which _shows*and*
executes _ typst code.

It is meant for code demonstration, e.g. when publishing a package, and
provides some niceties:

  - the code should always be correct in the examples: As the example code is used for the code block, but also for evaluation, there is no need to write it twice
  - easy configuration with simple, uniform and good look

However, there are some limitations:

  - Every code block has its own local scope and the default behaviour is that variables are not reachable from outside. A similar restriction lies on import statements. That is why, there is the ` eval-scope ` argument, which captures variables and simulates global variables. Additionally, a ` typst ` codeblock is provided for a consistent look.
  - Locality can be displayed to the users by automatically wrapping code in ` typst-ex-code ` , but ` typst-ex ` does not provide such functionality. It might thus be difficult for users to understand code examples this way.
  - The page width has to be defined in absolute terms. It is quite nice, for a showcase, to take the least possible space, but tracking the widths of all boxes and then setting the page width accordingly is not (yet) possible.

==  Usage

Only one function is defined, ` init(body, bcolor: luma(210), inset: 5pt,
border: 2pt, radius: 2pt, content-font: "linux libertine", code-font-size:
9pt, content-font-size: 11pt, code-return-box: true, wrap-code: false, eval-
scope: (:), escape-bracket: "%") ` , which is supposed to be used with a show
rule.

Then raw codeblocks (with ` block=true ` ) of the languages ` typst ` , `
typst-ex ` , ` typst-code ` and ` typst-ex-code ` are modified. The main
feature of this package are ` typst-ex ` and ` typst-ex-code ` . The ` typst `
and ` typst-code ` blocks do not evaluate anything, but their design fits that
of the others.

The parameters of ` init ` are:

  - ` body ` : for usage with show rule, hence the whole document.
  - ` bcolor ` : the background- (and border-) color of the blocks
  - ` inset ` : inset param of code and content blocks, should be â¥ 2pt
  - ` border ` : border thickness
  - ` radius ` : block radius
  - ` content-font ` : The font used in the previewed content / result.
  - ` code-font-size ` : The fontsize used in the code blocks.
  - ` content-font-size ` : The fontsize used in the preview content / result.
  - ` code-return-box ` : If to show the code return type on ` typst-ex-code ` blocks.
  - ` wrap-code ` : If to wrap the code in ` #{ ` and ` } ` , to symbolize local scope.
  - ` eval-scope ` : A dictionary with the keys as the variable names and the values as another dictionary with keys ` value ` and ` code ` , both of these are optional. The former has the defined value, the latter the code recreate the variable, for usage in the code blocks.
  - ` escape-bracket ` : The text to wrap a variable with, to access the ` code ` part of a ` eval-scope ` variable.

==  Hiding code and replacements

There are currently two methods to change the code:

  - use the ` eval-scope ` argument from the ` init ` function. There is a ` code ` field in the dictionaries, which enables the usage of the key escaped in ` escape-bracket ` to be replaced in the codeblock code half and to be removed in the codeblock result half, as the value is given via scope. Take a look at the example below, where ` %ouset% ` is used this way.
  - use the ` ENDHIDDEN ` feature. When escaped in ` escape-bracket ` , everything above the statement is removed from the codeblock code half BUT everything (without the ` ENDHIDDEN ` statement) is evaluated. Take a look at the example in the examples folder.

==  Example



    #set page(margin: 0.5cm, width: 14cm, height: auto)
    #import "@preview/idwtet:0.1.0"
    #show: idwtet.init.with(eval-scope: (
      ouset: (
        value: {import "@preview/ouset:0.1.1": ouset; ouset},
        code: "#import \"@preview/ouset:0.1.1\": ouset"
      )
    ))

    == ouset package #text(gray)[(v0.1.1)]
    ```typst-ex
    %ouset%
    $
    "Expression 1" ouset(&, <==>, "Theorem 1") "Expression 2"\
                   ouset(&, ==>,, "Theorem 7") "Expression 3"
    $
    ```
    Or something like
    ```typst-ex-code
    let a = range(10)
    a
    ```


Further examples are given in the repo example folder.

= *down.md*

=  down

0.1.0

Pass down arguments of `sum`, `integral`, etc. to the next line, which can
generate shorthand to present reusable segments.

Pass down arguments of ` sum ` , ` integral ` , etc. to the next line, which
can generate shorthand to present reusable segments. While writing long step-
by-step equations, only certain parts of a line change. ` down ` leverages
Typstâs ` context ` (from version 0.11.0) to help relieve the pressure of
writing long and repetitive formulae.

Import the package:



    #import "@preview/down:0.1.0": *


==  Usage

Create new contexts by using camel-case commands, such as ` Limit(x, +0) ` .
Retrieve the contextual with ` cLimit ` .

  - ` Limit(x, c) ` and ` cLimit ` :



    $
    Lim(x, +0) x ln(sin x)
      = cLim ln(sin x) / x^(-1)
      = cLim x / (sin x) cos x
      = 0
    $


  - ` Sum(index, lower, upper) ` and ` cSum ` :



    $
    Sum(n, 0, oo) 1 / sqrt(n + 1)
      = Sum(#none, 0, #none) 1 / sqrt(n)
      = cSum 1 / n^(1 / 2)
    $


  - ` Integral(lower, upper, f, dif: [x]) ` , ` cIntegral(f) ` and ` cIntegrated(f) ` :



    $
    Integral(0, pi / 3, sqrt(1 + tan^2 x))
      = cIntegral(1 / (cos x))
      = cIntegrated(ln (cos x / 2 + sin x / 2) / (cos x / 2 - sin x / 2))
      = ln (2 + sqrt(3))
    $

*Quill* is a package for creating quantum circuit diagrams in [ Typst
](https://typst.app/) .

_Note, that this package is in beta and may still be undergoing breaking
changes. As new features like data types and scoped functions will be added to
Typst, this package will be adapted to profit from the new paradigms._

==  Basic usage

The function ` quantum-circuit() ` takes any number of positional gates and
works somewhat similarly to the built-int Typst functions ` table() ` or `
grid() ` . A variety of different gate and instruction commands are available
for adding elements and integers can be used to produce any number of empty
cells (filled with the current wire style). A new wire is started by adding a
` [\ ] ` item.



    #{
      import "@preview/quill:0.5.0": *

      quantum-circuit(
        lstick($|0âª$), $H$, ctrl(1), rstick($(|00âª+|11âª)/â2$, n: 2), [\ ],
        lstick($|0âª$), 1, targ(), 1
      )
    }


![Bell circuit](https://github.com/user-
attachments/assets/53d0c581-ab62-44e3-abf5-5497993d7aba)

Plain quantum gates â such as a Hadamard gate â can be written with the
shorthand notation ` $H$ ` instead of the more lengthy ` gate($H$) ` . The
latter offers more options, however.

Refer to the [ user guide ](https://github.com/Mc-
Zen/quill/releases/download/v0.5.0/quill-guide.pdf) for a full documentation
of this package. You can also look up the documentation of any function by
calling the help module, e.g., ` help("gate") ` in order to print the
signature and description of the ` gate ` command, just where you are
currently typing (powered by [ tidy ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/tidy) ).

==  Cheat Sheet

Instead of listing every featured gate (as is done in the [ user guide
](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/quill/releases/download/v0.5.0/quill-guide.pdf) ),
this gallery quickly showcases a large selection of possible gates and
decorations that can be added to any quantum circuit.

==  Tequila

_Tequila_ is a submodule that adds a completely different way of building
circuits.



    #import "@preview/quill:0.5.0" as quill: tequila as tq

    #quill.quantum-circuit(
      ..tq.build(
        tq.h(0),
        tq.cx(0, 1),
        tq.cx(0, 2),
      ),
      quill.gategroup(x: 2, y: 0, 3, 2)
    )


This is similar to how _QASM_ and _Qiskit_ work: gates are successively
applied to the circuit which is then layed out automatically by packing gates
as tightly as possible. We start by calling the ` tq.build() ` function and
filling it with quantum operations. This returns a collection of gates which
we expand into the circuit with the ` .. ` syntax. Now, we still have the
option to add annotations, groups, slices, or even more gates via manual
placement.

The syntax works analog to Qiskit. Available gates are ` x ` , ` y ` , ` z ` ,
` h ` , ` s ` , ` sdg ` , ` sx ` , ` sxdg ` , ` t ` , ` tdg ` , ` p ` , ` rx `
, ` ry ` , ` rz ` , ` u ` , ` cx ` , ` cz ` , and ` swap ` . With ` barrier `
, an invisible barrier can be inserted to prevent gates on different qubits to
be packed tightly. Finally, with ` tq.gate ` and ` tq.mqgate ` , a generic
gate can be created. These two accept the same styling arguments as the normal
` gate ` (or ` mqgate ` ).

Also like Qiskit, all qubit arguments support ranges, e.g., ` tq.h(range(5)) `
adds a Hadamard gate on the first five qubits and ` tq.cx((0, 1), (1, 2)) `
adds two CX gates: one from qubit 0 to 1 and one from qubit 1 to 2.

With Tequila, it is easy to build templates for quantum circuits and to
compose circuits of various building blocks. For this purpose, ` tq.build() `
and the built-in templates all feature optional ` x ` and ` y ` arguments to
allow placing a subcircuit at an arbitrary position of the circuit. As an
example, Tequila provides a ` tq.graph-state() ` template for quickly drawing
graph state preparation circuits.

The following example demonstrates how to compose multiple subcircuits.



    #import tequila as tq

    #quantum-circuit(
      ..tq.graph-state((0, 1), (1, 2)),
      ..tq.build(y: 3,
          tq.p($pi$, 0),
          tq.cx(0, (1, 2)),
        ),
      ..tq.graph-state(x: 6, y: 2, invert: true, (0, 1), (0, 2)),
      gategroup(x: 1, 3, 3),
      gategroup(x: 1, y: 3, 3, 3),
      gategroup(x: 6, y: 2, 3, 3),
      slice(x: 5)
    )

==  Tests

This package uses [ typst-test ](https://github.com/tingerrr/typst-test/) for
running [ tests ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/quill/tree/v0.5.0/tests/) .

==  Changelog

===  v0.5.0

  - Added support for multi-controlled gates with Tequila.
  - Switched to using ` context ` instead of the now deprecated ` style() ` for measurement. Note: Starting with this version, Typst 0.11.0 or higher is required.

===  v0.4.0

  - Alternative model for creating and composing circuits: [ Tequila ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/quill/0.5.0/#tequila) .

===  v0.3.0

  - New features
    - Enable manual placement of gates, ` gate($X$, x: 3, y: 1) ` , similar to built-in ` table() ` in addition to automatic placement. This works for most elements, not only gates.
    - Add parameter ` pad ` to ` lstick() ` and ` rstick() ` .
    - Add parameter ` fill-wires ` to ` quantum-circuit() ` . All wires are filled unto the end (determined by the longest wire) by default (breaking change â ï¸). This behavior can be reverted by setting ` fill-wires: false ` .
    - ` gategroup() ` ` slice() ` and ` annotate() ` can now be placed above or below the circuit with ` z: "above" ` and ` z: "below" ` .
    - ` help() ` command for quickly displaying the documentation of a given function, e.g., ` help("gate") ` . Powered by [ tidy ](https://github.com/Mc-Zen/tidy) .
  - Improvements:
    - Complete rework of circuit layout implementation
      - allows transparent gates since wires are not drawn through gates anymore. The default fill is now ` auto ` and using ` none ` sets the background to transparent.
      - ` midstick ` is now transparent by default.
    - ` setwire() ` can now be used to override only partial wire settings, such as wire color ` setwire(1, stroke: blue) ` , width ` setwire(1, stroke: 1pt) ` or wire distance, all separately. Before, some settings were reset.
  - Fixes:
    - Fixed ` lstick ` / ` rstick ` when equation numbering is turned on.
  - Removed:
    - The already deprecated ` scale-factor ` (use ` scale ` instead)

===  v0.2.1

  - Improvements:
    - Add ` fill ` parameter to ` midstick() ` .
    - Add ` bend ` parameter to ` permute() ` .
    - Add ` separation ` parameter to ` permute() ` .
  - Fixes:
    - With Typst 0.11.0, ` scale() ` now takes into account outer alignment. This broke the positioning of centered/right-aligned circuits, e.g., ones put into a ` figure() ` .
    - Change wires to be drawn all through ` ctrl() ` , making it consistent to ` swap() ` and ` targ() ` .

===  v0.2.0

  - New features:
    - Add arbitrary labels to any ` gate ` (also derived gates such as ` meter ` , ` ctrl ` , â¦), ` gategroup ` or ` slice ` that can be anchored to any of the nine 2d alignments.
    - Add optional gate inputs and outputs for multi-qubit gates (see gallery).
    - Implicit gates (breaking change â ï¸): a content item automatically becomes a gate, so you can just type ` $H$ ` instead of ` gate($H$) ` (of course, the ` gate() ` function is still important in order to use the many available options).
  - Other breaking changes â ï¸:
    - ` slice() ` has no ` dx ` and ` dy ` parameters anymore. Instead, labels are handled through ` label ` exactly as in ` gate() ` . Also the ` wires ` parameter is replaced with ` n ` for consistency with other multi-qubit gates.
    - Swap order of row and column parameters in ` annotate() ` to make it consistent with built-in Typst functions.
  - Improvements:
    - Improve layout (allow row/column spacing and min lengths to be specified in em-lengths).
    - Automatic bounds computation, even for labels.
    - Improve meter (allow multi-qubit gate meters and respect global (per-circuit) gate padding).d
  - Fixes:
    - ` lstick ` / ` rstick ` braces broke with Typst 0.7.0.
    - ` lstick ` / ` rstick ` bounds.
  - Documentation
    - Add section on creating custom gates.
    - Add section on using labels.
    - Explain usage of ` slice() ` and ` gategroup() ` .

= *lasaveur.md*

=  lasaveur

0.1.3

Porting vim-latex's math shorthands to Typst. An accommendating vim syntax
file is provided in the repo.

This is a Typst package for speedy mathematical input, inspired by [ vim-latex
](https://github.com/vim-latex/vim-latex) . This project is named after my Vim
plugin [ vimtex-lasaveur ](https://github.com/yangwenbo99/vimtex-lasaveur) ,
which ports the operations in vim-latex to [ vimtex
](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) .

==  Usages in Typst

Either use the file released in âReleasesâ or import using the following
command:



    #import "@preview/lasaveur:0.1.3": *


This script generates a Typst library that defines shorthand commands for
various mathematical symbols and functions. Hereâs an overview of what it
provides and how a user can use it:

  1. Mathematical Functions:
     - Usage: ` f<key>(argument) `
     - Examples: ` fh(x) ` for hat, ` ft(x) ` for tilde, ` f2(x) ` for square root
  2. Font Styles:
     - Usage: ` f<key>(argument) `
     - Examples: ` fb(x) ` for bold, ` fbb(x) ` for blackboard bold, ` fca(x) ` for calligraphic
  3. Greek Letters:
     - Usage: ` k<key> `
     - Examples: ` ka ` for Î± (alpha), ` kb ` for Î² (beta), ` kG ` for Î (capital Gamma)
  4. Common Mathematical Symbols:
     - Usage: ` g<key> `
     - Examples: ` g8 ` for â (infinity), ` gU ` for âª (union), ` gI ` for â© (intersection)
  5. LaTeX-compatible Symbols:
     - Usage: Direct LaTeX command names
     - Examples: ` partial ` for â, ` infty ` for â, ` cdot ` for â
  6. Arrows:
     - Usage: ` ar.<key> `
     - Examples: ` ar.l ` for â, ` ar.r ` for â, ` ar.lr ` for â

Users can employ these shorthands in their Typst documents to quickly input
mathematical symbols and functions. The exact prefix for each category (like `
f ` for functions or ` k ` for Greek letters) can be customized using command-
line arguments when running the script.

For instance, in a Typst document, after importing the generated library, a
user could write:



    $fh(x) + ka + g8 + ar.r$


This would produce: xÌ + Î± + â + â

The script provides a wide range of symbols covering most common mathematical
notations, making it easier and faster to type complex mathematical
expressions in Typst â especially for users migrating from vim-latex.

==  Accompanying Vim Syntax File

The syntax file provides more advanced and correct concealing for both
Typstâs built-in math syntax and the lasaveur shorthands. Download the
syntax file from the âReleasesâ section and place it in your `
~/.vim/after/syntax/ ` directory. The ` syntax.vim ` file in the repo is
supposed to be used by the generation script and it _will not work_ if
directly sourced in Vim.

=  starter-journal-article

0.3.1

A starter template for journal articles.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=starter-journal-article&version=0.3.1)

This package provides a template for writing journal articles to organise
authors, institutions, and information of corresponding authors.

==  Usage

Run the following command to use this template



    typst init @preview/starter-journal-article


==  Documentation

===  ` article `

The template for creating journal articles. It needs the following arguments.

Arguments:

  - ` title ` : The title of this article. Default: ` "Article Title" ` .
  - ` authors ` : A dictionary of authors. Dictionary keys are authorsâ names. Dictionary values are meta data of every author, including label(s) of affiliation(s), email, contact address, or a self-defined name (to avoid name conflicts). The label(s) of affiliation(s) must be those claimed in the argument ` affiliations ` . Once the email or address exists, the author(s) will be labelled as the corresponding author(s), and their address will show in footnotes. Function ` author-meta() ` is useful in creating information for each author. Default: ` ("Author Name": author-meta("affiliation-label")) ` .
  - ` affiliations ` : A dictionary of affiliation. Dictionary keys are affiliationsâ labels. These labels show be constent with those used in authorsâ meta data. Dictionary values are addresses of every affiliation. Default: ` ("affiliation-label": "Affiliation address") ` .
  - ` abstract ` : The paperâs abstract. Default: ` [] ` .
  - ` keywords ` : The paperâs keywords. Default: ` [] ` .
  - ` bib ` : The bibliography. Accept value from the built-in ` bibliography ` function. Default: ` none ` .
  - ` template ` : Templates for the following parts. Please see below for more informations
    - ` title: (title) => {} ` : how to show the title of this article.
    - ` author-info: (authors, affiliations) => {} ` : how to show each authorâs information.
    - ` abstract: (abstract, keywords) => {} ` : how to show the abstract and keywords.
    - ` bibliography: (bib) => {} ` : how to show the bibliography.
    - ` body: (body) => {} ` : how to show main text.

===  ` author-meta `

A helper to create meta information for an author.

Arguments:

  - ` ..affiliation ` : Capture the positioned arguments as label(s) of affiliation(s). Mandatory.
  - ` email ` : The email address of the author. Default: ` none ` .
  - ` alias ` : The display name of the author. Default: ` none ` .
  - ` address ` : The address of the author. Default: ` none ` .
  - ` cofirst ` : Whether the author is the co-first author. Default: ` false ` .

==  Default templates

The following code shows how the default templates are defined. You can
override any of the by setting the ` template ` argument in the ` article() `
function to customise the template.



    #let default-title(title) = {
      show: block.with(width: 100%)
      set align(center)
      set text(size: 1.75em, weight: "bold")
      title
    }

    #let default-author(author) = {
      text(author.name)
      super(author.insts.map(it => str(it)).join(","))
      if author.corresponding {
        footnote[
          Corresponding author. Address: #author.address.
          #if author.email != none {
            [Email: #underline(author.email).]
          }
        ]
      }
      if author.cofirst == "thefirst" {
        footnote("cofirst-author-mark")
      } else if author.cofirst == "cofirst" {
        locate(loc => query(footnote.where(body: [cofirst-author-mark]), loc).last())
      }
    }
          #if author.email != none {
            [Email: #underline(author.email).]
          }

template.](https://packages.typst.org/preview/thumbnails/mantys-0.1.4-small.webp)

=  mantys

0.1.4

Helpers to build manuals for Typst packages.

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=mantys&version=0.1.4)

> *MAN* uals for *TY* p *S* t

Template for documenting [ typst ](https://github.com/typst/typst) packages
and templates.

==  Usage

Just import the package at the beginning of your manual:



    #import "@preview/mantys:0.1.4": *


Mantys supports *Typst 0.11.0* and newer.

==  Writing basics

A basic template for a manual could look like this:



    #import "@local/mantys:0.1.4": *

    #import "your-package.typ"

    #show: mantys.with(
    	name:		"your-package-name",
    	title: 		[A title for the manual],
    	subtitle: 	[A subtitle for the manual],
    	info:		[A short descriptive text for the package.],
    	authors:	"Your Name",
    	url:		"https://github.com/repository/url",
    	version:	"0.0.1",
    	date:		"date-of-release",
    	abstract: 	[
    		A few paragraphs of text to describe the package.
    	],

    	example-imports: (your-package: your-package)
    )

    // end of preamble

    # About
    #lorem(50)

    # Usage
    #lorem(50)

    # Available commands
    #lorem(50)



Use ` #command(name, ..args)[description] ` to describe commands and `
#argument(name, ...)[description] ` for arguments:



    #command("headline", arg[color], arg(size:1.8em), sarg[other-args], barg[body])[
    	Renders a prominent headline using #doc("meta/heading").

    	#argument("color", type:"color")[
        The color of the headline will be used as the background of a #doc("layout/block") element containing the headline.
      ]
      #argument("size", default:1.8em)[
        The text size for the headline.
      ]
      #argument("sarg", is-sink:true)[
        Other options will get passed directly to #doc("meta/heading").
      ]
      #argument("body", type:"content")[
        The text for the headline.
      ]

      The headline is shown as a prominent colored block to highlight important news articles in the newsletter:

      #example[```
      #headline(blue, size: 2em, level: 3)[
        #lorem(8)
      ]
      ```]
    ]


The result might look something like this:

==  How to Compile

This project contains an example setup that splits individual chapters into
different files.
This can cause problems when using references etc.
These problems can be avoided by following these steps:

  - Make sure to always compile your ` main.typ ` file which includes all of your chapters for references to work correctly.
  - VSCode:
    - Install the [ Tinymist Typst ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extension.
    - Make sure to start the ` PDF ` or ` Live Preview ` only from within your ` main.typ ` file.
    - If problems occur it usually helps to close the preview and restart it from your ` main.typ ` file.

==  Examples

Examples can be found inside of the [ examples
](https://github.com/LasseRosenow/HAW-Hamburg-Typst-
Template/tree/main/examples) directory

  - For Bachelor theses see: [ Bachelor thesis example ](https://github.com/LasseRosenow/HAW-Hamburg-Typst-Template/tree/main/examples/bachelor-thesis)

==  Acronyms

This template provides functions to reference acronyms in the text. To use
these functions, you need to define the acronyms in the ` acronyms ` attribute
of the template. The acronyms referenced with the functions below will be
linked to their definition in the list of acronyms.

===  Functions

This template provides the following functions to reference acronyms:

` acr ` : Reference an acronym in the text (e.g. ` acr("API") ` -> `
Application Programming Interface (API) ` or ` API ` )

` acrpl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in plural form (e.g. `
acrpl("API") ` -> ` Application Programming Interfaces (API) ` or ` APIs ` )

` acrs ` : Reference an acronym in the text in short form (e.g. ` acrs("API")
` -> ` API ` )

` acrspl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in short form in plural form
(e.g. ` acrpl("API") ` -> ` APIs ` )

` acrl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in long form (e.g. ` acrl("API") `
-> ` Application Programming Interface ` )

` acrlpl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in long form in plural form
(e.g. ` acrlpl("API") ` -> ` Application Programming Interfaces ` )

` acrf ` : Reference an acronym in the text in full form (e.g. ` acrf("API") `
-> ` Application Programming Interface (API) ` )

` acrfpl ` : Reference an acronym in the text in full form in plural form
(e.g. ` acrfpl("API") ` -> ` Application Programming Interfaces (API) ` )

===  Definition

To define acronyms use a dictionary and pass it to the acronyms attribute of
the template. The dictionary should contain the acronyms as keys and their
long forms as values.



    #let acronyms = (
      API: "Application Programming Interface",
      HTTP: "Hypertext Transfer Protocol",
      REST: "Representational State Transfer",
    )


To define the plural form of an acronym use a array as value with the first
element being the singular form and the second element being the plural form.
If you donât define the plural form, the template will automatically add an
âsâ to the singular form.



    #let acronyms = (
      API: ("Application Programming Interface", "Application Programming Interfaces"),
      HTTP: ("Hypertext Transfer Protocol", "Hypertext Transfer Protocols"),
      REST: ("Representational State Transfer", "Representational State Transfers"),
    )


==  Glossary

Similar to the acronyms, this template provides a function to reference
glossary terms in the text. To use the function, you need to define the
glossary terms in the ` glossary ` attribute of the template. The glossary
terms referenced with the function below will be linked to their definition in
the list of glossary terms.

===  Reference

` gls ` : Reference a glossary term in the text (e.g. ` gls("Vulnerability") `
-> link to the definition of âVulnerabilityâ in the glossary)

===  Definition

The definition works analogously to the acronyms. Define the glossary terms in
a dictionary and pass it to the glossary attribute of the template. The
dictionary should contain the glossary terms as keys and their definitions as
values.



    #let glossary = (
      Vulnerability: "A Vulnerability is a flaw in a computer system that weakens the overall security of the system.",
      Patch: "A patch is data that is intended to be used to modify an existing software resource such as a program or a file, often to fix bugs and security vulnerabilities.",
      Exploit: "An exploit is a method or piece of code that takes advantage of vulnerabilities in software, applications, networks, operating systems, or hardware, typically for malicious purposes.",
    )

Convenient Rust-like string formatting in Typst

A Typst library that brings convenient string formatting and interpolation
through the ` strfmt ` function. Its syntax is taken directly from Rustâs `
format! ` syntax, so feel free to read its page for more information ( [
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/ ](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/) );
however, this README should have enough information and examples for all
expected uses of the library. Only a few things arenât supported from the
Rust syntax, such as the ` p ` (pointer) format type, or the ` .* ` precision
specifier.

A few extras (beyond the Rust-like syntax) will be added over time, though
(feel free to drop suggestions at the repository: [
https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-oxifmt ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-
oxifmt) ). The first âextraâ so far is the ` fmt-decimal-separator:
"string" ` parameter, which lets you customize the decimal separator for
decimal numbers (floats) inserted into strings. E.g. ` strfmt("Result: {}",
5.8, fmt-decimal-separator: ",") ` will return the string ` "Result: 5,8" `
(comma instead of dot). See more below.

==  Usage

You can use this library through Typstâs package manager (for Typst
v0.6.0+):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt


For older Typst versions, download the ` oxifmt.typ ` file either from
Releases or directly from the repository. Then, move it to your projectâs
folder, and write at the top of your Typst file(s):



    #import "oxifmt.typ": strfmt


Doing the above will give you access to the main function provided by this
library ( ` strfmt ` ), which accepts a format string, followed by zero or
more replacements to insert in that string (according to ` {...} ` formats
inserted in that string), an optional ` fmt-decimal-separator ` parameter, and
returns the formatted string, as described below.

Its syntax is almost identical to Rustâs ` format! ` (as specified here: [
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/ ](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/) ).
You can escape formats by duplicating braces ( ` {{ ` and ` }} ` become ` { `
and ` } ` ). Hereâs an example (see more examples in the file `
tests/strfmt-tests.typ ` ):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("I'm {}. I have {num} cars. I'm {0}. {} is {{cool}}.", "John", "Carl", num: 10)
    #assert.eq(s, "I'm John. I have 10 cars. I'm John. Carl is {cool}.")


Note that ` {} ` extracts positional arguments after the string sequentially
(the first ` {} ` extracts the first one, the second ` {} ` extracts the
second one, and so on), while ` {0} ` , ` {1} ` , etc. will always extract the
first, the second etc. positional arguments after the string. Additionally, `
{bananas} ` will extract the named argument âbananasâ.

===  Formatting options

You can use ` {:spec} ` to customize your output. See the Rust docs linked
above for more info, but a summary is below.

(You may also want to check out the examples at [ Examples
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oxifmt/0.2.1/#examples)
.)

  - Adding a ` ? ` at the end of ` spec ` (that is, writing e.g. ` {0:?} ` ) will call ` repr() ` to stringify your argument, instead of ` str() ` . Note that this only has an effect if your argument is a string, an integer, a float or a ` label() ` / ` <label> ` \- for all other types (such as booleans or elements), ` repr() ` is always called (as ` str() ` is unsupported for those).
    - For strings, ` ? ` (and thus ` repr() ` ) has the effect of printing them with double quotes. For floats, this ensures a ` .0 ` appears after it, even if it doesnât have decimal digits. For integers, this doesnât change anything. Finally, for labels, the ` <label> ` (with ` ? ` ) is printed as ` <label> ` instead of ` label ` .
    - *TIP:* Prefer to always use ` ? ` when youâre inserting something that isnât a string, number or label, in order to ensure consistent results even if the library eventually changes the non- ` ? ` representation.
  - After the ` : ` , add e.g. ` _<8 ` to align the string to the left, padding it with as many ` _ ` s as necessary for it to be at least ` 8 ` characters long (for example). Replace ` < ` by ` > ` for right alignment, or ` ^ ` for center alignment. (If the ` _ ` is omitted, it defaults to â â (aligns with spaces).)
    - If you prefer to specify the minimum width (the ` 8 ` there) as a separate argument to ` strfmt ` instead, you can specify ` argument$ ` in place of the width, which will extract it from the integer at ` argument ` . For example, ` _^3$ ` will center align the output with ` _ ` s, where the minimum width desired is specified by the fourth positional argument (index ` 3 ` ), as an integer. This means that a call such as ` strfmt("{:_^3$}", 1, 2, 3, 4) ` would produce ` "__1__" ` , as ` 3$ ` would evaluate to ` 4 ` (the value at the fourth positional argument/index ` 3 ` ). Similarly, ` named$ ` would take the width from the argument with name ` named ` , if it is an integer (otherwise, error).
  - *For numbers:*
    - Specify ` + ` after the ` : ` to ensure zero or positive numbers are prefixed with ` + ` before them (instead of having no sign). ` - ` is also accepted but ignored (negative numbers always specify their sign anyways).
    - Use something like ` :09 ` to add zeroes to the left of the number until it has at least 9 digits / characters.
      - The ` 9 ` here is also a width, so the same comment from before applies (you can add ` $ ` to take it from an argument to the ` strfmt ` function).
    - Use ` :.5 ` to ensure your float is represented with 5 decimal digits of precision (zeroes are added to the right if needed; otherwise, it is rounded, *not truncated* ).
      - Note that floating point inaccuracies can be sometimes observed here, which is an unfortunate current limitation.
      - Similarly to ` width ` , the precision can also be specified via an argument with the ` $ ` syntax: ` .5$ ` will take the precision from the integer at argument number 5 (the sixth one), while ` .test$ ` will take it from the argument named ` test ` .
    - *Integers only:* Add ` x ` (lowercase hex) or ` X ` (uppercase) at the end of the ` spec ` to convert the number to hexadecimal. Also, ` b ` will convert it to binary, while ` o ` will convert to octal.
      - Specify a hashtag, e.g. ` #x ` or ` #b ` , to prepend the corresponding base prefix to the base-converted number, e.g. ` 0xABC ` instead of ` ABC ` .
    - Add ` e ` or ` E ` at the end of the ` spec ` to ensure the number is represented in scientific notation (with ` e ` or ` E ` as the exponent separator, respectively).
    - For decimal numbers (floats), you can specify ` fmt-decimal-separator: "," ` to ` strfmt ` to have the decimal separator be a comma instead of a dot, for example.
      - To have this be the default, you can alias ` strfmt ` , such as using ` #let strfmt = strfmt.with(fmt-decimal-separator: ",") ` .
    - Number spec arguments (such as ` .5 ` ) are ignored when the argument is not a number, but e.g. a string, even if it looks like a number (such as ` "5" ` ).
  - Note that all spec arguments above *have to be specified in order* \- if you mix up the order, it wonât work properly!
    - Check the grammar below for the proper order, but, in summary: fill (character) with align ( ` < ` , ` > ` or ` ^ ` ) -> sign ( ` + ` or ` - ` ) -> ` # ` -> ` 0 ` (for 0 left-padding of numbers) -> width (e.g. ` 8 ` from ` 08 ` or ` 9 ` from ` -<9 ` ) -> ` .precision ` -> spec type ( ` ? ` , ` x ` , ` X ` , ` b ` , ` o ` , ` e ` , ` E ` )).

Some examples:



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s1 = strfmt("{0:?}, {test:+012e}, {1:-<#8x}", "hi", -74, test: 569.4)
    #assert.eq(s1, "\"hi\", +00005.694e2, -0x4a---")

    #let s2 = strfmt("{:_>+11.5}", 59.4)
    #assert.eq(s2, "__+59.40000")

    #let s3 = strfmt("Dict: {:!<10?}", (a: 5))
    #assert.eq(s3, "Dict: (a: 5)!!!!")


===  Examples

  - *Inserting labels, text and numbers into strings:*



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("First: {}, Second: {}, Fourth: {3}, Banana: {banana} (brackets: {{escaped}})", 1, 2.1, 3, label("four"), banana: "Banana!!")
    #assert.eq(s, "First: 1, Second: 2.1, Fourth: four, Banana: Banana!! (brackets: {escaped})")


  - *Forcing` repr() ` with ` {:?} ` * (which adds quotes around strings, and other things - basically represents a Typst value):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("The value is: {:?} | Also the label is {:?}", "something", label("label"))
    #assert.eq(s, "The value is: \"something\" | Also the label is <label>")


  - *Inserting other types than numbers and strings* (for now, they will always use ` repr() ` , even without ` {...:?} ` , although that is more explicit):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Values: {:?}, {1:?}, {stuff:?}", (test: 500), ("a", 5.1), stuff: [a])
    #assert.eq(s, "Values: (test: 500), (\"a\", 5.1), [a]")


  - *Padding to a certain width with characters:* Use ` {:x<8} ` , where ` x ` is the *character to pad with* (e.g. space or ` _ ` , but can be anything), ` < ` is the *alignment of the original text* relative to the padding (can be ` < ` for left aligned (padding goes to the right), ` > ` for right aligned (padded to its left) and ` ^ ` for center aligned (padded at both left and right)), and ` 8 ` is the *desired total width* (padding will add enough characters to reach this width; if the replacement string already has this width, no padding will be added):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Left5 {:-<5}, Right6 {:=>6}, Center10 {centered: ^10?}, Left3 {tleft:_<3}", "xx", 539, tleft: "okay", centered: [a])
    #assert.eq(s, "Left5 xx---, Right6 ===539, Center10     [a]    , Left3 okay")
    // note how 'okay' didn't suffer any padding at all (it already had at least the desired total width).


  - *Padding numbers with zeroes to the left:* Itâs a similar functionality to the above, however you write ` {:08} ` for 8 characters (for instance) - note that any characters in the numberâs representation matter for width (including sign, dot and decimal part):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Left-padded7 numbers: {:07} {:07} {:07} {3:07}", 123, -344, 44224059, 45.32)
    #assert.eq(s, "Left-padded7 numbers: 0000123 -000344 44224059 0045.32")


  - *Defining padding-to width using parameters, not literals:* If you want the desired replacement width (the ` 8 ` in ` {:08} ` or ` {: ^8} ` ) to be passed via parameter (instead of being hardcoded into the format string), you can specify ` parameter$ ` in place of the width, e.g. ` {:02$} ` to take it from the third positional parameter, or ` {:a>banana$} ` to take it from the parameter named ` banana ` \- note that the chosen parameter *must be an integer* (desired total width):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Padding depending on parameter: {0:02$} and {0:a>banana$}", 432, 0, 5, banana: 9)
    #assert.eq(s, "Padding depending on parameter: 00432 aaaaaa432")  // widths 5 and 9


  - *Displaying` + ` on positive numbers: * Just add a ` + ` at the âbeginningâ, i.e., before the ` #0 ` (if either is there), or after the custom fill and align (if itâs there and not ` 0 ` \- see [ Grammar ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oxifmt/0.2.1/#grammar) for the exact positioning), like so:



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Some numbers: {:+} {:+08}; With fill and align: {:_<+8}; Negative (no-op): {neg:+}", 123, 456, 4444, neg: -435)
    #assert.eq(s, "Some numbers: +123 +0000456; With fill and align: +4444___; Negative (no-op): -435")



  - *Converting numbers to bases 2, 8 and 16:* Use one of the following specifier types (i.e., characters which always go at the very end of the format): ` b ` (binary), ` o ` (octal), ` x ` (lowercase hexadecimal) or ` X ` (uppercase hexadecimal). You can also add a ` # ` between ` + ` and ` 0 ` (see the exact position at the [ Grammar ](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/oxifmt/0.2.1/#grammar) ) to display a *base prefix* before the number (i.e. ` 0b ` for binary, ` 0o ` for octal and ` 0x ` for hexadecimal):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("Bases (10, 2, 8, 16(l), 16(U):) {0} {0:b} {0:o} {0:x} {0:X} | W/ prefixes and modifiers: {0:#b} {0:+#09o} {0:_>+#9X}", 124)
    #assert.eq(s, "Bases (10, 2, 8, 16(l), 16(U):) 124 1111100 174 7c 7C | W/ prefixes and modifiers: 0b1111100 +0o000174 ____+0x7C")


  - *Picking float precision (right-extending with zeroes):* Add, at the end of the format (just before the spec type (such as ` ? ` ), if thereâs any), either ` .precision ` (hardcoded, e.g. ` .8 ` for 8 decimal digits) or ` .parameter$ ` (taking the precision value from the specified parameter, like with ` width ` ):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("{0:.8} {0:.2$} {0:.potato$}", 1.234, 0, 2, potato: 5)
    #assert.eq(s, "1.23400000 1.23 1.23400")


  - *Scientific notation:* Use ` e ` (lowercase) or ` E ` (uppercase) as specifier types (can be combined with precision):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("{0:e} {0:E} {0:+.9e} | {1:e} | {2:.4E}", 124.2312, 50, -0.02)
    #assert.eq(s, "1.242312e2 1.242312E2 +1.242312000e2 | 5e1 | -2.0000E-2")


  - *Customizing the decimal separator on floats:* Just specify ` fmt-decimal-separator: "," ` (comma as an example):



    #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1": strfmt

    #let s = strfmt("{0} {0:.6} {0:.5e}", 1.432, fmt-decimal-separator: ",")
    #assert.eq(s, "1,432 1,432000 1,43200e0")


===  Grammar

Hereâs the grammar specification for valid format ` spec ` s (in `
{name:spec} ` ), which is basically Rustâs format:



    format_spec := [[fill]align][sign]['#']['0'][width]['.' precision]type
    fill := character
    align := '<' | '^' | '>'
    sign := '+' | '-'
    width := count
    precision := count | '_'
    type := '' | '?' | 'x?' | 'X?' | identifier
    count := parameter | integer
    parameter := argument '$'


Note, however, that precision of type ` ._ ` is not supported yet and will
raise an error.

==  Changelog

===  v0.2.1

  - Fixed formatting of UTF-8 strings. Before, strings with multi-byte UTF-8 codepoints would cause formatting inconsistencies or even crashes. ( [ Issue #6 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-oxifmt/issues/6) )
  - Fixed an inconsistency in negative number formatting. Now, it will always print a regular hyphen (e.g. â-2â), which is consistent with Rustâs behavior; before, it would occasionally print a minus sign instead (as observed in a comment to [ Issue #4 ](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-oxifmt/issues/4) ).
  - Added compatibility with Typst 0.8.0âs new type system.

===  v0.2.0

  - The packageâs name is now ` oxifmt ` !
  - ` oxifmt:0.2.0 ` is now available through Typstâs Package Manager! You can now write ` #import "@preview/oxifmt:0.2.0": strfmt ` to use the library.
  - Greatly improved the README, adding a section for common examples.
  - Fixed negative numbers being formatted with two minus signs.
  - Fixed custom precision of floats not working when they are exact integers.

===  v0.1.0

  - Initial release, added ` strfmt ` .

=  zen-zine

0.1.0

Excellently type-set a fun little zine!

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=zen-zine&version=0.1.0)

Excellently type-set a cute little zine about your favorite topic!

Providing your eight pages in order will produce a US-Letter page with the
content in a layout ready to be folded into a zine! The content is wrapped
before movement so that padding and alignment are respected.

Here is the template and its preview:



    #import "@preview/zen-zine:0.1.0": zine

    #set document(author: "Tom", title: "Zen Zine Example")
    #set text(font: "Linux Libertine", lang: "en")

    #let my_eight_pages = (
      range(8).map(
        number => [
          #pad(2em, text(10em, align(center, str(number))))
        ]
      )
    )

    // provide your content pages in order and they
    // are placed into the zine template positions.
    // the content is wrapped before movement so that
    // padding and alignment are respected.
    #zine(
      // draw_border: true,
      // zine_page_margin: 5pt,
      contents: my_eight_pages
    )


![Image of
Template](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/zen-
zine/0.1.0/template/preview.png)

==  Improvement Ideas

Roughly in order of priority.

  - Write documentation and generate a manual
  - Deduce ` page ` properties so that user can change the page they wish to use.
    - Make sure the page is ` flipped ` and deduce the zine page width and height from the full page width and height (and the zine margin)
    - Iâm currently struggling with finding out the page properties (whatâs the ` #get ` equivalent to ` #set ` ?)
  - Add other zine sizes (there is a 16 page one I believe?)
  - Digital mode where zine pages are separate pages (of the same size) rather than âsub pagesâ of a printer page

= *minideck.md*

=  minideck

0.2.1

Simple dynamic slides.

A small package for dynamic slides in typst.

minideck provides basic functionality for dynamic slides ( ` pause ` , `
uncover ` , â¦), integration with [ fletcher
](https://typst.app/universe/package/fletcher) and [ CetZ
](https://typst.app/universe/package/cetz/) , and some minimal infrastructure
for theming.

==  Usage

Call ` minideck.config ` to get the functions you want to use:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide, title-slide, pause, uncover, only) = minideck.config()
    #show: template

    #title-slide[
      = Slides with `minideck`
      == Some examples
      John Doe

      #datetime.today().display()
    ]

    #slide[
      = Some title

      Some content

      #show: pause

      More content

      1. One
      2. Two
      #show: pause
      3. Three
    ]


This will show three subslides with progressively more content. (Note that the
default theme uses the font Libertinus Sans from the [ Libertinus
](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus) family, so you may want to install
it.)

Instead of ` #show: pause ` , you can use ` #uncover(2,3)[...] ` to make
content visible only on subslides 2 and 3, or ` #uncover(from: 2)[...] ` to
have it visible on subslide 2 and following.

The ` only ` function is similar to ` uncover ` , but instead of hiding the
content (without affecting the layout), it removes it.



    #slide[
      = `uncover` and `only`

      #uncover(1, from:3)[
        Content visible on subslides 1 and 3+
        (space reserved on 2).
      ]

      #only(2,3)[
        Content included on subslides 2 and 3
        (no space reserved on 1).
      ]

      Content always visible.
    ]


Contrary to ` pause ` , the ` uncover ` and ` only ` functions also work in
math mode:



    #slide[
      = Dynamic equation

      $
        f(x) &= x^2 + 2x + 1  \
             #uncover(2, $&= (x + 1)^2$)
      $
    ]


When mixing ` pause ` with ` uncover ` / ` only ` , the sequence of pauses
should be taken as reference for the meaning of subslide indices. For example
content after the first pause always appears on the second subslide, even if
itâs preceded by a call to ` #uncover(from: 3)[...] ` .

The package also works well with [ pinit
](https://typst.app/universe/package/pinit) :



    #import "@preview/pinit:0.1.4": *

    #slide[
      = Works well with `pinit`

      Pythagorean theorem:

      $ #pin(1)a^2#pin(2) + #pin(3)b^2#pin(4) = #pin(5)c^2#pin(6) $

      #show: pause

      $a^2$ and $b^2$ : squares of triangle legs

      #only(2, {
        pinit-highlight(1,2)
        pinit-highlight(3,4)
      })

      #show: pause

      $c^2$ : square of hypotenuse

      #pinit-highlight(5,6, fill: green.transparentize(80%))
      #pinit-point-from(6)[larger than $a^2$ and $b^2$]
    ]


===  Handout mode

minideck can make a handout version of the document, in which dynamic behavior
is disabled: the content of all subslides is shown together in a single slide.

To compile a handout version, pass ` --input handout=true ` in the command
line:



    typst compile --input handout=true myfile.typ


It is also possible to enable handout mode from within the document, as shown
in the next section.

===  Configuration

The behavior of the minideck functions depends on the settings passed to `
minideck.config ` . For example, handout mode can also be enabled like this:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide, pause) = minideck.config(handout: true)
    #show: template

    #slide[
      = Slide title

      Some text

      #show: pause

      More text
    ]


(The default value of ` handout ` is ` auto ` , in which case minideck checks
for a command line setting as in the previous section.)

` minideck.config ` accepts the following named arguments:

  - ` paper ` : a string for one of the paper size names recognized by [ ` page.paper ` ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-paper) , or one of the shorthands ` "16:9" ` or ` "4:3" ` . Default: ` "4:3" ` .
  - ` landscape ` : use the paper size in landscape orientation. Default: ` true ` .
  - ` width ` : page width as an absolute length. Takes precedence over ` paper ` and ` landscape ` .
  - ` height ` : page height as an absolute length. Takes precedence over ` paper ` and ` landscape ` .
  - ` handout ` : whether to make a document for handout, with content of all subslides shown together in a single slide.
  - ` theme ` : the theme (see below).
  - ` cetz ` : the CeTZ module (see below).
  - ` fletcher ` : the fletcher module (see below).

For example to make slides with 16:9 aspect ratio, use `
minideck.config(paper: "16:9") ` .

===  Themes

Use ` minideck.config(theme: ...) ` to select a theme. Currently there is only
one built-in: ` minideck.themes.simple ` . However you can also pass a theme
implemented by yourself or from a third-party package. See the [ theme
documentation
](https://github.com/typst/packages/raw/main/packages/preview/minideck/0.2.1/themes/README.md)
for how that works.

Themes are functions and can be configured using the standard [ ` with `
method ](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/#definitions-
with) :

  - The ` simple ` theme has a ` variant ` setting with values âlightâ (default) and âdarkâ.

Hereâs an example:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide) = minideck.config(
      theme: minideck.themes.simple.with(variant: "dark"),
    )
    #show: template

    #slide[
      = Slide with dark theme

      Some text
    ]


Note that you can override part of a theme with show and set rules:



    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide) = minideck.config(
      theme: minideck.themes.simple.with(variant: "dark"),
    )
    #show: template

    #set page(footer: none) // get rid of the page number
    #show heading: it => text(style: "italic", it)
    #set text(red)

    #slide[
      = Slide with dark theme and red text

      Some text
    ]


===  Integration with CeTZ

You can use ` uncover ` and ` only ` (but not ` pause ` ) in CeTZ figures,
with the following extra steps:

  - Get CeTZ-specific functions ` cetz-uncover ` and ` cetz-only ` by passing the CeTZ module to ` minideck.config ` (see example below).

This ensures that minideck uses CeTZ functions from the correct version of
CeTZ.

  - Add a ` context ` keyword outside the ` canvas ` call.

This is required to access the minideck subslide state from within the canvas
without making the content opaque (CeTZ needs to inspect the canvas content to
make the drawing).

Example:



    #import "@preview/cetz:0.2.2" as cetz: *
    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"

    #let (template, slide, only, cetz-uncover, cetz-only) = minideck.config(cetz: cetz)
    #show: template

    #slide[
      = In a CeTZ figure

      Above canvas
      #context canvas({
        import draw: *
        cetz-only(3, rect((0,-2), (14,4), stroke: 3pt))
        cetz-uncover(from: 2, rect((0,-2), (16,2), stroke: blue+3pt))
        content((8,0), box(stroke: red+3pt, inset: 1em)[
          A typst box #only(2)[on 2nd subslide]
        ])
      })
      Below canvas
    ]


===  Integration with fletcher

The same steps are required as for CeTZ integration (passing the fletcher
module to get fletcher-specific functions), plus an additional step:

  - Give explicitly the number of subslides to the ` slide ` function.

This is required because I could not find a reliable way to update a typst
state from within a fletcher diagram, so I cannot rely on the state to keep
track of the number of subslides.

Example:



    #import "@preview/fletcher:0.5.0" as fletcher: diagram, node, edge
    #import "@preview/minideck:0.2.1"
    #let (template, slide, fletcher-uncover) = minideck.config(fletcher: fletcher)
    #show: template

    #slide(steps: 2)[
      = In a fletcher diagram

      #set align(center)

      Above diagram

      #context diagram(
        node-stroke: 1pt,
        node((0,0), [Start], corner-radius: 2pt, extrude: (0, 3)),
        edge("-|>"),
        node((1,0), align(center)[A]),
        fletcher-uncover(from: 2, edge("d,r,u,l", "-|>", [x], label-pos: 0.1))
      )

      Below diagram
    ]


==  Comparison with other slides packages

Performance: minideck is currently faster than [ Polylux
](https://typst.app/universe/package/polylux/) when using ` pause ` ,
especially for incremental compilation, but a bit slower than [ Touying
](https://typst.app/universe/package/touying) , according to my tests.

Features: Polylux and Touying have more themes and more features, for example
support for [ pdfpc ](https://pdfpc.github.io/) which provides speaker notes
and more. Minideck allows using ` uncover ` and ` only ` in CeTZ figures and
fletcher diagrams, which Polylux currently doesnât support.

Syntax: package configuration is simpler in minideck than Touying but a bit
more involved than in Polylux. The minideck ` pause ` is more cumbersome to
use: one must write ` #show: pause ` instead of ` #pause ` . On the other hand
minideckâs ` uncover ` and ` only ` can be used directly in equations
without requiring a special math environment as in Touying (I think).

Other: minideck sometimes has better error messages than Touying due to
implementation differences: the minideck stack trace points back to the
userâs code while Touying errors sometimes point only to an output page
number.

==  Limitations

  - ` pause ` , ` uncover ` and ` only ` work in enumerations but they require explicit enum indices ( ` 1. ... ` rather than ` + ... ` ) as they cause a reset of the list index.
  - Usage in a CeTZ canvas or fletcher diagram requires a ` context ` keyword in front of the ` canvas ` / ` diagram ` call (see above).
  - fletcher diagrams also require to specify the number of subslides explicitly (see above).
  - ` pause ` doesnât work in CeTZ figures, fletcher diagrams and math mode.
  - ` pause ` requires writing ` #show: pause ` and its effect is lost after the ` #show ` call goes out of scope. For example this means that one can use ` pause ` inside of a grid, but further ` pause ` calls after the grid (in the same slide) wonât work as intended.

==  Internals

The package uses states with the following keys:

` __minideck-subslide-count ` : an array of two integers for counting pauses
and keeping track of the subslide number automatically. The first value is the
number of subslides so far referenced in current slide. The second value is
the number of pauses seen so far in the current slide. Both values are kept in
one state so that an update function can update the number of subslides based
on the number of pauses, without requiring a context. This avoids problems
with layout convergence.

` __minideck-subslide-step ` : the current subslide being generated while
processing a slide.

= *ez-today.md*

=  ez-today

0.1.0

Simply displays the full current date.

Simply displays the current date with easy to use customization.

==  Included languages

German, English, French and Italian months can be used out of the box. If you
want to use a language that is not included, you can easily add it yourself.
This is shown in the customization section below.

==  Usage

The usage is very simple, because there is only the ` today() ` function.



    #import "@preview/ez-today:0.1.0"

    // To get the current date use this
    #ez-today.today()


==  Reference

===  ` today `

Prints the current date with given arguments.



    #let today(
      lang: "de",
      format: "d. M Y",
      custom-months: ()
    ) = { .. }


*Arguments:*

  - ` lang ` : [ ` str ` ] â Select one of the included languages (de, en, fr, it).
  - ` format ` : [ ` str ` ] â Specify the output format.
  - ` custom-months ` : [ ` array ` ] of [ ` str ` ] â Use custom names for each month. This array must have 12 entries. If this is used, the ` lang ` argument does nothing.

==  Customization

The default output prints the full current date with German months like this:



    #ez-today.today()   // 11. Oktober 2024


You can choose one of the included languages with the ` lang ` argument:



    #ez-today.today(lang: "en")   // 11. October 2024
    #ez-today.today(lang: "fr")   // 11. Octobre 2024
    #ez-today.today(lang: "it")   // 11. Ottobre 2024


You can also change the format of the output with the ` format ` argument.
Pass any string you want here, but know that the following characters will be
replaced with the following:

  - ` d ` â The current day as a decimal
  - ` m ` â The current month as a decimal ( ` lang ` argument does nothing)
  - ` M ` â The current month as a string with either the selected language or the custom array
  - ` y ` â The current year as a decimal with the last two numbers
  - ` Y ` â The current year as a decimal

Here are some examples:



    #ez-today.today(lang: "en", format: "M d Y")    // October 11 2024
    #ez-today.today(format: "m-d-y")                // 10-11-24
    #ez-today.today(format: "d/m")                  // 11/10
    #ez-today.today(format: "d.m.Y")                // 11.10.2024


Use the ` custom-months ` argument to give each month a custom name. You can
add a new language or use short terms for each month.



    // Defining some custom names
    #let my-months = ("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
    // Get current date with custom names
    #ez-today.today(custom-months: my-months, format: "M-y")    // Oct-24


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` ez-today `



    #import "@preview/ez-today:0.1.0"

==  Documentation

===  ` card `

Defines a card by updating the below ` counter ` and ` state ` (s), and
dropping a label.



    #let card(header, footer, question, answer) = [
      #cardnumber.step()
      #cardheader.update(header)
      #cardfooter.update(footer)
      #cardquestion.update(question)
      #cardanswer.update(answer)
      <card>
    ]


====  Arguments

  - ` header `
  - ` footer `
  - ` question `
  - ` answer `

===  card builders

*How they work*

  1. Find all locations of the ` <card> ` label
  2. Get the values of the ` cardnumber ` counter, and ` cardheader ` , ` cardfooter ` , ` cardquestion ` , ` cardanswer ` states at each ` <card> ` .
  3. Populates an array of questions and an array of answers using these values
     - The ` #a48up ` and ` #letter8up ` functions describe the layout of each card for each item in these arrays, and also rearrange the answers so that the layout makes sense when printed double sided.
  4. Loop over the arrays and dump each itemâs ` content ` onto the page.
     - in the case of ` #a48up ` and ` letter8up ` , each item is dumped into a 2-column table.

` cartao ` comes builtin with the following card building functions. Take a
look at the source for how they work, and use them as a guide to help you
build your own flashcards with different sizes/formats.

===  ` a48up `

Produces a 2x8 portrait card layout on a4 paper.

Designed to be printed double-sided on the perforated 8-up a4 card paper you
can find on [ Amazon
](https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=a4+perforated+card&crid=37RT2L4H5XSD0&sprefix=a4+perforated+ca%2Caps%2C648&ref=nb_sb_noss)

= *tada.md*

=  tada

0.1.0

Easy, composable tabular data manipulation

TaDa provides a set of simple but powerful operations on rows of data. A full
manual is available online: [ https://github.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/blob/v0.1.0/docs/manual.pdf ](https://github.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/blob/v0.1.0/docs/manual.pdf)

Key features include:

  - *Arithmetic expressions* : Row-wise operations are as simple as string expressions with field names

  - *Aggregation* : Any function that operates on an array of values can perform row-wise or column-wise aggregation

  - *Data representation* : Handle displaying currencies, floats, integers, and more with ease and arbitrary customization

Note: This library is in early development. The API is subject to change
especially as typst adds more support for user-defined types. *Backwards
compatibility is not guaranteed!* Handling of field info, value types, and
more may change substantially with more user feedback.

==  Importing

TaDa can be imported as follows:

===  From the official packages repository (recommended):



    #import "@preview/tada:0.1.0"


===  From the source code (not recommended)

*Option 1:* You can clone the package directly into your project directory:



    # In your project directory
    git clone https://github.com/ntjess/typst-tada.git tada


Then import the functionality with



    #import "./tada/lib.typ"


*Option 2:* If Python is available on your system, use the provided
packaging script to install TaDa in typstâs ` local ` directory:



    # Anywhere on your system
      git clone https://github.com/ntjess/typst-tada.git
      cd typst-tada

      # Replace $XDG_CACHE_HOME with the appropriate directory based on
      # https://github.com/typst/packages#downloads
      python package.py ./typst.toml "$XDG_CACHE_HOME/typst/packages" \
        --namespace local



Now, TaDa is available under the local namespace:



    #import "@local/tada:0.1.0"


==  Creation

TaDa provides three main ways to construct tables â from columns, rows, or
records.

  - *Columns* are a dictionary of field names to column values. Alternatively, a 2D array of columns can be passed to ` from-columns ` , where ` values.at(0) ` is a column (belongs to one field).

  - *Records* are a 1D array of dictionaries where each dictionary is a row.

  - *Rows* are a 2D array where ` values.at(0) ` is a row (has one value for each field). Note that if ` rows ` are given without field names, they default to (0, 1, â¦$n$).



    #let column-data = (
      name: ("Bread", "Milk", "Eggs"),
      price: (1.25, 2.50, 1.50),
      quantity: (2, 1, 3),
    )
    #let record-data = (
      (name: "Bread", price: 1.25, quantity: 2),
      (name: "Milk", price: 2.50, quantity: 1),
      (name: "Eggs", price: 1.50, quantity: 3),
    )
    #let row-data = (
      ("Bread", 1.25, 2),
      ("Milk", 2.50, 1),
      ("Eggs", 1.50, 3),
    )

    #import tada: TableData
    #let td = TableData(data: column-data)
    // Equivalent to:
    #let td2 = tada.from-records(record-data)
    // _Not_ equivalent to (since field names are unknown):
    #let td3 = tada.from-rows(row-data)

    #to-tablex(td)
    #to-tablex(td2)
    #to-tablex(td3)


![Example 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-01.png)

==  Title formatting

You can pass any ` content ` as a fieldâs ` title ` . *Note* : if you pass
a string, it will be evaluated as markup.



    #let fmt(it) = {
      heading(outlined: false,
        upper(it.at(0))
        + it.slice(1).replace("_", " ")
      )
    }

    #let titles = (
      // As a function
      name: (title: fmt),
      // As a string
      quantity: (title: fmt("Qty")),
    )
    #let td = TableData(..td, field-info: titles)

    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-02.png)

==  Adapting default behavior

You can specify defaults for any field not explicitly populated by passing
information to ` field-defaults ` . Observe in the last example that ` price `
was not given a title. We can indicate it should be formatted the same as `
name ` by passing ` title: fmt ` to ` field-defaults ` . *Note* that any
field that is explicitly given a value will not be affected by ` field-
defaults ` (i.e., ` quantity ` will retain its string title âQtyâ)



    #let defaults = (title: fmt)
    #let td = TableData(..td, field-defaults: defaults)
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-03.png)

==  Using ` __index `

TaDa will automatically add an ` __index ` field to each row that is hidden by
default. If you want it displayed, update its information to set ` hide: false
` :



    // Use the helper function `update-fields` to update multiple fields
    // and/or attributes
    #import tada: update-fields
    #let td = update-fields(
      td, __index: (hide: false, title: "\#")
    )
    // You can also insert attributes directly:
    // #td.field-info.__index.insert("hide", false)
    // etc.
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-04.png)

==  Value formatting

===  ` type `

Type information can have attached metadata that specifies alignment, display
formats, and more. Available types and their metadata are:

  - *string* : (default-value: "", align: left)

  - *content* : (display: , align: left)

  - *float* : (align: right)

  - *integer* : (align: right)

  - *percent* : (display: , align: right)

  - *index* : (align: right)

While adding your own default types is not yet supported, you can simply
defined a dictionary of specifications and pass its keys to the field



    #let currency-info = (
      display: tada.display.format-usd, align: right
    )
    #td.field-info.insert("price", (type: "currency"))
    #let td = TableData(..td, type-info: ("currency": currency-info))
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-05.png)

==  Transposing

` transpose ` is supported, but keep in mind if columns have different types,
an error will be a frequent result. To avoid the error, explicitly pass `
ignore-types: true ` . You can choose whether to keep field names as an
additional column by passing a string to ` fields-name ` that is evaluated as
markup:



    #to-tablex(
      tada.transpose(
        td, ignore-types: true, fields-name: ""
      )
    )


![Example 6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-06.png)

===  ` display `

If your type is not available or you want to customize its display, pass a `
display ` function that formats the value, or a string that accesses ` value `
in its scope:



    #td.field-info.at("quantity").insert(
      "display",
      val => ("/", "One", "Two", "Three").at(val),
    )

    #let td = TableData(..td)
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-07.png)

===  ` align ` etc.

You can pass ` align ` and ` width ` to a given fieldâs metadata to
determine how content aligns in the cell and how much horizontal space it
takes up. In the future, more ` tablex ` setup arguments will be accepted.



    #let adjusted = update-fields(
      td, name: (align: center, width: 1.4in)
    )
    #to-tablex(adjusted)


![Example 8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-08.png)

==  Deeper ` tablex ` customization

TaDa uses ` tablex ` to display the table. So any argument that ` tablex `
accepts can be passed to TableData as well:



    #let mapper = (index, row) => {
      let fill = if index == 0 {rgb("#8888")} else {none}
      row.map(cell => (..cell, fill: fill))
    }
    #let td = TableData(
      ..td,
      tablex-kwargs: (
        map-rows: mapper, auto-vlines: false
      ),
    )
    #to-tablex(td)


![Example 9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-09.png)

==  Subselection

You can select a subset of fields or rows to display:



    #import tada: subset
    #to-tablex(
      subset(td, indexes: (0,2), fields: ("name", "price"))
    )


![Example 10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-10.png)

Note that ` indexes ` is based on the tableâs ` __index ` column, _not_
itâs positional index within the table:



    #let td2 = td
    #td2.data.insert("__index", (1, 2, 2))
    #to-tablex(
      subset(td2, indexes: 2, fields: ("__index", "name"))
    )


![Example 11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-11.png)

Rows can also be selected by whether they fulfill a field condition:



    #to-tablex(
      tada.filter(td, expression: "price < 1.5")
    )


![Example 12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-12.png)

==  Concatenation

Concatenating rows and columns are both supported operations, but only in the
simple sense of stacking the data. Currently, there is no ability to join on a
field or otherwise intelligently merge data.

  - ` axis: 0 ` places new rows below current rows

  - ` axis: 1 ` places new columns to the right of current columns

  - Unless you specify a fill value for missing values, the function will panic if the tables do not match exactly along their concatenation axis.

  - You cannot stack with ` axis: 1 ` unless every column has a unique field name.



    #import tada: stack

    #let td2 = TableData(
      data: (
        name: ("Cheese", "Butter"),
        price: (2.50, 1.75),
      )
    )
    #let td3 = TableData(
      data: (
        rating: (4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5),
      )
    )

    // This would fail without specifying the fill
    // since `quantity` is missing from `td2`
    #let stack-a = stack(td, td2, missing-fill: 0)
    #let stack-b = stack(stack-a, td3, axis: 1)
    #to-tablex(stack-b)


![Example 13](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-13.png)

==  Expressions

The easiest way to leverage TaDaâs flexibility is through expressions. They
can be strings that treat field names as variables, or functions that take
keyword-only arguments.

  - *Note* ! When passing functions, every field is passed as a named argument to the function. So, make sure to capture unused fields with ` ..rest ` (the name is unimportant) to avoid errors.



    #let make-dict(field, expression) = {
      let out = (:)
      out.insert(
        field,
        (expression: expression, type: "currency"),
      )
      out
    }

    #let td = update-fields(
      td, ..make-dict("total", "price * quantity" )
    )

    #let tax-expr(total: none, ..rest) = { total * 0.2 }
    #let taxed = update-fields(
      td, ..make-dict("tax", tax-expr),
    )

    #to-tablex(
      subset(taxed, fields: ("name", "total", "tax"))
    )


![Example 14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-14.png)

==  Chaining

It is inconvenient to require several temporary variables as above, or deep
function nesting, to perform multiple operations on a table. TaDa provides a `
chain ` function to make this easier. Furthermore, when you need to compute
several fields at once and donât need extra field information, you can use `
add-expressions ` as a shorthand:



    #import tada: chain, add-expressions
    #let totals = chain(td,
      add-expressions.with(
        total: "price * quantity",
        tax: "total * 0.2",
        after-tax: "total + tax",
      ),
      subset.with(
        fields: ("name", "total", "after-tax")
      ),
      // Add type information
      update-fields.with(
        after-tax: (type: "currency", title: fmt("w/ Tax")),
      ),
    )
    #to-tablex(totals)


![Example 15](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-15.png)

==  Sorting

You can sort by ascending/descending values of any field, or provide your own
transformation function to the ` key ` argument to customize behavior further:



    #import tada: sort-values
    #to-tablex(sort-values(
      td, by: "quantity", descending: true
    ))


![Example 16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-16.png)

==  Aggregation

Column-wise reduction is supported through ` agg ` , using either functions or
string expressions:



    #import tada: agg, item
    #let grand-total = chain(
      totals,
      agg.with(after-tax: array.sum),
      // use "item" to extract exactly one element
      item
    )
    // "Output" is a helper function just for these docs.
    // It is not necessary in your code.
    #output[
      _Grand total: #tada.display.format-usd(grand-total)_
    ]


![Example 17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntjess/typst-
tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-17.png)

It is also easy to aggregate several expressions at once:



    #let agg-exprs = (
      "# items": "quantity.sum()",
      "Longest name": "[#name.sorted(key: str.len).at(-1)]",
    )
    #let agg-td = tada.agg(td, ..agg-exprs)
    #to-tablex(agg-td)

tada/v0.1.0/assets/example-18.png)

Numeric Typst

==  Numty

===  Numeric Typst

A library for performing mathematical operations on n-dimensional matrices,
vectors/arrays, and numbers in Typst, with support for broadcasting and
handling NaN values. Numtyâs broadcasting rules and API are inspired by
NumPy.



    #import "numty.typ" as nt

    // Define vectors and matrices
    #let a = (1, 2, 3)
    #let b = 2
    #let m = ((1, 2), (1, 3))

    // Element-wise operations with broadcasting
    #nt.mult(a, b)  // Multiply vector 'a' by scalar 'b': (2, 4, 6)
    #nt.add(a, a)   // Add two vectors: (2, 4, 6)
    #nt.add(2, a)   // Add scalar '2' to each element of vector 'a': (3, 4, 5)
    #nt.add(m, 1)   // Add scalar '1' to each element of matrix 'm': ((2, 3), (2, 4))

    // Dot product of vectors
    #nt.dot(a, a)   // Dot product of vector 'a' with itself: 14

    // Handling NaN cases in mathematical functions
    #calc.sin((3, 4)) // Fails, as Typst does not support vector operations directly
    #nt.sin((3.4))    // Sine of each element in vector: (0.14411, 0.90929)

    // Generate equally spaced values and vectorized functions
    #let x = nt.linspace(0, 10, 3)  // Generate 3 equally spaced values between 0 and 10: (0, 5, 10)
    #let y = nt.sin(x)              // Apply sine function to each element: (0, -0.95, -0.54)

    // Logical operations
    #nt.eq(a, b)      // Compare each element in 'a' to 'b': (false, true, false)
    #nt.any(nt.eq(a, b)) // Check if any element in 'a' equals 'b': true
    #nt.all(nt.eq(a, b)) // Check if all elements in 'a' equal 'b': false

    // Handling special cases like division by zero
    #nt.div((1, 3), (2, 0))  // Element-wise division, with NaN for division by zero: (0.5, float.nan)

    // Matrix operations (element-wise)
    #nt.add(m, 1)  // Add scalar to matrix elements: ((2, 3), (2, 4))

    // matrix
    #nt.transpose(m)  // transposition
    #nt.matmul(m,m) //  matrix multipliation
    #nt.matmul(c(1,2), r(2,3)) //  colum vector times row vector multiplication.
    #np.trace(m) // trace
    #np.det(m) /2x2 determinant

    // printing
    #nt.print(m, " != " , (1,2))  // long dollar print, see in pdf
    #nt.p(m, " != " , (1,2))  //  short long print print, see in pdf


Since vesion 0.0.4 n-dim matrices are supported as well in most operations.

==  Supported Features:

===  Dimensions:

Numty uses standard typst list as a base type, most 1d operations like dot are
suported directly for them.

For matrix specific operations we use 2d arrays / nested arrays, that are also
the standard typst list, but nested like in: ((1,2), (1,1)).

For convenience you can create column or row vectors with the #nt.c and #nt.r
functions.



    #import "numty.typ" as nt
    #import "numty.typ": c, r

    #let a = (1,2,3)
    #let b = (3,2,1)
    #c(..a) // ((1,),(2,),(3,))
    #r(..b) // ((3,2,1),)
    #nt.matmul(c(..a), r(..b)) // column @ row



===  Logic Operations:



    #let a = (1,2,3)
    #let b = 2

    #nt.eq(a,b)  // (false, true, false)
    #nt.all(nt.eq(a,b))  // false
    #nt.any(nt.eq(a,b))  // true


===  Math operators:

All operators are element-wise, traditional matrix multiplication is not yet
supported.



    #nt.add((0,1,3), 1)  // (1,2,4)
    #nt.mult((1,3),(2,2)) // (2,6)
    #nt.div((1,3), (2,0)) // (0.5,float.nan)


===  Algebra with Nan handling:



    #nt.log((0,1,3)) //  (float.nan, 0 , 0.47...)
    #nt.sin((1,3)) //  (0.84.. , 0.14...)


===  Vector operations:

Basic vector operations



    #nt.dot((1,2),(2,4))  //  9
    #nt.normalize((1,4), l:1) // (1/5,4/5)


===  Others:

Functions for creating equally spaced indexes in linear and logspace, usefull
for log plots, to sample in acordance to the logarithmic space.



    #nt.linspace(0,10,3) // (0,5,10)
    #nt.logspace(1,3,3)
    #nt.geomspace(1,3,3)


===  Matrix



    #nt.matmul(m,m )              // matrix multiplication
    #nt.det(((1,3), (3,4)))       // only 2x2 supported for now
    #nt.trace(((1,3), (3,4)))     // trace of square matrix
    #nt.transpose(((1,3), (3,4))) // matrix transposition


===  Printing

Numty supports $ printing to the pdf of numerical matrices, both long and
short format.



    #nt.print((1,2),(4,2)))  // to display in the pdf
    #nt.p((1,2),(4,2)), " random string ")     // to display in the pdf
    #nt.p((1,2),(4,2)), " random string ")     // to display in the pdf


===  How to add

Copy this into your project and use the import as  ` numty `



    #import "@preview/numty:0.0.5"

Time to kill? Search for words in a box of letters!

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=cereal-words&version=0.1.0)

Oh no, the Typst guys jumbled the letters! Bring order into this mess by
finding the hidden words.

This small game is playable in the Typst editor and best enjoyed with the web
app or ` typst watch ` . It was first released for the 24 Days to Christmas
campaign in winter of 2023.

==  Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking âStart from
templateâ on the dashboard and searching for ` cereal-words ` .

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command



    typst init @preview/cereal-words


Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you
started.

==  Configuration

This template exports the ` game ` function, which accepts a single positional
argument for the game input.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the ` game `
function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this
template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:



    #import "@preview/cereal-words:0.1.0": game

[ Create project in app ](/app?template=flyingcircus&version=3.2.0)

Version 3.2.0

Do you want your homebrew to have the same fancy style as the Flying Circus
book? Do you want a simple command to generate a whole aircraft stat page,
vehicle, or even ship? Iâll bet you do! Take a look at the Flying Circus
Aircraft Catalog Template.

==  Acknowledgments and Useful Links

Download the fonts from [ HERE ](https://github.com/Tetragramm/flying-circus-
typst-template/archive/refs/heads/Fonts.zip) . Install them on your computer,
upload them to the Typst web-app (anywhere in the project is fine) or use the
Typst command line option --font-path to include them.

Based on the style and work (with the permission of) Erika Chappell for the [

==  Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on the
typst web app.



    #import "@preview/flyingcircus:3.2.0": *

    #show: FlyingCircus.with(
      Title: title,
      Author: author,
      CoverImg: image("images/cover.png"),
      Dedication: [It's Alive!!! MUAHAHAHA!],
    )

    #FCPlane(read("My Plane_stats.json"), Nickname:"My First Plane")


==  Usage

The first thing is the FlyingCircus style.



    #import "@preview/flyingcircus:3.2.0": *

    /// Defines the FlyingCircus template
    ///
    /// - Title (str): Title of the document. Goes in metadata and on title page.
    /// - Author (str): Author(s) of the document. Goes in metadata and on title page.
    /// - CoverImg (image): Image to make the first page of the document.
    /// - Description (str): Text to go with the title on the title page.
    /// - Dedication (str): Dedication to go down below the title on the title page.
    /// - body (content)
    /// -> content

    // Example
    #show: FlyingCircus.with(
      Title: title,
      Author: author,
      CoverImg: image("images/cover.png"),
      Dedication: [It's Alive!!! MUAHAHAHA!],
    )


Next is the FCPlane function for making plane pages.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Plane page.  Always on a new page. Image optional.
    ///
    /// - Plane (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the plane stats.
    /// - Nickname (str): Nickname to go under the aircraft name.
    /// - Img (image | none): Image to go at the top of the page. Set to none to remove.
    /// - BoxText (dictionary): Pairs of values to go in the box over the image. Does nothing if no Img provided.
    /// - BoxAnchor (str): Which anchor of the image to put the box in?  Sample values are "north", "south-west", "center".
    /// - DescriptiveText (content)
    /// -> content


    // Example
    #FCPlane(
      read("Basic Biplane_stats.json"),
      Nickname: "Bring home the bacon!",
      Img: image("images/Bergziegel_image.png"),
      BoxText: ("Role": "Fast Bomber", "First Flight": "1601", "Strengths": "Fastest Bomber"),
      BoxAnchor: "north-east",
    )[
    #lorem(100)
    ]


The FCVehicleSimple is for when you want to put multiple vehicles on a page.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Simple Vehicle.  Not always a full page. Image optional.
    ///
    /// - Vehicle (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the Vehicle stats.
    /// - Img (image): Image to go above the vehicle. (optional)
    /// - DescriptiveText (content)
    /// -> content
    #FCVehicleSimple(read("Sample Vehicle_stats.json"))[#lorem(120)]


FCVehicleFancy is a one or two page vehicle that looks nicer but takes up more
space.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Vehicle page.  Always on a new page. Image optional.
    /// If the Img is provided, it will take up two facing pages, otherwise only one, but a full page, unlike the Simple.
    ///
    /// - Vehicle (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the Vehicle stats.
    /// - Img (image | none): Image to go at the top of the first page. Set to none to remove.
    /// - TextVOffset (length): How far to push the text down the page. Want to do that inset text thing the book does? You can, the text can overlap with thte image.  Does nothing if no Img provided.
    /// - BoxText (dictionary): Pairs of values to go in the box over the image. Does nothing if no Img provided.
    /// - BoxAnchor (str): Which anchor of the image to put the box in?  Sample values are "north", "south-west", "center".
    /// - FirstPageContent (content): Goes on the first page. If no image is provided, it is not present.
    /// - AfterContent (content): Goes after the stat block. Always present.
    /// -> content

    // Example
    #FCVehicleFancy(
      read("Sample Vehicle_stats.json"),
      Img: image("images/Wandelburg.png"),
      TextVOffset: 6.2in,
      BoxText: ("Role": "Fast Bomber", "First Flight": "1601", "Strengths": "Fastest Bomber"),
      BoxAnchor: "north-east",
    )[
    #lorem(100)
    ][
    #lorem(100)
    ]


Last of the vehicles, FCShip is for boats like Into the Drink.



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Ship page.  Always on a new page. Image optional.
    ///
    /// - Ship (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the Ship stats.
    /// - Img (image | none): Image to go at the top of the page. Set to none to remove.
    /// - DescriptiveText (content): Goes below the name and above the stats table.
    /// - notes (content): Goes in the notes section.
    /// -> content

    // Example: No builder for Ships, so you'll have to put it in your own JSON, or just a dict, like this.
    #let ship_stats = (
      Name: "Macchi Frigate",
      Speed: 5,
      Handling: 15,
      Hardness: 9,
      Soak: 0,
      Strengths: "-",
      Weaknesses: "-",
      Weapons: (
        (Name: "x2 Light Howitzer", Fore: "x1", Left: "x2", Right: "x2", Rear: "x1"),
        (Name: "x6 Pom-Pom Gun", Fore: "x2", Left: "x3", Right: "x3", Rear: "x2", Up: "x6"),
        (Name: "x2 WMG", Left: "x1", Right: "x1"),
      ),
      DamageStates: ("", "-1 Speed", "-3 Guns", "-1 Speed", "-3 Guns", "Sinking"),
    )

    #FCShip(
      Img: image("images/Macchi Frigate.png"),
      Ship: ship_stats,
    )[
      #lorem(100)
    ][
      #lorem(5)
    ]


Additional functions include FCWeapon



    /// Defines the FlyingCircus Weapon card. Image optional.
    ///
    /// - Weapon (str | dictionary): JSON string or dictionary representing the Weapon stats.
    /// - Img (image | none): Image to go above the card. Set to none to remove.
    /// - DescriptiveText (content): Goes below the name and above the stats table.
    /// -> content

    //Example
    #FCWeapon(
      (Name: "Rifle/Carbine", Cells: (Hits: 1, Damage: 2, AP: 1, Range: "Extreme"), Price: "Scrip", Tags: "Manual"),
      Img: image("images/Rifle.png"),
    )[
    Note that you can set the text in the cell boxes to whatever you want.
    ]


KochFont:



    /// Sets the tex to the Koch Fette FC font for people who don't want to remember the font name.
    ///
    /// - body (content)
    /// - ..args: Any valid argument to the text function
    /// -> content

    // Example
    #KochFont(size: 18pt)[Vehicles]


and HiddenHeading, which is for adding to the table of contents without
actually putting words on the page.



    //If we don't want all our planes at the top level of the table of contents.  EX: if we want
    // - Intro
    // - Story
    // - Planes
    //   - First Plane
    // We break the page, and create a HiddenHeading, that doesn't show up in the document (Or a normal heading, if that's what you need)
    //Then we set the heading offset to one so everything after that is indented one level in the table of contents.
    #pagebreak()
    #HiddenHeading[= Vehicles]
    #set heading(offset: 1)


    New in Version 3.2.0, the FCPlaybook (+utilities), FCNPCShort, and FCAirshipShort

    //This creates pages like the playbook. Largely customizable, for say, chariots of steel versions.
    // - Name (str) The name of the Playbook
    // - Subhead (str) The text that goes with the name in the header
    // - Character (content) This is the entire left column
    // - Questions (content) This is the top section of the right column, for motivation and trust questions.
    // - Starting (content) Middle section of the right column. Starting Assets, Burdens, Planes, Vices, ect
    // - Stats (content) Bottom section of the right column. Just the four FCPStatTable calls (and a colbreak, probably)
    // - StatNames () Define the stats to draw circles for on the top part of the 2nd page
